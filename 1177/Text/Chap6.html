  <h2 id="toc_id_73">SEA PEOPLES, SYSTEMS COLLAPSE, <br/>AND COMPLEXITY THEORY</h2>

  <p class="normal">Colin Renfrew of Cambridge University, one of the most respected scholars ever to study the prehistoric Aegean region, had already suggested back in 1978 and 1979 that what we have just described is a “systems collapse.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref442" href="Notes.html#_ftn442" title="442">[442]</a></sup></span> This is a systemic failure, with both a domino and a multiplier effect, from which even such a globalized international, vibrant, intersocietal network as was pre sent during the Late Bronze Age could not recover.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the time, Renfrew framed his definition in terms of catastrophe theory, wherein “the failure of a minor element started a chain reaction that reverberated on a greater and greater scale, until finally the whole structure was brought to collapse.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref443" href="Notes.html#_ftn443" title="443">[443]</a></sup></span> A potentially useful metaphor that comes to mind is the so-called butterfly effect, whereby the initial flapping of a butterfly’s wings may eventually result in a tornado or hurricane some weeks later on the other side of the world.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref444" href="Notes.html#_ftn444" title="444">[444]</a></sup></span> We might, for example, cite the attack by the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I on the vaunted Hittite forces. His defeat of their army, at the end of the thirteenth century BC during Tudhaliya IV’s reign, may in turn have emboldened the neighboring Kashka to subsequently attack and burn the Hittite capital city of Hattusa.</p>

  <p class="normal">Renfrew noted the general features of systems collapse, itemizing them as follows: (1) the collapse of the central administrative organization; (2) the disappearance of the traditional elite class; (3) a collapse of the centralized economy; and (4) a settlement shift and population decline. It might also take as much as a century for all aspects of the collapse to be completed, he said, and, in an observation that is especially relevant to our analysis, he further noted that there is no single, obvious cause for the collapse. Moreover, in the aftermath of such a collapse, there would be a transition to a lower level of sociopolitical integration and the development of “romantic” Dark Age myths about the previous period.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref445" href="Notes.html#_ftn445" title="445">[445]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Not only does the concept of a systems collapse fit the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean region ca. 1200 BC, but, as Renfrew pointed out, it also describes the collapse of the Maya, Old Kingdom Egypt, and the Indus Valley civilization at various points in time. As mentioned, such topics and discussions of “collapses” throughout history, and of the possibly cyclical rise and fall of empires, have been taken up by other scholars as well, most popularly and recently by Jared Diamond.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref446" href="Notes.html#_ftn446" title="446">[446]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Not surprisingly, not every scholar agrees with the idea of a systems collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age. However, as we have seen, soon after 1200 BC, the Bronze Age civilizations did collapse in the Aegean, Eastern Mediterranean, and Near East, and they exhibit all of the classic features outlined by Renfrew, from disappearance of the traditional elite class and a collapse of central administrations and centralized economies to settlement shifts, population decline, and a transition to a lower level of sociopolitical integration, not to mention the development of stories like those of the Trojan War eventually gathered together by Homer in the eighth century BC. More than simply the coming of the Sea Peoples in 1207 and 1177 BC, more than the series of earthquakes that rocked Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean during a fifty-year span from 1225 to 1175 BC, more than the drought and climate change that may have been ravaging these areas during this period, what we see are the results of a systems collapse that brought down the flourishing cultures and peoples of the Bronze Age.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref447" href="Notes.html#_ftn447" title="447">[447]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In terms of assigning a date to these events, one can in fact argue that 1177 BC is to the end of the Late Bronze Age as AD 476 is to the end of Rome and the western Roman Empire. That is to say, both are dates to which modern scholars can conveniently point as the end of a major era, though they are simply chronological placeholders. In fact, Italy was invaded and Rome was sacked several times during the fifth century AD, including in AD 410 by the Visigoths and in AD 455 by the Vandals. There were also many other reasons why Rome fell, in addition to these attacks, and the story is much more complex, as any Roman historian will readily attest. However, it is convenient, and considered acceptable academic shorthand by many, to link the overthrow of the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in AD 476, with the end of Rome’s glory days.</p>

  <p class="normal">The end of the Late Bronze Age and the transition to the Iron Age is a similar case, insofar as the Collapse and transition constituted an ongoing event— the Mediterranean and Near Eastern world of 1200 BC was quite different from that of 1100 BC and completely different from that of 1000 BC. However, the second invasion by the Sea Peoples, ending in their cataclysmic fight against the Egyptians under Ramses III during the eighth year of his reign, in 1177 BC, is a reasonable benchmark that can be taken as representative of the entire Collapse and allows us to put a finite date on a rather elusive pivotal moment and the end of an age. It was a year when great land and sea battles were fought in the Nile delta; a year when Egypt struggled for its very survival; a year by which time some of the rich and powerful civilizations of the Bronze Age had already come to a crashing halt.</p>

  <p class="normal">We need to remember, though, that the collapse of these societies was caused not only by the specific events that we interpret from archaeological artifacts or read about in ancient texts— such as the megadrought, the famine, the earthquakes, and the invasions or revolts resulting in destructions— but also by the ripple effects, both direct and indirect. For example, when the trade routes were cut, raw materials such as copper from Cyprus and tin from Afghanistan, as well as gold from Egypt and silver from Greece, were probably harder to obtain. As a result, bronze was likely in short supply. The personal connections between rulers are likely to have been severed as well, meaning that international relations, treaties, and mutual defense pacts were probably nullified. Because of the drought, individual farmers will have been unable to grow their crops, resulting in the famine that we see recorded in the texts. Kingdoms and city-states, large and small, from Egypt and Canaan to Anatolia and the Aegean, began to have trouble meeting the basic needs of their citizens, as reported in the letters. It is not a stretch to suggest that their economies almost certainly began to falter as demand for goods outstripped available supplies. The smaller in de pen dent merchants may even have been forced out of business, unable to replenish basic inventories. Rebellions may well have spread, with the lower classes storming the palaces and storerooms of their rulers. We know that people began deserting the larger cities, seeking safe haven in less populated areas, perhaps with more fertile soil, and possibly away from roving gangs of bandits and invaders who had left their own homelands.</p>

  <p class="normal">It would not have taken long for the globalized, interconnected world of the Bronze Age Eastern Mediterranean and Aegean to grind to a halt, with economies disrupted and cities destroyed. Misery and migrations followed. Undoubtedly many were bewildered by the speed with which this happened, and some surely sought to explain the rapidity of decline by invoking angry gods.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point, we should recall the definition of collapse provided by Joseph Tainter, which was cited at the beginning of this book: “Collapse is fundamentally a sudden, pronounced loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref448" href="Notes.html#_ftn448" title="448">[448]</a></sup></span> However, I have also mentioned “transition” several times in the pages above, because collapse and transition can be two sides of the same coin. This is exactly what occurred at the end of the Late Bronze Age.</p>

  <p class="normal">Without question, the interconnected world that had existed for centuries came to an end, especially in terms of loss of coherence of society and sociopolitical complexity. Some groups not only experienced a diminished social structure but, for all intents and purposes, actually vanished. For instance, the Mycenaean and Minoan civilizations essentially disappeared and were eventually replaced. The same is true of the Hittites, who were supplanted by totally different groups in central Anatolia during the Iron Age, although some descendants survived in the Neo-Hittite city-states of northern Syria. On the other hand, the Assyrians displayed resiliency for a few more decades, before surrendering to the new reality. They experienced hard times before reemerging as the Neo-Assyrian Empire beginning in the ninth century BC— once again a power ful society able to conquer much of the Near East. Similarly, the Cypriots and the Egyptians displayed varying degrees of resilience and were able to transform and adapt to the new order after the Collapse. The Canaanites fall somewhere in between; most are superseded by the Israelites, Aramaeans, Philistines, and other denizens of new small Iron Age kingdoms and city-states, but some seem to survive, for example, as the Phoenicians. Thus, while there was an overall collapse of the known world in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean at the end of the Late Bronze Age, there were also instances of resilience and transition at the regional level—we could perhaps co-opt the phrase “Nevertheless, they persisted” for such cases.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref449" href="Notes.html#_ftn449" title="449">[449]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In 1987, Mario Liverani, of the University of Rome, laid the blame for the Collapse upon the concentration of power and control in the palaces, so that when they collapsed, the extent of the disaster was magnified. As he wrote, “the particular concentration in the Palace of all the elements of organization, transformation, exchange, etc.— a concentration which seems to reach its maximum in the Late Bronze Age— has the effect of transforming the physical collapse of the Palace into a general disaster for the entire kingdom.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref450" href="Notes.html#_ftn450" title="450">[450]</a></sup></span> In other words, to put it in modern investment terms, the Bronze Age rulers in the Aegean and the Near East should have diversified their portfolios, but they did not.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two decades later, Christopher Monroe cited Liverani’s work and suggested that the economy of the Late Bronze Age became unstable because of its increasing dependency on bronze and other prestige goods. Specifically, he saw “capitalist enterprise”—in which he included long-distance trade, and which dominated the palatial system pre sent in the Late Bronze Age—as having transformed traditional Bronze Age modes of exchange, production, and consumption to such an extent that when external invasions and natural catastrophes combined in a multiplier effect, the system was unable to survive.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref451" href="Notes.html#_ftn451" title="451">[451]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In writing about the situation at the end of the Late Bronze Age in his book <span class="italic">Scales of Fate</span>, Monroe describes the interactions of the various powers in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean as an “inter-societal network,” which agrees with the picture presented here. He points out, as I have, that this period is “exceptional in the treaties, laws, diplomacy, and exchange that created the first great international era in world history.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref452" href="Notes.html#_ftn452" title="452">[452]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">However, most interestingly, Monroe further notes that such networks have ways of postponing the inevitable collapse, which comes to all societies eventually. As he says, “revolts are quelled, raw materials are found, new markets are opened, price controls are put into effect, merchants’ properties are confiscated, embargoes [are] placed, and war is waged.” He also says, though, that “generally the rulers of the core power or powers treat the symptoms rather than the causes of instability,” and concludes that the “violent destruction of the Late Bronze palatial civilization, as attested in the textual and archaeological record, was, like many collapses, the inevitable result of limited foresight.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref453" href="Notes.html#_ftn453" title="453">[453]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">I agree with Monroe up until this last point, but here we must necessarily part ways, for I do not think that we are justified in blaming the Collapse simply on «limited foresight,” given the multiple probable factors explored above, which the ancient leaders could not possibly have completely predicted. In fact, Magnus Nordenman, who served as deputy director of the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, pointed out in his review of the first edition of this book that some would call these factors “black swan” events— defined as “unexpected and low-probability events with massive repercussions.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref454" href="Notes.html#_ftn454" title="454">[454]</a></sup></span> Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the best-selling author who popularized the term, points to the Harry Potter books, the spread of the internet, and calamities such as WW I as examples of events that were nearly impossible to predict but have had huge impacts.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref455" href="Notes.html#_ftn455" title="455">[455]</a></sup></span> More recently the term has been frequently invoked by those discussing the COVID-19 pandemic, though Taleb takes issue with this use; he says the term should not be used as “a cliché for any bad thing that surprises us,” and that the pandemic was both predicted and predictable (by himself and Bill Gates, among others)— a white swan, rather than a black one.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref456" href="Notes.html#_ftn456" title="456">[456]</a></sup></span> While Nordenman may be correct to assign the individual events that led to the Late Bronze Age Collapse to the black swan category, Monroe’s words might also serve as something of a warning for us today, for his description of the Late Bronze Age, especially in terms of its economy and interactions, could well apply to our current globalized society.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_74">A Review of Possibilities and Complexity Theory</h3>

  <p class="normal">As noted throughout this book, the so-called Collapse or Catastrophe at the end of the Late Bronze Age has been much discussed by scholars. Robert Drews tried to attack this problem systematically, devoting each chapter in his 1993 book to a discussion of a different potential cause. However, he may have misjudged and underestimated some of these; for instance, he dismissed out of hand the idea of a systems collapse, because he does not think that it explains why the palaces and cities were destroyed and burned. Instead, he believes that changes in warfare were actually responsible— a hypothesis upon which not all scholars agree.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref457" href="Notes.html#_ftn457" title="457">[457]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Now, as we have seen, nearly thirty years after the publication of Drews’s book, and even after all of the continuous debate and constant stream of academic publications on the topic, there is still no general consensus as to who, or what, caused the destruction or abandonment of each of the major sites within the civilizations that came to an end in the twilight of the Bronze Age. The problem, as we have discussed it in the previous chapters, can be concisely summarized as follows:</p>

  <h4>Major Observations</h4>

  <ol class="list_">
    <li>We have a number of separate civilizations that were flourishing during the fifteenth to thirteenth centuries BC in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, from the Mycenaeans and the Minoans to the Hittites, Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Canaanites, and Cypriots. These were in de pen dent but consistently interacted with each other, especially through international trade routes.</li>

    <li>It is clear that many cities were destroyed and that the Late Bronze Age civilizations and life as the inhabitants knew it in the Aegean, Eastern Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East came to an end ca. 1177 BC or soon thereafter.</li>

    <li>No unequivocal proof has been offered as to who or what caused this disaster, which resulted in the collapse of these civilizations and the end of the Late Bronze Age.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="toc_id_75">Discussion of Possibilities</h3>

  <p class="normal">As we have seen, there are a number of possible causes that may have led, or contributed, to the Collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age, but none seems capable of having caused the calamity on its own.</p>

  <ol class="list_">
    <li class="para24">There is archaeological evidence for invaders, or at least newcomers probably from the Aegean region, western Anatolia, Cyprus, or all of the above, found in the Levant from Ugarit in the north to Lachish in the south. Some of the cities were destroyed and then abandoned; others were reoccupied; and still Others were unaffected. </li>

    <li>There were earthquakes during this period, but usually societies can recover from these.</li>

    <li>There is textual evidence for famine, and now scientific evidence for droughts and climate change, in both the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean, but again societies have recovered from these time and time again.</li>

    <li>There may be circumstantial evidence for internal rebellions in Greece and elsewhere, including the Levant, although this is not certain. Again, societies frequently survive such revolts. Moreover, it would be unusual (notwithstanding recent experience in the middle East to the contrary) for rebellions to occur over such a wide area and for such a prolonged period of time.</li>

    <li>It is clear that the international trade routes were affected, if not completely cut, for a period of time, but the extent to which this would have impacted the various individual civilizations is not altogether clear— even if some were overly dependent upon foreign goods for their survival, as has been suggested in the case of the Mycenaeans.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="normal">As noted, the evidence presently available suggests that we may be seeing the result of a systems collapse that was caused by a series of events linked together via a multiplier effect, in which one factor affected the others, thereby magnifying the effects of each. Perhaps the inhabitants could have survived one disaster, such as an earthquake or a drought, but they could not survive the combined effects of drought, famine, invaders, and earthquakes all occurring in rapid succession. A domino effect then ensued, in which the disintegration of one civilization led to the fall of the others. Given the globalized nature of their world, the effect upon the international trade routes and economies of even one society’s collapse would have been sufficiently devastating that it could have led to the demise of the Others. If such were the case, they were not too big to fail.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, despite all of my comments above, systems collapse might also be just too simplistic an explanation to accept as the entire reason for the ending of the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean, Eastern Mediterranean, and Near East. It is possible that we need to turn to what is called complexity science, or, perhaps more accurately, complexity theory, in order to get a grasp of what may have led to the collapse of these civilizations.</p>

  <p class="normal">Complexity science or theory is the study of a complex system or systems, with the goal of explaining “the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects.” It has been used in attempts to explain, and sometimes solve, problems as diverse as traffic jams, stock market crashes, illnesses such as cancer, environmental change, and even wars, as Neil Johnson of Oxford University has written.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref458" href="Notes.html#_ftn458" title="458">[458]</a></sup></span> While it has made its way from the realm of mathematics and computational science to international relations, business, and other fields over the past several decades, it has only rarely been applied in the field of archaeology. Intriguingly, and perhaps presciently, Carol Bell explored the topic briefly in her 2006 book on the evolution of, and changes in, long-distance trading relationships in the Levant from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age. She noted that it was a promising theoretical approach that might be of use as an explanatory model for the cause of the Collapse and for the restructuring that followed. More recently, Harvard and Stanford University historian Niall Ferguson employed it in a <span class="italic">Foreign Affairs</span> article to discuss the collapse of various empires, beginning with the Roman Empire and continuing to the pre sent day.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref459" href="Notes.html#_ftn459" title="459">[459]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">For a problem to be a potential candidate for a complexity theory approach, Johnson states that it has to involve a system that “contains a collection of many interacting objects or ‘agents.’”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref460" href="Notes.html#_ftn460" title="460">[460]</a></sup></span> In our case, those would be the various civilizations active during the Late Bronze Age: the Mycenaeans, Minoans, Hittites, Egyptians, Canaanites, Cypriots, and so on. In one aspect of complexity theory, behavior of those objects is affected by their memories and “feedback” from what has happened in the past. They are able to adapt their strategies, partly on the basis of their knowledge of previous history. As Johnson points out, automobile drivers, for example, are generally familiar with the traffic patterns in their home area and are able to predict the fastest route to take to work or back home again. If a traffic jam arises, they are able to take alternative routes to avoid the problem.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref461" href="Notes.html#_ftn461" title="461">[461]</a></sup></span> Similarly, toward the end of the Late Bronze Age, seafaring merchants from Ugarit or elsewhere might have taken steps to avoid enemy ships or areas in which such ships and marauders were frequently based, including the coastal portions of the Lukka lands (i.e., the region later known as Lycia, in southwestern Anatolia).</p>

  <p class="normal">Johnson also states that the system is typically “alive,” meaning that it evolves in a nontrivial and often complicated way, and that it is also “open,” meaning that it can be influenced by its environment. As he puts it, this means that the complicated stock markets today, about which analysts often talk as if they were living, breathing organisms, can be influenced or driven by outside news about the earnings of a particular company or an event on the other side of the world. Just so, Sherratt—in her analogy published two decades ago, and quoted above in the preface— described the similarities between the Late Bronze Age world and our own “increasingly homogeneous yet uncontrollable global economy and culture, in which... political uncertainties on one side of the world can drastically affect the economies of regions thousands of miles away.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref462" href="Notes.html#_ftn462" title="462">[462]</a></sup></span> Such influences or stressors on the “system” in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean at the end of the Late Bronze Age might well be the probable, possible, and conceivable earthquakes, famine, drought, climate change, internal rebellion, external invasion, and cutting of the trade routes discussed above.</p>

  <p class="normal">The most important premise, we might argue, is that Johnson asserts that such a system exhibits phenomena that “are generally surprising, and may be extreme.” As he says, this “basically means that anything can happen— and if you wait long enough, it generally will.” For example, as he notes, all stock markets will eventually have some sort of crash, and all traffic systems will eventually have some kind of jam. These are generally un expected when they arise, and could not have been specifically predicted in advance, even though one knew full well that they could and would occur.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref463" href="Notes.html#_ftn463" title="463">[463]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In our case, since there has never been a civilization in the history of the world that hasn’t collapsed eventually, and since the reasons are frequently the same, as Jared Diamond and a host of others have pointed out, the eventual collapse of the Late Bronze Age civilizations was predictable, but it is unlikely that we would have been able to foresee exactly when it would happen, or that they would all collapse at the same time, even with a full working knowledge of each civilization. As Johnson writes, “even a detailed knowledge of the specifications of a car’s engine, colour and shape, is useless when trying to predict where and when traffic jams will arise in a new road system. Likewise, understanding individuals’ personalities in a crowded bar would give little indication as to what large-scale brawls might develop.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref464" href="Notes.html#_ftn464" title="464">[464]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">So what use might complexity theory be in the effort to explain the Collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age, if it cannot help us to rationalize why it happened? Or can it? Carol Bell pointed out that the trading networks of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean are examples of complex systems. She therefore cited the work of Ken Dark, of the University of Reading, who noted that “as such systems become more complex, and the degree of interdependence between their constituent parts grows, keeping the overall system stable becomes more difficult.” Known as “hyper-coherence,” this occurs, as Dark says, “when each part of the system becomes so dependent upon each other that change in any part produces instability in the system as a whole.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref465" href="Notes.html#_ftn465" title="465">[465]</a></sup></span> Thus, if the Late Bronze Age civilizations were truly globalized and dependent upon each other for goods and ser vices, even just to a certain extent, then change to any one of the relevant kingdoms, such as the Mycenaeans or the Hittites, would potentially affect and destabilize them all.</p>

  <p class="normal">Moreover, it is especially relevant that the kingdoms, empires, and societies of the Late Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean can each be seen as an individual sociopolitical system. As Dark says, such “complex socio-political systems will exhibit an internal dynamic which leads them to increase in complexity... [ T]he more complex a system is, the more liable it is to collapse.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref466" href="Notes.html#_ftn466" title="466">[466]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Thus, in the Late Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, we have individual sociopolitical systems, the various civilizations, that were growing more complex and thus apparently more liable to collapse. At the same time, we have complex systems, the trading networks, that were both interdependent and complicated in their relationships, and thus were open to instability the minute there was a change in one of the integral parts. Here is where one malfunctioning cog in another wise well-oiled machine might turn the entire apparatus into a pile of junk, just as a single thrown rod can wreck the engine of an expensive car today.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, rather than envisioning an apocalyptic ending overall— although perhaps certain cities and kingdoms like Ugarit met a dramatic, blazing end—we might better imagine that the finale of the Late Bronze Age was more a matter of a chaotic and gradual disintegration of areas and places that had once been major and in contact with each other, but were now diminished and isolated, like Mycenae, because of internal and/or external changes that affected one or more of the integral parts of the complex system. It is clear that such damage would have led to a disruption of the network.</p>

  <p class="normal">In terms of today’s world, we might picture a modern power grid that has been disrupted, perhaps by a storm or an earthquake, wherein the electric company can still produce power but cannot get it out to the individual consumers. We see such events on an annual basis in the United States, caused by anything and everything from tornadoes in Oklahoma to snowstorms in Massachusetts. If the disruption is permanent, as might be the case in a major catastrophe, such as a nuclear explosion today, eventually even the production of the electricity will halt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Similarly, and more recently, the COVID-19 novel coronavirus has acted as a worldwide disruptive agent. When the first factories in China shut down because workers were staying home, components for items like iPhones and even Ford and Kia automobiles became harder to find. Financial stocks also fluctuated sharply, as the virus began to spread around the world and fears mounted of a coming pandemic. As nation after nation issued “stay at home” orders, businesses closed and job losses skyrocketed, with more than thirty million people filing for unemployment benefits in the United States alone during a six-week period in March and April 2020— the largest number since the Great Depression.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref467" href="Notes.html#_ftn467" title="467">[467]</a></sup></span> An international system of supply chains and financial markets was thus significantly disrupted in a matter of weeks by one fast-spreading virus, which was soon being referred to by newscasters as a “black swan” event— a term that at first had to be explained to most viewers but was now suddenly in common usage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Even though Taleb disagrees with this use of the term that he coined, it would seem that his views align with Dark’s and with the concept of hyper-coherence. “The great danger has always been too much connectivity,” he said to Bernard Avishai in an interview published in the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> in late April 2020. Avishai’s next sentences concerning their conversation invoke the same points that we have just mentioned: “Proliferating global networks, both physical and virtual, inevitably incorporate more... risks into a more interdependent and ‘fragile’ system,” he wrote. “Any negative event along these lines can create a rolling, widening collapse— a true black swan—in the same way that the failure of a single transformer can collapse an electricity grid.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref468" href="Notes.html#_ftn468" title="468">[468]</a></sup></span> They could just as easily have been talking about 1177 BC rather than AD 2020.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Bell has noted, when a complex system does collapse, it “decomposes into smaller entities,” which is exactly what we see in the Iron Age that follows the end of these Bronze Age civilizations.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref469" href="Notes.html#_ftn469" title="469">[469]</a></sup></span> Thus, it seems that employing complexity theory, which allows us to take both catastrophe theory and systems collapse one step further, may be the best approach to explaining the end of the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean in the years following 1200 BC. The real questions are not so much “Who did it?” or “What event caused it?”— for there seem to have been any number of elements and people involved— but rather “Why did it happen?” and “How did it happen?” whether it could have been avoided is yet another question entirely.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, in suggesting that complexity theory should be brought to bear on the analysis of the causes of the Late Bronze Age Collapse, we may just be applying a scientific (or possibly pseudoscientific) term to a situation in which there is insufficient knowledge to draw firm conclusions. It sounds nice, but does it really advance our understanding? Is it more than just a fancy way to state a fairly obvious fact, namely, that complicated things can break down in a variety of ways?</p>

  <p class="normal">There is little doubt that the collapse of the Late Bronze Age civilizations was complex in its origins. We do know that many possible variables may have had a contributing role in the Collapse, but we are not even certain that we know all of the variables, and we undoubtedly do not know which ones were critical—or whether some were locally important but had little systemic effect. To carry our analogy of a modern traffic jam further: we do know most of the variables in a traffic jam. We know something about the number of cars and the roads they traveled along (whether wide or narrow) and we are certainly able to predict to a large extent the effect of some external variables, for example, a blizzard on a major thruway. But for the Late Bronze Age, we suspect, though we do not know for certain, that there were hundreds more variables than there are in a modern traffic system.</p>

  <p class="normal">Moreover, the argument that the Bronze Age civilizations were increasing in complexity and were therefore prone to collapse does not really make all that much sense, especially when one considers their “complexity” relative to that of the Eu ro pean civilizations of the last three hundred years. Thus, while it is possible that complexity theory might be a useful way to approach the Late Bronze Age Collapse once we have more information available as to the details of all the relevant civilizations, it may not be of much use at this stage, except as an interesting way to reframe our awareness that a multitude of factors were pre sent at the end of the Late Bronze Age that could have helped destabilize, and ultimately led to the collapse of, the international system that had been in place, functioning quite well at various levels, for several previous centuries.</p>

  <p class="normal">And yet, scholarly publications still continue to suggest a linear progression for the Late Bronze Age Collapse, despite the fact that it is not accurate to simply state that a drought caused famine, which eventually caused the Sea Peoples to start moving and creating havoc, which caused the Collapse.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref470" href="Notes.html#_ftn470" title="470">[470]</a></sup></span> Although true to some extent, the progression wasn’t quite that linear; the reality was much more complex. Although it now seems clear that climate change, manifested in the form of the megadrought in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean as well as possible droughts elsewhere, was probably the major driver, it is also clear that it was not the only trigger. Instead, there were a number of different stressors, each of which forced the people to react in different ways to accommodate the changing situation(s). Complexity theory, especially in terms of visualizing a nonlinear progression and a series of stressors rather than a single driver, is therefore advantageous both in explaining the Collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age and in providing a way forward for continuing to study this catastrophe.</p>

  <p class="normal">Many questions still remain unanswered, however. We do not know whether the various entities (Hittites, Mycenaeans, Egyptians, etc.) knew they were in the midst of a collapse of their society. We do not know whether there were organized efforts to evaluate and remedy the overall evolving situation and look to the future. We do not yet have any indications in the archaeological remains or textual records that anyone at the time was aware of the larger picture.</p>

  <p class="normal">And, even if they did know, could the leaders of the individual societies have done anything to slow the spread of decay or to prevent the ultimate collapse? There were certainly individual efforts to counter the effects of famine and drought (e.g., grain ships sent by the Egyptians; possible breeding of drought-resistant cattle and crops in the Levant), but apparently they were for naught. It has been pointed out elsewhere, though, that in virtually all such previous collapses, «there were sages or scholars who had a reasonably good understanding of what was happening and how it might be avoided.” However, “If they were listened to at all... their advice was typically followed too little and too late.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref471" href="Notes.html#_ftn471" title="471">[471]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In a recent article entitled “Lessons from the Past, Policies for the Future,” Prince ton professor John Haldon and his coauthors noted that the manner in which previous societies have responded to stress depends upon three things: their complexity, their flexibility, and their systemic redundancy, “all of which together determine the resilience of the system.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref472" href="Notes.html#_ftn472" title="472">[472]</a></sup></span> So could those Late Bronze Age societies have done a better job of banding together to support each other in a time of crisis? One would certainly think so, but we cannot know this for certain. This is where additional discussions about network resiliency and robustness might come into play, along with further studies involving agent-based modeling (ABM) and simulations in which various scenarios are modeled in order to demonstrate what would or would not have worked to stave off the coming calamity.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref473" href="Notes.html#_ftn473" title="473">[473]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">While there is irrefutable evidence that computer modeling was not available during the Late Bronze Age in either the Aegean or Eastern Mediterranean, it is available today. One might therefore reasonably ask, perhaps rather urgently, whether there are potential lessons to be learned from studying the evolving collapse of civilizations in that distant era— lessons that might be applicable to our current situation. As Mark Twain reportedly once said, history might not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</p>
