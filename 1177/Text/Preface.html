  <h1 id="toc_id_2">Author’s Preface to the<br/>revised and updated edition</h1>

  <p class="normal">In early 2020, as I was working on the revision of this book, I saw a banner headline in the Guardian: “Humanity under Threat from Perfect Storm of Crises.” “The world is facing a series of interlinked emergencies that are threatening the [very] existence of humans,” wrote environmental correspondent Fiona Harvey. She was reporting on the results of a survey taken of 222 leading scientists from 52 countries. They had concluded that there are a number of principal emergencies facing us today: climate change with weather extremes; species loss; water scarcity; and a food production crisis. What was particularly worrisome, she said, is that “the combination of all… is amplifying the risks of each, creating a perfect storm that threatens to engulf humanity unless swift action is taken.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref1" href="Notes.html#_ftn1" title="1">[1]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">I found that alarming, of course, but also intriguing, for the contemporary situation that she describes has many similarities to 1177 BC. That was a time more than three thousand years ago, when the Bronze Age Mediterranean civilizations collapsed one after the other, changing the course of history. Clearly calamitous collapses have happened before; could it happen again?</p>

  <p class="normal">It’s a question I’ve been asking since 2014, when the first edition of this book was published. I have long believed that the answer is yes; it’s a matter of not if but when.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then the COVID-19 pandemic hit full force, with devastating effects worldwide, millions of people infected, and hundreds of thousands dead. The full effects of this pestilence on top of the perfect storm of other stressors affecting our globalized world remains to be seen. But it is already clear that the future history of life on this planet will be changed, perhaps as fundamentally as life changed in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean regions some thirty-two hundred years ago. Now, however, the changes that lie ahead are not limited to those areas but are global in scope.</p>

  <p class="normal">I argued in the first edition of this book that 1177 BC was a pivotal moment in the history of civilization— a turning point for the ancient world. By that time, the Bronze Age in the Aegean, Egypt, and the Near East had lasted nearly two thousand years, from approximately 3000 BC to just after</p>

  <p class="normal">1200 BC. When the end came, as it did after centuries of cultural and technological evolution, most of the civilized and international world of the Mediterranean regions came to a dramatic halt in a vast area stretching from what is now Italy to Afghanistan and from Turkey down to Egypt. Large empires and small kingdoms, which had taken centuries to evolve, collapsed rapidly, from the Mycenaeans and Minoans to the Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Mitannians, Cypriots, Canaanites, and even Egyptians.</p>

  <p class="normal">And with their end came a period of transition, frequently described by scholars as the world’s first Dark Age. It was not until centuries later that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting the stage for the evolution of society as we know it today.</p>

  <p class="normal">Since those Bronze Age civilizations and the factors that led to their collapse transpired more than three millennia ago, there are many who assume that little of it is relevant to us today, and that there is no valid comparison to be made between the world of the Late Bronze Age and our current technology-driven culture. However, there are more parallels between the two eras than one might think. For example, in the Late Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, there were diplomatic embassies and economic trade embargoes; magnificent marriages and unpleasant divorces; international intrigues and deliberate military disinformation; rebellions and migrations; and climate change, including drought.</p>

  <p class="normal">After nearly a lifetime of studying the Bronze Age, it is my belief that taking a closer look at the events, peoples, and places of an era more than three millennia distant from us is more than merely an academic exercise in studying ancient history.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref2" href="Notes.html#_ftn2" title="2">[2]</a></sup></span> It is especially relevant now, considering what we have all been going through recently in our own globalized and transnationalized society, where we also find complex diplomatic embassies (think North Korea) and economic trade embargoes (think China); magnificent royal marriages (William and Kate; Harry and Meghan); international intrigues and deliberate military disinformation (think Ukraine); rebellions (Arab Spring) and migrations (Syrian refugees); and, of course, climate changes and pestilence (COVID-19).</p>

  <p class="normal">I strongly suspect that future historians will see the year 2020 as another pivotal moment in history. It is clear that in our global economy, the fortunes and investments of the United States and Eu rope are inextricably intertwined within an international system that also involves East Asia and the oil-producing nations of the Middle East. What if we are just at the beginning of another perfect storm of stressors on our interconnected societies? Although most people will survive the current COVID-19 pandemic, its repercussions, both economic and other wise, are likely to be felt for a long time. Furthermore, we may try to slow down climate change, but some effects are probably already irreversible, and famine is now widespread in the developing world. Are other cataclysmic events on the way? Recall that the Apocalypse has other horsemen besides Pestilence and Famine. Will we exhibit sufficient resilience to overcome whatever else is thrown at us, or are we headed for a collapse of multiple elements of our complex global society?</p>

  <p class="normal">According to Joseph Tainter, who literally wrote the book on the collapse of complex societies, “collapse is fundamentally a sudden, pronounced loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref3" href="Notes.html#_ftn3" title="3">[3]</a></sup></span> That was exactly what happened back in 1177 BC. We should note, though, that discussing “collapses” and comparing the rise and fall of empires is not new; scholars have been doing it since at least the 1700s, when Edward Gibbon wrote about the fall of the Roman Empire. A more recent example is Jared Diamond’s book Collapse.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref4" href="Notes.html#_ftn4" title="4">[4]</a></sup></span> However, both Gibbon and Diamond were considering how a single empire or a single civilization came to an end— the Romans, the Maya, the Mongols, and so forth. Here, we are considering a globalized system in antiquity, with multiple civilizations all interacting and at least partially dependent upon each other. There are only a few instances in history of such globalized world systems; the one in place during the Late Bronze Age and the one in place today are two of the most obvious examples, and the parallels— comparisons might be a better word— between them are sometimes intriguing.</p>

  <p class="normal">To give just one illustration, Carol Bell, a British academician, has observed that “the strategic importance of tin in the LBA [Late Bronze Age]… was probably not far different from that of crude oil today.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref5" href="Notes.html#_ftn5" title="5">[5]</a></sup></span> At that time, tin is thought to have been available in quantity only from specific mines in the Badakhshan region of Afghanistan and had to be brought overland all the way to sites in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and north Syria, from where it was distributed to points farther north, south, or west, including onward across the sea to the Aegean. Bell continues, “The availability of enough tin to produce... weapons grade bronze must have exercised the minds of the Great King in Hattusa and the Pharaoh in Thebes in the same way that supplying gasoline to the American SUV driver at reasonable cost preoccupies an American President today!” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref6" href="Notes.html#_ftn6" title="6">[6]</a></sup></span></p>

  <h2 id="toc_id_3">Preface to the Revised Edition</h2>

  <p class="normal">Susan Sherratt, an archaeologist formerly at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and now at the University of Sheffield, began arguing for such a comparison nearly twenty years ago. As she noted, there are some “genuinely useful analogies” between the world of 1200 BC and that of today, including an increase in political, social, and economic fragmentation, as well as the conducting of direct exchange at “unprecedented social levels and over unprecedented distances.” Most relevant is her observation that the situation at the end of the Late Bronze Age provides an analogy for our own “increasingly homogeneous yet uncontrollable global economy and culture, in which... political uncertainties on one side of the world can drastically affect the economies of regions thousands of miles away.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref7" href="Notes.html#_ftn7" title="7">[7]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">The historian Fernand Braudel once said, “The story of the Bronze Age could easily be written in dramatic form: it is replete with invasions, wars, pillage, political disasters and long-lasting economic collapses, ‘the first clashes between peoples.’” He also suggested that the history of the Bronze Age can be written “not only as a saga of drama and violence, but as a story of more benign contacts: commercial, diplomatic (even at this time), and above all cultural.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref8" href="Notes.html#_ftn8" title="8">[8]</a></sup></span> Braudel’s suggestions have been taken to heart, and so here I pre sent the story (or rather, stories) of the Late Bronze Age as a play in four acts, with appropriate narrative and flashbacks to provide proper contexts for the introduction of some of the major players, as they first appeared on the world stage and then made their exits: from Tudhaliya of the Hittites and Tushratta of Mitanni to Amenhotep III of Egypt and Assuruballit of Assyria (a glossary, “Dramatis Personae,” has been provided at the back of the book, for those wishing to keep the names and dates straight).</p>

  <p class="normal">However, our narrative will also be something of a detective story, with twists and turns, false leads, and significant clues. To quote Hercule Poirot, the legendary Belgian detective created by Agatha Christie, who was herself married to an archaeologist, we will need to use our «little grey cells” in order to weave together the various strands of evidence at the end of our chronicle, as we attempt to answer the question of why a stable international system suddenly collapsed after flourishing for centuries.</p>

  <p class="normal">Moreover, in order to truly understand what collapsed in 1177 BC and why it was such a decisive moment in ancient history, we must begin earlier, just as one might wish to go back to the eighteenth century AD and begin with the culmination of the Enlightenment period, the Industrial Revolution, and the founding of the United States, in order to really understand the origins of today’s globalized world. Although I am primarily interested in examining the possible causes of the collapse of the Bronze Age civilizations in this area, I also raise the question of what it was that the world lost at this pivotal moment, when the empires and kingdoms of the second millennium BC came crashing down. I am also interested in the extent to which civilization in this part of the world was set back, in some places for centuries, and altered irrevocably. The magnitude of the catastrophe was enormous; it was a loss such as the world would not see again until the Roman Empire collapsed more than fifteen hundred years later.</p>

  <p class="normal">This revised edition of 1177 B.C. updates both the original version that appeared in 2014 and the paperback with a new afterword in 2015. The principal changes will be found toward the end of the book, which has been augmented and reorganized, but changes and additions have been made throughout the other chapters as well.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref9" href="Notes.html#_ftn9" title="9">[9]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">The majority of the new data are textual and scientific discoveries bearing upon the Collapse that have appeared since the publication of the first edition of this book. These include additional texts from the site of Ugarit in north Syria published in 2016, some of which specifically mention nearby invaders and famine in the city just before it was destroyed. There is also a new and very important DNA study, published in July 2019, of burials found in the Philistine city of Ashkelon that date to the late twelfth century BC. The results appear to indicate that the Philistines, who were part of the Sea Peoples, did indeed migrate from either the Aegean or the western Mediterranean, according to the most likely gen e tic models. There are also new data from studies of lake sediments, stalagmites in caves, and coring from lakes and lagoons, in regions stretching from Italy and Greece to Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Iran. All point ever more conclusively to the occurrence of a megadrought that impacted much of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean beginning ca. 1200 BC and lasting between 150 and 300 years.</p>

  <p class="normal">I will end by simply noting again my belief that we would do well to heed what happened to the flourishing kingdoms of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean during the Collapse at the end of the Bronze Age. We are not as far removed from those days as one might think; COVID-19 has just exposed a vulnerability of modern societies to one of the forces of nature. The story that unfolds here thus has its own inherent fascination, but it should also remind us of the fragility of our own world.</p>
