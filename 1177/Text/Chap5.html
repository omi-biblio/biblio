  <h2 id="toc_id_64">A “PERFECT STORM” OF CALAMITIES?</h2>

  <p class="normal">We are now finally in a position to attempt to solve our mystery, by pulling together all of the different strands of evidence and the clues that are available, so that we may determine why the stable international system of the Late Bronze Age suddenly collapsed after surviving for centuries. However, we must come to this with an open mind and employ “the scientific use of the imagination,” as the immortal Sherlock Holmes once said, for “we must balance probabilities and choose the most likely.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref335" href="Notes.html#_ftn335" title="335">[335]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">To begin with, it will be apparent by now that the Sea Peoples and the so-called Collapse or Catastrophe at the end of the Late Bronze Age are both topics that have been much discussed by scholars over the course of the past century, and that they are linked more often than not in such discussions. This was especially true during the 1980s and 1990s, when Nancy Sandars published the revised edition of her book, simply called <span class="italic">The Sea Peoples</span>, in 1985 and Robert Drews published his book <span class="italic">The End of the Bronze Age</span> in 1993. There were also at least two academic conferences or seminars specifically devoted to these topics, held in 1992 and 1997, and many other books, theses, and conferences were tangentially related. <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref336" href="Notes.html#_ftn336" title="336">[336]</a></sup></span> However, as noted at the beginning of this volume, a wealth of new data has become available in the past few decades, which need to be considered in our evolving understanding of both the Sea Peoples and the complex forces that ended the era of magnificent civilizations that we have been discussing.</p>

  <p class="normal">We need to acknowledge first and foremost, as frequently noted in the preceding pages, that it is not always clear who, or what, caused the destruction of the Late Bronze Age cities, kingdoms, and empires of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. The destruction of the Palace of Nestor at Pylos, ca. 1180 BC, is an excellent example, as one scholar has recently acknowledged: “Some have suggested that the agents of this calamity were invaders from outside the kingdom; others that the people of Pylos themselves revolted against their king. The precise causes remain undetermined.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref337" href="Notes.html#_ftn337" title="337">[337]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Second, we need to admit that there is currently no scholarly consensus as to the cause or causes of the collapse of these multiple interconnected societies just over three thousand years ago; culprits recently blamed by scholars include “attacks by foreign enemies, social uprising, natural catastrophes, systems collapse, and changes in warfare.” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref338" href="Notes.html#_ftn338" title="338">[338]</a></sup></span> It is therefore worth our time to reconsider, as scholars have done for approximately the past eighty years, what the possible causes might be. In so doing, however, we should objectively consider the available evidence that supports or fails to support each of the hypothetical possibilities.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_65">Earthquakes</h3>

  <p class="normal">Let’s begin with earthquakes. The idea that they caused, or might have contributed to, the destruction of some of the Late Bronze Age cities has been around since the days of Claude Schaeffer, the original excavator of Ugarit. He thought that an earthquake caused the final destruction of the city, for he found visible indications that an earthquake had rocked the city in the distant past. Photo graphs from Schaeffer’s excavations, for example, show long stone walls knocked off kilter, which is one of the hallmarks of earthquake damage.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref339" href="Notes.html#_ftn339" title="339">[339]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">However, current thinking on the subject puts the date of this earthquake at Ugarit at 1250 BC or a bit thereafter. Moreover, because there are signs of restoration activities in the decades between the earthquake and the final demise of the city, it is now thought that the quake only damaged the city and did not completely destroy it.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref340" href="Notes.html#_ftn340" title="340">[340]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">It is, admittedly, frequently difficult to distinguish between a city destroyed by an earthquake and a city destroyed by humans and warfare. However, there are several markers that characterize a destructive earthquake and which can be noted by archaeologists during excavations. These include collapsed, patched, or reinforced walls; crushed skeletons, or bodies found lying under fallen debris; toppled columns lying parallel to one another; slipped keystones in archways and doorways; and walls leaning at impossible angles or offset from their original position. In contrast, a city destroyed during warfare will usually have weapons of various sorts within the destruction debris. At the site of Aphek, in Israel, for example, which was destroyed toward the end of the thirteenth century BC, the excavators found arrowheads stuck in the walls of the buildings, just as there are in Troy VIIA.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref341" href="Notes.html#_ftn341" title="341">[341]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Thanks to recent research by archaeoseismologists, it now seems probable that mainland Greece, as well as much of the rest of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, was struck by a series of earthquakes, beginning about 1225 BC and lasting for as long as fifty years, until about 1175 BC. The earthquake at Ugarit identified and described by Schaeffer was not an isolated event; it was just one of many such quakes that occurred during this time period. Such a series of earthquakes in antiquity is now known as an “earthquake storm,” in which a seismic fault keeps “unzipping” by unleashing a series of earthquakes over years or decades until all the pressure along the fault line has been released.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref342" href="Notes.html#_ftn342" title="342">[342]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In the Aegean, earthquakes probably hit during this time period at Mycenae, Thebes, Pylos, Kynos, Lefkandi, the Menelaion, Kastanas in Thessaly, Korakou, Profitis Elias, and Gla, as well as Tiryns and Midea, though the evidence at these last two sites has now been called into question by one group of researchers, as mentioned. There is no evidence that Crete was affected at this time. In the Eastern Mediterranean, however, earthquake damage dating to this period is visible at numerous sites, including Troy, Karaoglun, and Hattusa in Anatolia; Ugarit, Beth Shan, Deir ‘Alla, Tell es-Saidiyeh, Tell al-Umayri, Ashdod, and Akko in the Levant; and Enkomi on Cyprus, among Others.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref343" href="Notes.html#_ftn343" title="343">[343]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">And, just as people are killed during the collapse of buildings and are buried in the rubble when an earthquake hits a populated area today, so too at least nineteen bodies of people possibly killed in these ancient earthquakes have been found during excavations at the devastated Late Bronze Age cities. At Mycenae, for example, the skeletons of three adults and a child were found in the basement of a house two hundred meters north of the citadel, where they had been crushed beneath fallen stones during an earthquake. Similarly, in a house built on the west slope of the ridge north of the Treasury of Atreus, the skeleton of a middle-aged woman whose skull had been crushed by a falling stone was found in the doorway between the main room and the front room. At Tiryns, the skeletons of a woman and a child were found buried by the collapsed walls of Building X inside the Acropolis; two other human skeletons were found near the fortification walls, where they had been killed and then covered by debris falling from the walls. Similarly, at nearby Midea, other skeletons were found, including one of a young girl in a room near the East Gate, whose skull and backbone were smashed under fallen stones.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref344" href="Notes.html#_ftn344" title="344">[344]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">However, we must concede that although these earthquakes would have undoubtedly caused severe damage, it is unlikely that they alone were sufficient to cause a complete collapse of society, especially since some of the sites were clearly reoccupied and at least partially rebuilt afterward. Such was the case at Mycenae and Tiryns, for example, although they never again functioned at the level that they had achieved prior to the destruction. Thus, we must look elsewhere for a different, or perhaps complementary, explanation for the end of the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_66">Internal Rebellion</h3>

  <p class="normal">Some scholars have suggested that internal rebellions and social in equality may have contributed to the turmoil at the end of the Late Bronze Age, including at sites on the Greek mainland, such as Mycenae.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref345" href="Notes.html#_ftn345" title="345">[345]</a></sup></span> Such revolts could have been triggered by famine, whether caused by drought or otherwise, or earthquakes or other natural disasters, or even a cutting of the international trade routes, any and all of which could have dramatically impacted the economy in the affected areas and led dissatisfied peasants or lower classes to rebel against the ruling class, in a revolution akin to that in 1917 czarist Russia.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref346" href="Notes.html#_ftn346" title="346">[346]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Such a scenario might be invoked to explain the destruction seen, for instance, at Hazor in Canaan, where there is no evidence for an earthquake, nor is there specific evidence for warfare or invaders. Although Yigael Yadin and Amnon Ben-Tor, two of the primary excavators of the site, have both suggested a destruction by warfare, probably at the hands of the Israelites, the other codirector of the current excavations, Sharon Zuckerman of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, proposed that the destruction of Hazor Stratum IA, dating somewhere between 1230 and the early decades of the twelfth century BC, was caused by an internal rebellion of the city’s inhabitants, rather than an invasion by external peoples. As she stated, «there is no archaeological evidence of warfare, such as human victims or weapons, anywhere in the site... the view of the final destruction of the LBA city of Hazor as a sudden unexpected attack on a strong flourishing kingdom does not concur with the archaeological evidence.” She suggested instead that “mounting internal conflicts and gradual decline, culminating in the final assault on the major political and religious foci of the city’s elite, provides the most plausible alternative framework for the explanation of the destruction and abandonment of Hazor.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref347" href="Notes.html#_ftn347" title="347">[347]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Although there is no doubting the destructions observable at the various Mycenaean palatial centers and Canaanite cities, there is, quite frankly, no way to tell whether revolting peasants were responsible. It thus remains a plausible, but unproven, hypothesis. And again, many civilizations have successfully survived internal rebellions, often even flourishing under a new regime. Thus, on its own, the hypothesis of internal rebellions is not enough to account for the collapse of the Late Bronze Age civilizations in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_67">(Possible) Invaders and the Collapse<br/>of International Trade</h3>

  <p class="normal">Among events that could have led to an internal rebellion, we have just glimpsed the specter of outside invaders cutting the international trade routes and upsetting fragile economies that might have been overly dependent upon foreign raw materials. Carol Bell’s comparison of the strategic importance of tin in the Bronze Age to that of crude oil in today’s world might be particularly apt in this hypothetical situation.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref348" href="Notes.html#_ftn348" title="348">[348]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">However, even if an internal rebellion were not the outcome, the cutting of the trade routes could have had a severe, and immediate, impact upon Mycenaean kingdoms such as Pylos, Tiryns, and Mycenae, which needed to import both the copper and the tin needed to produce bronze, and which seem to have imported substantial quantities of additional raw materials as well, including gold, ivory, glass, ebony wood, and the terebinth resin used in making perfume. While natural disasters such as earthquakes could cause a temporary disruption in trade, potentially leading to higher prices and perhaps to what we today would call inflation, more permanent disruptions would more likely have been the result of outside invaders targeting the affected areas. However, who would these invaders have been? Or is this where we invoke the Sea Peoples?</p>

  <p class="normal">Rather than the Sea Peoples, the ancient Greeks— ranging from historians like Herodotus and Thucydides in fifth-century BC Athens to the much-later traveler Pausanias— believed that a group known as the Dorians had invaded from the north at the end of the Bronze Age, thereby initiating the Iron Age. This concept was once much discussed by archaeologists and ancient historians of the Bronze Age Aegean; among their considerations was a new type of pottery called “Handmade Burnished Ware” or “Barbarian Ware.” However, in recent decades it has become clear that there was no such invasion from the north at this time and no reason to accept the idea of a “Dorian Invasion” bringing the Mycenaean civilization to an end. Despite the traditions of the later classical Greeks, it is clear that the Dorians had nothing to do with the Collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age and entered Greece only long after those events had transpired. <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref349" href="Notes.html#_ftn349" title="349">[349]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Moreover, recent studies now indicate that even during the decline of the Mycenaean world and the early years of the succeeding Iron Age, mainland Greece may still have retained its trade connections to the Eastern Mediterranean. These connections, however, were probably no longer under the control of the elite classes who had dwelt in the Bronze Age palaces.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref350" href="Notes.html#_ftn350" title="350">[350]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In northern Syria, on the other hand, we have several documents attesting to the fact that maritime invaders attacked Ugarit during this time period, as we have seen above. Although we have little firm evidence for the origins of these marauders, we cannot dismiss the possibility that they included the Sea Peoples. In addition, scholars have recently pointed out that many of the city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean, and Ugarit in particular, may have been hard-hit by the collapse of the international trade routes, which would have been vulnerable to depredations by maritime marauders.</p>

  <p class="normal">Itamar Singer, for instance, has suggested that Ugarit’s downfall may have been due to “the sudden collapse of the traditional structures of international trade, which were the lifeblood of Ugarit’s booming economy in the Bronze Age.” Christopher Monroe of Cornell University has put this into a larger context, pointing out that the wealthiest city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean were the hardest-hit by the events taking place during the twelfth century BC, since they were not only the most attractive targets for the invaders but also the most dependent on the international trade network. He suggests that dependence, or perhaps overdependence, on capitalist enterprise, and specifically long-distance trade, may have contributed to the economic instability seen at the end of the Late Bronze Age.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref351" href="Notes.html#_ftn351" title="351">[351]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">However, we should not overlook the fact that Ugarit would have been a tempting target for both external invaders and homegrown pirates, as well as other possible groups. In this regard, we should recall the recently published letter from the House of Urtenu mentioned in chapter 4, which records that Ras Ibn Hani had just been overrun and Ugarit was now being threatened. We should also consider again the letter from the Southern Archive, found in Court V of the palace in Ugarit (but not within a kiln), which mentions seven enemy ships that had been causing havoc in the Ugaritic lands. whether or not these particular ships had anything to do with the final destruction of Ugarit, such enemy ships would have disrupted the international trade upon which Ugarit was vitally dependent.</p>

  <p class="normal">When such dramatic situations occur today, it seems that everyone has a piece of advice to give. Things were no different back then, during the Late Bronze Age. One letter found at Ugarit, possibly sent by the Hittite viceroy of Carchemish, gives the Ugaritic king advice on how to deal with such enemy ships. He begins, “You have written to me: ‘Ships of the enemy have been seen at sea!’” and then advises: “Well, you must remain firm. Indeed, for your part, where are your troops, your chariots stationed? Are they not stationed near you?... surround your cities with walls. Bring (your) infantry and chariotry into (them). Be on the lookout for the enemy and make yourself very strong!”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref352" href="Notes.html#_ftn352" title="352">[352]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Another letter, found in the House of Rapanu and sent by a man named Eshuwara who was the senior governor of Cyprus, is undoubtedly related. In this letter, the governor says that he is not responsible for any damage done to Ugarit or its territory by the ships, especially since it is—he claims— Ugarit’s own ships and men who are committing the atrocities, and that Ugarit should be prepared to defend itself: “As for the matter concerning those enemies: (it was) the people from your country (and) your own ships (who) did this! And (it was) the people from your country (who) committed these transgressions(s)... I am writing to inform you and protect you. Be aware!” He then adds that there are twenty enemy ships, but that they have gone off in an unknown direction.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref353" href="Notes.html#_ftn353" title="353">[353]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, a letter in the Urtenu archive from an official in Carchemish, located in inland northern Syria, states that the king of Carchemish was on his way from Hittite territory to Ugarit with reinforcements, and that the various people named in the letter, including Urtenu and the city elders, should try to hold out until they arrived.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref354" href="Notes.html#_ftn354" title="354">[354]</a></sup></span> It is unlikely that they arrived in time. If they did, they were of little use, for an additional, private letter at Ugarit, usually thought to be one of the last communications from this period, describes an alarming situation: “When your messenger arrived, the army was humiliated and the city was sacked. Our food in the threshing floors was burnt and the vineyards were also destroyed. Our city is sacked. May you know it! May you know it!”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref355" href="Notes.html#_ftn355" title="355">[355]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">As noted above, the excavators of Ugarit report that the city was burned, with a destruction level reaching two meters high in some places, and thatnnumerous arrowheads were found scattered throughout the ruins. There were also a number of hoards found buried in the city; some contained precious gold and bronze items, including figurines, weapons, and tools, some of them inscribed. All appear to have been items hidden just before the destruction took place; their owners never returned to retrieve them.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref356" href="Notes.html#_ftn356" title="356">[356]</a></sup></span> However, even a severe and complete destruction of the city does not explain why the survivors did not rebuild, unless there were no survivors.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rather than complete annihilation, it may be the cutting of the trade routes, and the collapse of the international trading system as a whole, that are the most logical and complete explanations as to why Ugarit was never reoccupied after its destruction. In the words of one scholar, “The fact that Ugarit never rose from its ashes, as did other LBA cities of the Levant which suffered a similar fate, must have more substantial grounds than the destruction inflicted upon the city.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref357" href="Notes.html#_ftn357" title="357">[357]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">However, there is a counterargument to this suggestion. Ugarit’s international connections apparently continued right up until the sudden end of the city, for there is a letter from the king of Beirut sent to an Ugaritic official (the prefect) that arrived after the king of Ugarit had already fled the city.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref358" href="Notes.html#_ftn358" title="358">[358]</a></sup></span> In other words, Ugarit was finally destroyed by invaders and was never rebuilt, despite the fact that the international trade connections were at least partially if not still completely intact at the time of destruction.</p>

  <p class="normal">In fact, what jumps out from the materials in the Rapanu and Urtenu archives is the tremendous amount of international interconnection that apparently still existed in the Eastern Mediterranean even at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Moreover, it is clear from the few texts published from the Urtenu archive that these international connections continued right up until almost the last moment before Ugarit’s destruction. This seems to be a clear indication that the end was probably sudden, rather than a gradual decline after trade routes had been cut or because of drought and famine, and that Ugarit specifically was destroyed by invaders, regardless of whether these forces had also cut the international trade routes.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_68">Decentralization and the Rise <br/>of the Private Merchant</h3>

  <p class="normal">There is one other point to be considered, which has been suggested relatively recently and may well be a reflection of current thinking about the role of decentralization in today’s world.</p>

  <p class="normal">In an article published in 1998, Susan Sherratt, now at the University of Sheffield, concluded that the Sea Peoples represent the final step in the replacement of the old centralized politico-economic systems pre sent in the Bronze Age with the new decentralized economic systems of the Iron Age— that is, the change from kingdoms and empires that controlled the international trade to smaller city-states and individual entrepreneurs who were in business for themselves. She suggested that the Sea Peoples can “usefully be seen as a structural phenomenon, a product of the natural evolution and expansion of international trade in the 3rd and early 2nd millennium, which carried within it the seeds of the subversion of the palace-based command economies which had initiated such trade in the first place.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref359" href="Notes.html#_ftn359" title="359">[359]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Thus, while she concedes that the international trade routes might have collapsed, and that at least some of the Sea Peoples may have been migratory invaders, she ultimately concludes that it does not really matter where the Sea Peoples came from, or even who they were or what they did. Far more important is the sociopolitical and economic change that they represent, from a predominantly palatial-controlled economy to one in which private merchants and smaller entities had considerably more economic freedom.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref360" href="Notes.html#_ftn360" title="360">[360]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Although Sherratt’s argument is elegantly stated, other scholars had earlier made similar suggestions. For example, Klaus Kilian, excavator of Tiryns, once wrote: «After the fall of the Mycenaean palaces, when ‘private’ economy had been established in Greece, contacts continued with foreign countries. The well-organized palatial system was succeeded by smaller local reigns, certainly less powerful in their economic expansion.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref361" href="Notes.html#_ftn361" title="361">[361]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Michal Artzy, of the University of Haifa, even gave a name to some of the private merchants envisioned by Sherratt, dubbing them “Nomads of the Sea.” She suggested that they had been active as intermediaries who carried out much of the maritime trade during the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries BC.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref362" href="Notes.html#_ftn362" title="362">[362]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">However, more recent studies have taken issue with the type of transitional worldview proposed by Sherratt. Carol Bell, for instance, respectfully disagrees, saying: “It is simplistic... to view the change between the LBA and the Iron Age as the replacement of palace administered exchange with entrepreneurial trade. A wholesale replacement of one paradigm for another is not a good explanation for this change and restructuring.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref363" href="Notes.html#_ftn363" title="363">[363]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">While there is no question that privatization may have begun as a by-product of palatial trade, it is not at all clear that this privatization then ultimately undermined the very economy from which it had come. At Ugarit, for example, scholars have pointed out that even though the city was clearly burned and abandoned, there is no evidence either in the texts found at the site or in the remains themselves that the destruction and collapse had been caused by decentralized entrepreneurs undermining the state and its control of international trade.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref364" href="Notes.html#_ftn364" title="364">[364]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In fact, combining textual observations with the fact that Ugarit was clearly destroyed by fire, and that there are weapons in the debris, we may safely reiterate that although there may have been the seeds of decentralization at Ugarit, warfare and fighting almost certainly caused the final destruction, with external invaders as the likely culprits. This is a far differ ent scenario from that envisioned by Sherratt and her like-minded colleagues. whether these invaders were the Sea Peoples is uncertain, however, although it is intriguing that one of the texts at Ugarit specifically mentions the Shikila/Shekelesh, known from the Sea Peoples inscriptions of Merneptah and Ramses III.</p>

  <p class="normal">In any event, even if decentralization and private individual merchants were an issue, it seems unlikely that they caused the collapse of the Late Bronze Age, at least on their own. Instead of accepting the idea that private merchants and their enterprises undermined the Bronze Age economy, perhaps we should consider the alternative suggestion that they simply emerged out of the chaos of the Collapse, as was suggested by James Muhly of the University of Pennsylvania. He saw the twelfth century BC not as a world dominated by “sea raiders, pirates, and freebooting mercenaries,” but rather as a world of “enterprising merchants and traders, exploiting new economic opportunities, new markets, and new sources of raw materials.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref365" href="Notes.html#_ftn365" title="365">[365]</a></sup></span> Out of chaos comes opportunity, at least for a lucky few, as always.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_69">Was It the Sea Peoples and Where Did They Go?</h3>

  <p class="normal">We come, finally, to a more prolonged consideration of the migrations of the Sea Peoples, who remain as enigmatic and elusive as ever. Whether they are seen as pirates, sea raiders, or migrating populations, the archaeological and textual evidence both indicate that the Sea Peoples, despite their moniker, most likely traveled both by land and by sea— that is, by any means possible.</p>

  <p class="normal">Those proceeding by sea would most likely have hugged the coastline, perhaps even putting in to a safe harbor e very evening. However, questions remain as to whether the enemy ships mentioned in the Ugaritic texts belonged to the Sea Peoples or to renegade members of their own kingdom, as implied in the letter sent by Eshuwara, the governor of Alashiya. In this regard, we should take into account the letter just mentioned, from the House of Urtenu in Ugarit, that mentions the “Shikila people,” who, more likely than not, can be identified with the Shekelesh of the Egyptian records. The letter was sent by the Hittite king, probably Suppiluliuma II, to the governor of Ugarit, and refers to a young king of Ugarit, who “does not know anything.” Singer, among other scholars, sees this as a probable reference to Ammurapi, who was the new king of Ugarit at the time. In the letter, the Hittite king says that he wishes to interview a man named Ibnadushu, who had been captured by the Shikila people “who live on ships,” in order to find out more information about these Shikila/Shekelesh. However, we do not know whether the interview ever took place or what else might have been learned from Ibnadushu.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref366" href="Notes.html#_ftn366" title="366">[366]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">It is generally agreed that this document contains the only specific mention by name of the Sea Peoples outside of Egyptian records, although it has also been suggested that there might be others. The «enemy from the land of Alashiya” who attacked the last Hittite king, Suppiluliuma II, on land after he had fought three sea battles against Alashiyan (i.e., Cypriot) forces is possibly a reference to the Sea Peoples. So too is an inscription found at Hattusa in 1988, which may contain an indication that Suppiluliuma II was already fighting the Sea Peoples who had landed on the southern coast of Anatolia and were advancing north.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref367" href="Notes.html#_ftn367" title="367">[367]</a></sup></span> Most documents and inscriptions, other than the Egyptian records, simply contain the more general phrase «enemy ships,” though, and do not specifically name the Sea Peoples.</p>

  <p class="normal">Those of the Sea Peoples who came by land possibly, and perhaps likely, proceeded along a predominantly coastal route, where the destruction of specific cities would have opened up entire new areas to them, in much the same way that Alexander the great’s battles at the Granicus River, Issus, and Gaugamela opened up specific portions of the ancient Near East to his army almost a thousand years later. Assaf Yasur-Landau of the University of Haifa has suggested that some of the Sea Peoples could have begun their journey in Greece and passed through the Dardanelles to western Turkey/Anatolia. Others— perhaps most of them, he says— would simply have begun their journey at this point, perhaps joining those coming from the Aegean, with the route continuing along the southern coast of Turkey to Cilicia at its eastern end, and then down to the southern Levant via a route running along the coast. If they followed this route, they would have encountered the city of Troy, the kingdoms of Arzawa and Tarhuntassa in Anatolia, and the cities of Tarsus and Ugarit in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria, respectively. Some or all of these sites do show signs of destruction and/or subsequent abandonment that occurred about the time that the Sea Peoples are presumed to have been active, but it is unclear whether they were actually responsible.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref368" href="Notes.html#_ftn368" title="368">[368]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In fact, the archaeological evidence now seems to suggest that most of the sites in Anatolia were simply either completely or mostly abandoned at this time, rather than put to the torch by the Sea Peoples. We can speculate that if the international trade, transportation, and communication routes were disrupted by wars, famines, or other forces, the cities dependent upon these routes might have withered and died, with the result that their populations would have left gradually or fled rapidly, depending upon the speed of commercial and cultural decline. As one scholar has recently said, “while it is reasonable to assume that Cilicia and the Syrian coast were affected by the actions of the Sea Peoples, so far neither historical nor archaeological evidence for any kind of activity of the Sea Peoples in the Hittite homelands is attested... the real causes for the collapse of the Hittite state seem to be internal rather than external.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref369" href="Notes.html#_ftn369" title="369">[369]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">A prime example of assigning blame without proof is the claim related to the radiocarbon dating at Tell Tweini, the site of the Late Bronze Age harbor town of Gibala within the kingdom of Ugarit. Here, the laboratory results initially led the excavators and their colleagues to conclude that they had found evidence of destruction wreaked by the Sea Peoples, and to specifically date it to 1192–1190 BC, though, as noted, Knapp and Manning stress that this dating is overly precise. The excavators originally stated, without caveat: “The Sea Peoples were seaborne foes from different origins. They launched a combined land-sea invasion that destabilized the already weakened power base of empires and kingdoms of the old world, and attempted to enter or control the Egyptian territory. The Sea Peoples symbolize the last step of a long and complex spiral of decline in the ancient Mediterranean world.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref370" href="Notes.html#_ftn370" title="370">[370]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Although there is little doubt that the city was destroyed at about the time identified by the excavators, as confirmed by the radiocarbon dates, the attribution to the Sea Peoples as the agents of the destruction is speculative, although it is certainly quite possible that they were the culprits. The excavators did not offer any definitive proof regarding a role for the Sea Peoples; they simply point out that the material culture of the settlement that was established on the tell after the destruction includes “the appearance of Aegean-type architecture, locally-made Mycenaean IIIC Early pottery, hand-made burnished pottery, and Aegean-type loom-weights.” As they state, «these materials, also known from Philistine settlements, are cultural markers of foreign settlers, most probably the Sea Peoples.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref371" href="Notes.html#_ftn371" title="371">[371]</a></sup></span> While Tweini could be the best example yet of a site possibly destroyed and then resettled by the Sea Peoples, we cannot say so with absolute certainty. In fact, subsequent publications by the excavators and associated scientists have acknowledged that fact; Kaniewski and his team now describe the site’s destruction as having been wrought “most probably (but not certainly) by Sea Peoples.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref372" href="Notes.html#_ftn372" title="372">[372]</a></sup></span> Moreover, as Annie Caubet has noted with regard to Ras Ibn Hani (above), one cannot always be sure that the people who resettled a site after its destruction are necessarily the same ones who destroyed it in the first place.</p>

  <p class="normal">We can further speculate that in at least some cases groups designated as the Sea Peoples might have entered the vacuum created by the destruction and/or abandonment of the cities, whether caused by themselves or by Others, and settled down without moving on, eventually leaving their artifacts behind them, as may have been the case at Tweini. In such circumstances, these Sea Peoples are likely to have occupied primarily, although not exclusively, the coastal cities, including sites like Tarsin and Mersin on the coast of southeastern Anatolia. The same may be true for the region now on the border between southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, in the area of Tell Ta’yinat, which recent evidence suggests became known as the “Land of Palistin” during the Iron Age.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref373" href="Notes.html#_ftn373" title="373">[373]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In fact, there are traditions, especially literary traditions, which specifically state that the Sea Peoples settled Tel Dor, in the north of what is now modern Israel. For example, the Egyptian story called “The Report of Wenamun,” which dates to the first half of the eleventh century BC, refers to Dor as a town of the Tjekker or Sikils (Shekelesh). Another Egyptian text, the “Onomasticon of Amenemope,” which dates to ca. 1100 BC, lists the Shardana, the Tjekker, and the Peleset, and also mentions the sites of Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Gaza (three of the five sites considered to be part of the Philistine “pentapolis”).</p>

  <p class="normal">Sites along the Carmel Coast and in the Akko Valley, as well as perhaps Tel Dan, have also been suggested as having been settled by the Sea Peoples, such as the Shardana and the Danuna. At many of these sites, including those with occupation levels designated as “Philistine,” such as at Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and elsewhere, degenerate Aegean-style pottery and other cultural identifiers have been found.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref374" href="Notes.html#_ftn374" title="374">[374]</a></sup></span> These may well be the only physical remains that we have of the elusive Sea Peoples, particularly given the new DNA data from Ashkelon, which we will discuss in a moment. However, apart from Ashkelon, the archaeological remains at many of these sites, and even farther north, seem to have more direct connections with Cyprus than with the Aegean. Nevertheless, there are clear links to non-Canaanite Peoples in the twelfth century BC.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref375" href="Notes.html#_ftn375" title="375">[375]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Interestingly, there seem to be no such remains, nor any such destruction, in the area that came to be known as Phoenicia, primarily in what is now modern Lebanon. Despite scholarly discussions, it is still unclear why this should be so, or whether it is simply an illusion caused by the relative lack of excavation here, compared to the other coastal regions of the Near East.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref376" href="Notes.html#_ftn376" title="376">[376]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Among the many scenarios suggested to explain the final days of the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, the proposal made by Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University two decades ago still seems most likely. He argues that the migration of the Sea Peoples was not a single event but a long pro cess involving several phases, with the first phase starting in the early years of Ramses III, ca. 1177 BC, and the last phase ending during the time of Ramses VI, ca. 1130 BC. He says specifically that</p>

  <p class="quote">despite the description in the Egyptian texts of a single event, the migration of the Sea Peoples was at least a half-century-long process that had several phases... It may have started with groups that spread destruction along the Levantine coast, including northern Philistia, in the beginning of the twelfth century and that were defeated by Ramesses III in his eighth year. Consequently, some of them were settled in Egyptian garrisons in the delta. Later groups of Sea Peoples, in the second half of the twelfth century, succeeded in terminating Egyptian rule in southern Canaan. After destroying the Egyptian strongholds... they settled in Philistia and established their major centers at Ashdod, Ashkelon, Tel Miqne, and other places. These people— the Philistines of the later biblical text— are easily identifiable by several Aegean-derived features in their material culture.<sup><a id="_ftnref377" href="Notes.html#_ftn377" title="377">[377]</a></sup></p>

  <p class="normal">While Finkelstein may well be correct, it is likely that the process had begun at least three decades earlier and thus lasted even longer. Recall that the first recorded battle took place in 1207 BC, during the reign of Merneptah. That would mean we are looking at more than three-quarters of a century with successive waves of newcomers, whether peaceful immigrants fleeing from their original homes, hostile military forces intent on conquest, or a combination of the two.</p>

  <p class="normal">Most scholars agree with Finkelstein that the archaeological evidence seems to indicate that we should be looking primarily at the Aegean region, perhaps via the filter of western Anatolia and Cyprus as intermediate stops for some or most along the way, rather than Sicily, Sardinia, and the Western Mediterranean for the origin of many of the Sea Peoples.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref378" href="Notes.html#_ftn378" title="378">[378]</a></sup></span> However, Yasur-Landau suggests that if they were Mycenaeans, they were not those fleeing the ruins of their palaces, at Mycenae and elsewhere, just after those places were destroyed. He points out that there is no evidence of Linear B writing or other aspects of the wealthy palatial period from the thirteenth century BC on the Greek mainland at these Anatolian and Canaanite sites. Rather, the material culture of these settlers indicates that they were from “the rather humbler culture that came [immediately] afterward” during the early twelfth century BC. He also notes that some may even have been farmers rather than raiding warriors, looking to improve their lives by moving to a new area. Regardless, they were “an entire population of families on the move to a new home.” In any event, he believes that these mi grants were not the cause of the collapse of the Late Bronze Age civilizations in this area but were instead “opportunists” who took advantage of the Collapse to find themselves new homes.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref379" href="Notes.html#_ftn379" title="379">[379]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Yasur-Landau also takes issue with the traditional picture of a Philistine military takeover of Canaan. He says: “The circumstances of the settlement do not reflect a violent incursion. Recent discoveries at Ashkelon show that the mi grants [actually] settled on a deserted site, on top of the unfinished remains of an Egyptian garrison... There are no clear signs for any violent destruction at Ashdod... the signs of destruction described by the excavators [ there] may be no more than evidence for cooking... At Ekron, the small Canaanite village... was indeed destroyed by fire, but... [was] replaced by another Canaanite village... before the arrival of the migrants.” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref380" href="Notes.html#_ftn380" title="380">[380]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Rather than a hostile military-style takeover, Yasur-Landau sees instead intercultural marriages and intercultural families, maintaining both Canaanite and Aegean traditions, mostly in the domestic arena. As he puts it, “material remains from early Iron Age Philistia reveal intricate, and predominantly peaceful, interactions between mi grants and locals... I would therefore venture to suggest that the general lack of violence connected with the foundation of the Philistine cities... and the co-existence of both Aegean and local cultural traditions indicate that these were joint foundations of Aegean mi grants and local populations, rather than colonial enterprises.” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref381" href="Notes.html#_ftn381" title="381">[381]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Other scholars agree, pointing out that, at most, the Philistines destroyed only the elite portions at some of the sites— the palace and its environs, for instance— and that the components that we now identify with the Philistines were “of a mixed nature and include features from the Aegean, Cyprus, Anatolia, Southeast Eu rope and beyond.” It does not appear that completely foreign elements simply replaced the previous Canaanite material culture lock, stock, and barrel (in terms of pottery, building practices, and so on); rather, what we now identify as Philistine culture may be the result of a hybridization and a mingling of different cultures, containing both the older local Canaanite and newer foreign intrusive elements.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref382" href="Notes.html#_ftn382" title="382">[382]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">We can now elaborate upon the new DNA evidence from Ashkelon that was referenced briefly above. It comes from the remains of four infants, buried under the floors of Philistine houses in Ashkelon during the late twelfth century BC. They cannot themselves have been part of the original waves of invaders ca. 1207 and 1177 BC, since they would not yet have been born, but are instead from a generation or two later.</p>

  <p class="normal">The DNA was recovered from the inner ear (i.e., the petrous bone) of the infants; along with teeth, this is the location that most often yields good traces of ancient DNA. It turns out that all four infants have mixed DNA, with somewhere between one-quarter and more than one-half (43.1 ± 19.2%) identifiable as “southern Eu ro pean,” reflecting ancestors who had come most likely from Bronze Age Crete or, less likely, from Sardinia or Spain, according to the geneticists. The remainder of the infants’ DNA matched the local population, meaning that the Canaanites “had quickly mated with their new neighbors.” Thus, these infants appear to be the direct descendants of Philistines who had initially migrated to, and then assimilated with, the local Canaanites.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref383" href="Notes.html#_ftn383" title="383">[383]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">There has been some pushback from other archaeologists, who have argued that the number of skeletons that yielded the relevant DNA at Ashkelon is too small a sample to sustain the claims that were made. However, I believe that both the data and the conclusions are correct, but also agree that we need more samples and more testing done before we can be fully confident of those conclusions. The scenario of assimilation and subsequent intercultural families was exactly what was proposed by Yasur-Landau in 2010. These new findings support his hypotheses. “This is about real people who are moving from real troubles, finding new families in a new home,” he said when the news was first announced.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref384" href="Notes.html#_ftn384" title="384">[384]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Conducting DNA analysis on skeletons retrieved from archaeological excavations has become increasingly common as a consequence of technological advances in extracting and sequencing ancient DNA. Although we must be cautious about overinterpreting the results, one group of researchers has described it as providing “a powerful new tool for the investigation of past populations and migrations.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref385" href="Notes.html#_ftn385" title="385">[385]</a></sup></span> The application of such advances in DNA research is part of the new wave in archaeology which utilizes science in order to help answer questions that have been unresolvable by other means. For more than a century, we have debated the question of where the Philistines came from. Now we may have a preliminary answer via genetic analysis, which is believable and dovetails nicely with other data based on material remains such as pottery that have been found by archaeologists working in the Levant.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, although there is little question that there were new Peoples entering and settling down in Canaan at this time, in this reconstruction the bogeyman specter of the invading Sea Peoples/Philistines has been replaced by a somewhat more peaceful picture of a mixed group of migrants in search of a new start in a new land, who apparently also brought with them a new type of pig and several new species of plants.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref386" href="Notes.html#_ftn386" title="386">[386]</a></sup></span> Rather than simply being militant invaders intent only on destruction, they were more likely to have also included refugees who did not necessarily always attack and conquer the local Peoples but frequently simply settled down among them. In short, they are unlikely, all by themselves, to have ended civilization in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref387" href="Notes.html#_ftn387" title="387">[387]</a></sup></span></p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_70">Disease</h3>

  <p class="normal">We should also consider disease at this point, as another potential stressor or driver. It has been argued that Ramses V, a young king who ruled Egypt for only a few years ca. 1140 BC, suffered from smallpox, as did several members of his immediate family. His mummy bears witness to this, with pustules still visible on his face. Although it is not clear whether the smallpox caused their deaths, a related discussion in Turin Papyrus No. 1923 mentions that he and the others were not buried until fully sixteen months after they died (much longer than the usual seventy days or so), and only after new tombs had been dug just for them, which seems suspicious.</p>

  <p class="normal">Additionally, the men who finally buried them were given a month’s leave “at the expense of the Pharaoh” immediately afterward, and the Valley of the Kings was apparently closed to visitors for six months; this may have been the world’s first textually attested quarantine.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref388" href="Notes.html#_ftn388" title="388">[388]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Philip Norrie, a physician in Australia, has recently discussed this case and has speculated as well on the possibility of some ten different diseases that theoretically could be implicated in the Bronze Age Collapse, including smallpox, dysentery, bubonic plague, typhoid, malaria, and tularemia (rabbit fever).<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref389" href="Notes.html#_ftn389" title="389">[389]</a></sup></span> However, there is no indication yet that there was a widespread epidemic of smallpox or any other sort of disease at the time, for no mass graves have been found, and there is little other evidence that might be used as proof of yet another calamity in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean thirty-two hundred years ago.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course, after such an extended period of time, it may be exceedingly difficult to find objective evidence, since it can be very hard to identify a pandemic disease in antiquity from the archaeological record alone. In most cases, we rely primarily on textual evidence, such as for the plague in Periclean Athens during the fifth century BC and those in the Roman Empire during the first millennium AD.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref390" href="Notes.html#_ftn390" title="390">[390]</a></sup></span> However, unless one counts Homer’s mention of a plague striking the Mycenaean troops at Troy and the biblical account of the deaths of the firstborn sons at the time of the Exodus, there are few mentions in the Late Bronze Age texts that could be interpreted as related to disease.</p>

  <p class="normal">The closest that we get are the literary references to the outbreak of plague that was brought back to the Hittite homelands 150 years earlier, in the fourteenth century BC, courtesy of Egyptian prisoners of war. That plague, which we have already discussed, killed King Suppiluliuma I and many in the Hittite royal family, as well as much of the general population.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref391" href="Notes.html#_ftn391" title="391">[391]</a></sup></span> Intriguingly, Trevor Bryce, an Australian scholar whose specialty is the Hittites, has recently hypothesized that the possible evacuation of the Hittite capital city, Hattusa, prior to its final destruction ca. 1200 BC could have been the result of a renewed outbreak of the plague, in addition to the famine from which they were already suffering at that time.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref392" href="Notes.html#_ftn392" title="392">[392]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Although Bryce’s suggestion is not supported by any existing evidence, it is not out of the question that disease could go hand in hand with everything else that was happening in this period, as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death). Thus, although we do not have anything conclusive yet, I will not be the least bit surprised if an archaeologist or epigrapher eventually finds further archaeological or textual evidence that there was disease or an epidemic of some sort as yet another stressor leading to the Bronze Age Collapse. If additional skeletal remains from this period are uncovered, it should be possible to apply the same techniques of DNA extraction and analysis of skeletal remains that were used to identify the intermixing of ethnic groups to look for evidence of the DNA of pathogenic microorganisms such as <i>Yersinia pestsis</i> or <i>Rickettsia typhi</i> that could have caused widespread plague. Each organism has its own distinctive gen e tic footprint, and, as we have seen, some DNA fragments can remain stable over millennia in teeth and bones.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_71">Climate Change, Drought, and Famine</h3>

  <p class="normal">There is also something else that we haven’t yet considered, which is the proverbial eight-hundred-pound gorilla (or elephant) in the room, especially given our own current concerns about the impact of climate change on today’s world. One suggestion favored by scholars, especially those seeking to explain not only the end of the Late Bronze Age but also why the Sea Peoples may have begun their migrations, is that there was climate change back then, manifested in the form of drought, which resulted in famine. Although hypotheses formulated by archaeologists frequently reflect the era, de cade, or even the year in which they are publishing, such musings regarding the effects of possible climate change at the end of the second millennium BC predate by several decades our current preoccupation with climate change.</p>

  <p class="normal">For example, drought was long the favored explanation of earlier scholars for the movement of the Sea Peoples out of the regions of the Western Mediterranean and into the lands to the east. They postulated that a drought in northern Eu rope had pressured the population to migrate down into the Mediterranean region, where they displaced the inhabitants of Sicily, Sardinia, and Italy, and perhaps those in the Aegean as well. If this occurred, it might have initiated a chain reaction that culminated in the movement of peoples far away in the Eastern Mediterranean. One need only look at the infamous “Dust Bowl” of the 1930s in the United States to find a recent example of a drought initiating large-scale human migrations, in this case mainly from Midwestern states, such as Oklahoma and Arkansas, to California.</p>

  <p class="normal">It now seems that such a disastrous drought may have affected northern Italy in the Bronze Age. There are indications that the Terramare culture, which had flourished in the Po delta/plain in northern Italy since the seventeenth century BC, suddenly collapsed around 1200 BC. Kristian Kristiansen, a highly regarded scholar of Bronze Age Europe, notes that a massive migration seems to have taken place at that time, involving up to 120,000 people who left “in several huge exoduses.” Why did they leave? Kristiansen cites a number of possible factors, including demographic pressure and competition for limited resources. Preserved pollen remains indicate “increasing signs of crisis and overexploitation” of the environment from 1300 BC. Evidence of warfare, including skeletons showing wounds from axes, swords, and arrowheads, adds to the complex mix of influential factors. Finally, a drought may have hit about 1200 BC. Faced with these pressures, the mi grants headed both south and west, to southern Italy and Sicily, and also to the Aegean and possibly beyond.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref393" href="Notes.html#_ftn393" title="393">[393]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">This type of migration is frequently referred to as “push-pull,” with negative conditions in the home area pushing the inhabitants out and positive conditions in the area of destination beckoning or pulling the new mi grants in that direction. To these, as the British archaeologist Guy Middleton has pointed out, may be added the categories of “stay” and “ability”: the factors contributing to the desire to stay at home after all, and the factors regarding the ability to actually migrate, including knowledge of sailing, passable routes, and so on.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref394" href="Notes.html#_ftn394" title="394">[394]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Perhaps the most famous of the arguments in favor of a drought as an influential factor in the demise of the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean was suggested more than fifty years ago, in the mid-1960s, by Rhys Carpenter, a professor of archaeology at Bryn Mawr College. He published a very short but extremely influential book in which he argued that the Mycenaean civilization had been brought down by a prolonged drought that had severely affected the Mediterranean and Aegean regions. He based his arguments in part on what appeared to be a rather dramatic drop in population on mainland Greece following the end of the Bronze Age.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref395" href="Notes.html#_ftn395" title="395">[395]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Carpenter’s ingenious suggestion subsequently fell by the wayside, primarily for lack of supporting evidence at the time. It now appears that he may have been correct, at least to a certain degree. A few scholars did eventually follow up on his ideas, especially Barry Weiss, who was working at Bell Laboratories in Denver, Colorado, at the time. His paper in 1982, suggesting that the devastation across the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean at the end of the Late Bronze Age had been climate induced, anticipated current studies by a good three decades, but he too seems to have been largely ignored until recently. This appears to have been accidental rather than deliberate, for his article was published in the journal <span class="italic">Climate Change</span>, which was a relatively new journal at the time, in the early 1980s, and few archaeologists would have known about it. Interestingly, he was advocating even back then for the potential usefulness of pollen analysis as a proxy for determining climate change back in the Bronze Age, an idea that has now come to fruition.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref396" href="Notes.html#_ftn396" title="396">[396]</a></sup></span> We shall return to this in a moment.</p>

  <p class="normal">If we turn briefly to the evidence for famine, we note that it can be difficult to find archaeological evidence for such deprivation, unless one uncovers skeletons or a mass burial. However, scholars have long pointed to written texts that speak plainly of famines and the need for grain in the Hittite Empire and elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean at the end of the Bronze Age. They have also correctly noted that the occurrence of famine in this region was not unique to the final years of the Late Bronze Age.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref397" href="Notes.html#_ftn397" title="397">[397]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">For example, decades earlier, during the mid-thirteenth century BC, a Hittite queen (referred to only as “Puduhepa”— which is literally the Hittite word for “queen” rather than her personal name) wrote to the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II, stating, “I have no grain in my lands.” Soon thereafter, probably in a related move, the Hittites sent a trade embassy to Egypt in order to procure barley and wheat for shipment back to Anatolia.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref398" href="Notes.html#_ftn398" title="398">[398]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">An inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah, in which he states that he had “caused grain to be taken in ships, to keep alive this land of Hatti,” further confirms that there was famine in the land of the Hittites toward the end of the thirteenth century BC and that a relief mission was sent by the Egyptians, just as today food is similarly often sent to areas in need.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref399" href="Notes.html#_ftn399" title="399">[399]</a></sup></span> Additional correspondence sent from the Hittite capital city attests to the ongoing crisis during the following decades, including one letter in which the writer rhetorically asks, “Do you not know that there was a famine in the midst of my lands?” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref400" href="Notes.html#_ftn400" title="400">[400]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Some of the letters found at Ugarit in northern Syria are also concerned with the transportation of large quantities of grain to the Hittites in Anatolia. One missive sent from the Hittite king to the king of Ugarit is concerned specifically with a shipment of two thousand units of grain (possibly as much as 450 tons). The Hittite king ends his letter dramatically, stating, “It is a matter of life or death!” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref401" href="Notes.html#_ftn401" title="401">[401]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Another letter is similarly concerned with the shipment of grain, but it also requests that many boats be sent as well. This led the original excavators of Ugarit to hypothesize that it was a reaction to the incursions of the Sea Peoples, which it may or may not have been.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref402" href="Notes.html#_ftn402" title="402">[402]</a></sup></span> Even the last king of Ugarit, Ammurapi, received several letters from the Hittite king Suppiluliuma II in the early twelfth century BC, including one chastising him for being late in sending a much-needed shipment of food to the Hittite homeland. That one was sent sometime in the years just before the final destructions of both the Hittite kingdom and Ugarit, and declared plaintively, “The Sun himself [i.e., the Hittite king] is perishing.” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref403" href="Notes.html#_ftn403" title="403">[403]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Itamar Singer of Tel Aviv University was convinced that the extent of famine during the last years of the thirteenth and the early decades of the twelfth century BC was unprecedented, and that it affected far more areas than simply Anatolia. In his estimation, the evidence, both textual and archaeological, indicates that “climatological cataclysms affected the entire eastern Mediterranean region towards the end of the second millennium BCE.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref404" href="Notes.html#_ftn404" title="404">[404]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Singer was undoubtedly correct, for one of the letters found in the House of Urtenu at Ugarit in northern Syria refers to a famine ravaging the city of Emar in inland Syria at the time that it was destroyed in 1185 BC. The letter was sent by someone named Banniya (or Eniya), who worked for Urtenu’s commercial firm but was stationed in a branch office located in Emar. The relevant lines contain a stark message: «There is famine in your [i.e., our] house; we will all die of hunger. If you do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger. You will not see a living soul from your land.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref405" href="Notes.html#_ftn405" title="405">[405]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Additional texts, including some published as recently as 2016, show that even Ugarit itself was affected by famine. One is a letter sent from the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah to the king of Ugarit, which was found in the House of Urtenu; it states explicitly that there was famine in the city. In the letter, the pharaoh cited an earlier letter and quoted the words of the Ugaritic king back to him: “So you had written to me: ‘. . . [In] the land of Ugarit there is a severe hunger: May my lord save [the land of Ugarit], and may the king give grain to save my life... and to save the citizens of the land of Ugarit.’” As Yoram Cohen, an Assyriologist at Tel Aviv University, has pointed out, in response to this plea from the Ugaritic king, the pharaoh sent gold objects, large amounts of textiles, and seven thousand dried fish (of various sorts).<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref406" href="Notes.html#_ftn406" title="406">[406]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">The chastising letter sent from the Hittite king Suppiluliuma II to Ammurapi of Ugarit near the end of the life of the city, cited above, similarly says, “You have sent a message... to the effect that there is no food in your land.” In another letter, an unnamed king of Ugarit wrote to an unidentified, but probably royal and senior, correspondent, saying bluntly, “(Here) with me, plenty (has become) famine,” while in yet another, an Ugaritic official said to the king of Ugarit, “Another thing, my lord: grain staples from you are not to be had! (The people of) the house hold of your servant will die of hunger! Give grain staples to your servant!”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref407" href="Notes.html#_ftn407" title="407">[407]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">There is also a text sent from the king of Tyre, located in the coastal area of what is now Lebanon, to the king of Ugarit. It informs the Ugaritic king that his ship, which was returning from Egypt loaded with grain, had been caught in a storm: “Your ship that you sent to Egypt, died [was wrecked] in a mighty storm close to Tyre. It was recovered and the salvage master [or captain] took all the grain from their jars. But I have taken all their grain, all their people, and all their belongings from the salvage master [or captain], and I have returned (it all) to them. And (now) your ship is being taken care of in Akko, stripped.” In other words, the ship had either sought refuge or been successfully salvaged. Either way, the crew and the grain it carried were safe and awaiting the command of the Ugaritic king.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref408" href="Notes.html#_ftn408" title="408">[408]</a></sup></span> The ship itself, it seems, was berthed in the port city of Akko, where today one can sit in a pleasant seaside restaurant and imagine the bustle of activities that took place there more than three thousand years ago.</p>

  <p class="normal">In short, it is clear that famine severely affected Ugarit in its final days. More than that, the city presents evidence of having been struck by virtually e very known calamity at the end of the Bronze Age, including being knocked about by an earthquake, then subsequently suffering from famine, and finally falling to invaders. If we pull together all of the textual and archaeological evidence that has been presented in bits and pieces above, we can create a probable “time line” for the final decades of Ugarit, although precise dates for the order of events are not possible:</p>

  <ol class="list_">
    <li class="para21">Ugarit happily interacts with foreign powers (e.g., trade with Egypt).</li>

    <li class="para21">Earthquake damages city, but does not destroy it.</li>

    <li class="para21">Ugarit sends aid relief (grain) to Hittites.</li>

    <li class="para21">Famine descends on city.</li>

    <li class="para21">Egypt sends aid relief (food, textiles, etc.).</li>

    <li class="para21">Enemy ships are spotted.</li>

    <li class="para21">Enemy overruns nearby Ras Ibn Hani and threatens Ugarit.</li>

    <li class="para21">City is destroyed in battle, leaving destruction debris two meters high. </li>

    <li class="para21">City is not reoccupied for centuries.</li>
  <br/></ol>

  <p class="normal">But what factor, or combinations of factors, may have caused the famine(s) in the Eastern Mediterranean during these decades remains uncertain. Elem ents that might be considered include war and plagues of insects, but climate change accompanied by drought is more likely to have turned a once-verdant land into an arid semidesert. Until recently, the Ugaritic and other Eastern Mediterranean textual documents containing reports of famine provided the only potential evidence for climate change or drought, and even that was indirect. As a result, the issue has been debated by scholars for decades. However, things have now changed.</p>

  <p class="normal">We return, therefore, to the topic of drought, which has recently been given new impetus as a result of additional findings published by scholars, working either individually or in teams in a number of different areas in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. Their research has involved investigating ancient pollen in Syria, Israel, Egypt, and Cyprus; isotopic signatures and other indicators from lake sediments in Turkey, Syria, and possibly Iran; oxygen isotope studies from stalagmites and mineral deposits within caves in Greece and Israel; and other relevant research.</p>

  <p class="normal">Taken as a whole, the evidence now points rather conclusively to a drought in the region that lasted at least 150 years and possibly 300 years, beginning about 1200 BC. It may be more accurate to call it a megadrought, which is defined as “a severe drought that occurs across a broad region for a long duration, typically multiple decades,” such as the one that has recently been identified in the western United States.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref409" href="Notes.html#_ftn409" title="409">[409]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Since the megadrought at the end of the Late Bronze Age began approximately 3,200 years ago, it is now commonly referred to in scientific literature as the “3.2 ka BP event,” in which “ka” stands for “kilo-annum” (as in “thousand years”) and “BP” stands for “Before Present.” It is also sometimes more simply called the “3.2ka event” or, more elaborately, the “3.2 cal ka BP event” (where “cal” stands for “calibrated years,” referring to radiocarbon dating).</p>

  <p class="normal">Martin Finné, a physical geographer and researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden, and his colleagues have stated that this period “seems to have been the overall driest period in the eastern Mediterranean.” According to the most recent studies, there may actually have been two parts to this drought, 1250–1150 BC and again 1100–950 or 1100–850 BC, separated by a brief 50-year period in the middle during which rainfall temporarily returned to normal, but only briefly.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref410" href="Notes.html#_ftn410" title="410">[410]</a></sup></span> These data, a substantial portion of which has become known only in the years since the first edition of this book was published, can be readily summarized and presented as a fairly straightforward chronological narrative, although we will jump from country to country and region to region in our analysis .</p>

  <p class="normal">In 2010, an international team of scholars led by David Kaniewski and Elise Van Campo of the Université de Toulouse in France suggested that they had scientific evidence, from palynology (pollen studies), for climate change and drought in the Mediterranean region at the end of the thirteenth and into the beginning of the twelfth century BC. Initially using data from the site of Tell Tweini (ancient Gibala) in north Syria, the team noted that there may have been “climate instability and a severe drought episode” in the region at that time.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref411" href="Notes.html#_ftn411" title="411">[411]</a></sup></span> They reached that conclusion based on their studies of pollen that they had retrieved by taking core samples from alluvial deposits (silt, sand, clay, and gravel left by a river or streams in antiquity) located near the site. These pollen samples suggested that there had been a change in vegetation, and that “drier climatic conditions occurred in the Mediterranean belt of Syria from the late 13th/early 12th centuries BC to the 9th century BC.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref412" href="Notes.html#_ftn412" title="412">[412]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In 2012, Christopher Bernhardt, who is currently director of the Florence Bascom Geoscience Center at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and his colleagues published the results of a pollen study from coring done in the Burullus Lagoon, in the Nile delta area of Egypt, near the Rosetta branch of the Nile. The pollen indicated that there was an “aridity event” in this area that they date to about 1000 BC. This, they state, was apparently caused by a decrease in rainfall over the Ethiopian plateau, which resulted in a reduced Nile flow, leading to drought conditions in Egypt. Despite the slightly later date, they relate this event to “the fall of the Ugarit Kingdom and famines in the Babylonian and Syrian Kingdoms.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref413" href="Notes.html#_ftn413" title="413">[413]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">At the same time, Brandon Drake of the University of New Mexico provided additional scientific data from a variety of sources in both Israel and Greece. Publishing in the <span class="italic">Journal of Archaeological Science</span> in 2012, he cited additional lines of evidence that support the view that the Early Iron Age was more arid than the preceding Bronze Age. Among these, he noted that Israeli scholars had published oxygen-isotope data from mineral deposits (speleothems) within Soreq Cave in northern Israel which indicated that there was a low annual precipitation during the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. He also noted that other scholars had published data from sediment cores from the Mediterranean which revealed that there was a drop in the sea surface temperature (SST), which in turn would have caused a reduction in precipitation on land (by reducing the temperature differential between land and sea). While it “is difficult to directly identify a point in time when the climate grew more arid,” he said that the change most likely began before 1250–1197 BC, which is precisely the time period under discussion here. <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref414" href="Notes.html#_ftn414" title="414">[414]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Drake also pointed out that there was a sharp increase in Northern Hemi sphere temperatures immediately before the collapse of the Mycenaean palatial centers, possibly causing droughts, followed by a sharp decrease in temperature during the abandonment of these centers, meaning that it first got hotter and then suddenly colder, resulting in “cooler, more arid conditions during the Greek Dark Ages.” As Drake noted, these climatic changes, including a decline in the surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea before 1190 BC that resulted in less rainfall (or snow), could have dramatically affected the palatial centers, especially those that were dependent upon high levels of agricultural productivity, such as in Mycenaean Greece.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref415" href="Notes.html#_ftn415" title="415">[415]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">The following year, in 2013, Kaniewski’s team published data from a lagoon system known as the Larnaca Salt Lake Complex, located by the site of Hala Sultan Tekke in Cyprus. Analyzing the pollen that they had retrieved, they concluded that it presented evidence of a probable drought on Cyprus at this same time. That is to say, their data suggest that “major environmental changes” took place in this area during the end of the Late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, during the period from 1200 to 850 BC. At this time, the area around Hala Sultan Tekke, which had been a major Cypriot port earlier in the Late Bronze Age, “turned into a drier landscape [and] the precipitation and groundwater probably became insufficient to maintain sustainable agriculture in this place.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref416" href="Notes.html#_ftn416" title="416">[416]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Also in 2013, Israel Finkelstein and Dafna Langgut of Tel Aviv University, in conjunction with Thomas Litt at the University of Bonn in Germany, added further palynological data to the picture, this time from Israel. They noted that fossil pollen particles from a twenty-meter-long core drilled through sediments at the bottom of the Sea of Galilee also indicate a period of severe drought beginning ca. 1250 BC in the southern Levant. A second core drilled on the western shore of the Dead Sea provided similar results, but the two cores also indicate that the drought in this region may already have ended by ca. 1100 BC, thereby allowing life to resume in the region, albeit perhaps with new peoples settling down. Additional work, spearheaded by other scientists working in the same area with Litt and publishing both separately and together with the team led by Langgut and Finkelstein, has confirmed these findings.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref417" href="Notes.html#_ftn417" title="417">[417]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Subsequently, following similar work that they did in Haifa Bay, near the modern cities of Akko and Haifa in Israel, Kaniewski and his colleagues found that there had been a change in sea level, as well as evidence for a drought in the area beginning ca. 1200 BC. As they reported in 2014, “the effects of drought were reinforced by the physical processes linked to the coastal changes, causing a dramatic demise in wooded ecosystems.” The pollen indicated that what had been a forested area was replaced by “a thorny shrub-steppe and then by an open-steppe.” The area did not begin to recover, nor did trees reappear, until after 850 BC. <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref418" href="Notes.html#_ftn418" title="418">[418]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">We should note here, as a relevant aside, that some scholars have suggested that deforestation may also have contributed to the decline at the end of the Bronze Age, in part because of the use of wood during the process of smelting copper to make bronze.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref419" href="Notes.html#_ftn419" title="419">[419]</a></sup></span> However, although deforestation did occur in some areas, this seems to have been caused primarily by climate change, as Kaniewski and his colleagues have documented, rather than by human activities. In fact, there is more evidence for deforestation in the subsequent Iron Age, perhaps during the process of smelting iron but also during the continuing drought, than there is toward the end of the Bronze Age,<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref420" href="Notes.html#_ftn420" title="420">[420]</a></sup></span> so it was probably not a major factor in the Collapse.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 2015, Mark Macklin— head of the School of Geography and director of the Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health at the University of Lincoln in England— and his colleagues published a study of the river dynamics in the Nile valley over thousands of years, looking specifically at the relationship with hydroclimatic change and human settlements. They concluded, among many other observations, that there was “a pronounced 200-year long drought centred on c. 1000 cal. BC.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref421" href="Notes.html#_ftn421" title="421">[421]</a></sup></span> We may note that their phrasing indicates that the drought in Egypt did not start ca. 1000 BC, as Bernhardt thought (above), but rather began before and ended after that date, that is, ca. 1100–900 BC or thereabouts.</p>

  <p class="normal">Like Bernhardt and his team, however, Macklin and his colleagues also linked their findings to the events at the end of the Bronze Age, stating, more specifically, “A severe 200 year-long drought centred on 1000 cal BC coincided with Ramesses III clashing with the migrating Libyans and the so called ‘Sea Peoples,’ and socio-economic disturbance associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse in Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref422" href="Notes.html#_ftn422" title="422">[422]</a></sup></span> Kaniewski and his team specifically associate all of this to a “drop in Nile discharge” during the reign of Ramses III, which “led to crop failures/low harvests and riots” in Egypt. They also mention similar problems during the time from Ramses IV through Ramses XI, dating to ca. 1165–1100 BC.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref423" href="Notes.html#_ftn423" title="423">[423]</a></sup></span> Thus, it seems clear that we can now add Egypt to the list of areas that were negatively impacted by drought at the end of the Bronze Age.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 2016 (as well as in 2017 and 2019), Neil Roberts— a highly respected professor of geography who recently retired from the University of Plymouth and is now an honorary research associate in the School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford— and his colleagues published records collected from various lakes in Anatolia, including information derived from stable isotopes and carbonate geochemistry. here, in this region, they found evidence for an arid period starting about 1200 BC and continuing for decades, if not centuries, as reflected in data retrieved from lakes such as Nar, Tecer, Gölhisar, and Eski Acigöl.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref424" href="Notes.html#_ftn424" title="424">[424]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In a 2017 publication, Finkelstein and other members of his “Exact Life Sciences” team took a look at the DNA of cattle that were pre sent in the Bronze Age Levant, as well as the grain that was grown in the area during the period from the late thirteenth and into the twelfth century BC. They concluded that the Egyptians, who were in charge of the administration in Canaan at that time, had had the foresight to plan for the drought, increasing the production of grain and breeding more hardy cattle, in order to counter the climatic problems that they saw coming. This may, in part, explain why they were in a position to send shipments of grain to the Hittites, as we have seen in the texts discussed above.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref425" href="Notes.html#_ftn425" title="425">[425]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Also in 2017, Martin Finné and his colleagues reported on high-resolution oxygen and carbon isotope data that they retrieved from a stalagmite within a cave in Greece. Similar work had been done previously by other teams working in Soreq Cave in Israel, Jeita Cave in central Lebanon, Renella Cave in central Italy, and Sofular Cave in northwestern Turkey.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref426" href="Notes.html#_ftn426" title="426">[426]</a></sup></span> The Greek stalagmite, labeled “S1” by Finné’s team, is located in Mavri Trypa Cave, on Schiza Island just off the coast of southern Greece near the Mycenaean site of Pylos. As they noted, the data indicate that “a brief period of drier conditions around 3200 yrs BP [i.e., 1200 BC] may have disrupted the Mycenaean agricultural system that at the time was likely operating close to its limit. Gradually developing aridity after 3150 yrs BP, i.e. subsequent to the destruction, probably reduced crop yields and helped to erode the basis for the reinstitution of a central authority and the Palace itself.” In other words, they say, the data suggest that the drier conditions and aridity not only caused the decline, but also then prevented the subsequent reestablishment, of the palace at Pylos.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref427" href="Notes.html#_ftn427" title="427">[427]</a></sup></span> Their findings thus support the observations and tentative suggestions concerning the effect of the drought upon the Mycenaean palatial centers put forward by Drake five years earlier.</p>

  <p class="normal">Erika Weiberg, also at Uppsula University, published with Finné additional supporting data for their hypotheses the following year, in 2018. One chart in particular shows a dramatic decline in stable oxygen isotope data, reflecting much less precipitation and thus a “drying trend,” as they call it.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref428" href="Notes.html#_ftn428" title="428">[428]</a></sup></span> This trend suddenly started just about 1200 BC and lasted at least two hundred years, if not longer, for by 1000 BC, Weiberg and Finné say, the stalagmite from Mavri Trypa Cave had stopped growing entirely, probably because of the very dry conditions at that point.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref429" href="Notes.html#_ftn429" title="429">[429]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In addition, Kaniewski and his colleagues have also published further relevant articles nearly every year since the first edition of this book appeared, most recently in 2019 and 2020. These include substantial and convincing overviews based upon their own work as well as that done by other scholars. They provide additional data confirming the onset of a drier period toward the end of the second millennium, and in some cases, specifically from ca. 1250–950 or 1250–850 BC, with a brief uptick in the middle of the period, as outlined above.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref430" href="Notes.html#_ftn430" title="430">[430]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In short, it is clear that numerous scholars, working in many different countries and studying a variety of data, have now gathered the scientific evidence that previous scholars had been seeking, and have made a very strong argument that a drought, or rather a megadrought, contributed to the end of the Late Bronze Age. It seems logical to agree with Kaniewski and his team’s concise conclusion that “the LBA crisis coincided with the onset of a ca. 300-year drought event 3200 years ago. This climate shift caused crop failures, dearth and famine, which precipitated or hastened socio-economic crises and forced regional human migrations at the end of the LBA in the Eastern Mediterranean and southwest Asia.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref431" href="Notes.html#_ftn431" title="431">[431]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">As for what may have caused the megadrought to begin in the Mediterranean area 3,200 years ago, this remains a matter of discussion. A variety of suggestions have been tentatively proposed by scientists, but the issue is by no means resolved. For instance, Giovanni Zanchetta, of the Università di Pisa in Italy, and his coauthors have recently noted that a volcanic eruption of Mount Etna in Sicily ca. 1300 BC could have triggered the drought; they phrase it somewhat more technically, stating that the eruption “seems to herald a new climatic deterioration at ca. 3.3–3.2 cal ka BP.” Still others have suggested that the Thera/Santorini volcano, whose explosion centuries earlier had a disastrous yet temporary impact on the Minoans, may have resumed some sort of activity ca. 1200 BC that could have impacted the climate once again. This is unproven, however, as is the possibility that the Hekla 3 eruption in Iceland ca. 1000 BC may have contributed to the drought as well, albeit after it had already begun.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref432" href="Notes.html#_ftn432" title="432">[432]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Another suggestion is that there may have been a decline in solar output at this time. Such a “solar minimum,” as it is called, might have led to cooler temperatures, which, in turn, could have led to a drought. Thus, Kaniewski and his team have written that “the 1200–850 cal year BCE drought in the Aegean, Eastern Mediterranean, and West Asia that may have hastened crises and contributed to the societal collapse, may have been a regional consequence of a global climate change induced by solar variability.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref433" href="Notes.html#_ftn433" title="433">[433]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Others have noted that when there is an increase in “ice-rafted debris” (IRD) in the North Atlantic, such that it penetrates farther south and west than usual, there is an accompanying decline in ocean surface temperatures and a related decrease in precipitation in the Mediterranean region, which would have resulted in a drought. This is known as a Bond event (named after Gerard Bond, the lead author on <span class="italic">Science</span> articles in 1997 and 2001, rather than after Ian Fleming’s 007 creation). These are thought to occur approximately (but not precisely) e very 1,500 years. One seems to have occurred at the end of the Bronze Age and may have contributed to this megadrought, especially in the central Anatolian area where the event is reflected in lake sediments.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref434" href="Notes.html#_ftn434" title="434">[434]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Similarly, and perhaps related, there are Rapid Climate Changes (RCCs), which are marked by “cold spells”— that is, a sea surface temperature (SST) drop of 2–3°C in the southeastern Aegean region. These are caused by frigid polar air coming down into the region, creating arid conditions in the Aegean, as Drake discussed in his 2012 article. Such RCCs are well dated and have occurred some six times during the Holocene (the period from approximately 12,000 years ago to the pre sent), once e very 1,450 years or so (i.e., at about the same intervals as the Bond events).<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref435" href="Notes.html#_ftn435" title="435">[435]</a></sup></span> They have been linked to major changes that can be seen in the archaeological record, such as the domestication of plants and animals during the Neolithic Revolution, which began approximately ten thousand years ago, but of particular interest to us is the one dated to 3.1–2.9kya, ca. 1100–900 BC. It has been closely examined by a number of scientists, including Eelco Rohling of the Australian National University and Bernhard Weninger of the University of Cologne in Germany, who have discussed it specifically in connection with the megadrought that took place at the end of the Bronze Age and beyond.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref436" href="Notes.html#_ftn436" title="436">[436]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In the first edition of this book, I noted that, despite all of the evidence available in 2014, I thought we still needed to acknowledge that droughts have been frequent in this region throughout history, and that they have not always caused civilizations to collapse. Therefore, I agreed with Drake, arguing that, on their own, climate change, drought, and famines, even if they “influenced social tensions, and eventually led to competition for limited resources,”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref437" href="Notes.html#_ftn437" title="437">[437]</a></sup></span> would probably not have been enough to have caused the end of the Late Bronze Age without substantial involvement of other factors.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, however, given the additional data that have appeared in the years since 2014, while I would still posit multifactor causation, I am inclined to think that this megadrought is likely to have been the principal driving force behind many of the problems that Late Bronze Age societies faced. For example, the texts from sites like Ugarit in Syria confirm that with the drought came famine, with people starving. And with famine came upheaval, including armed attacks and internal rebellions, which created serious international security problems, as I pointed out in a <span class="italic">New York Times</span> op-ed.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref438" href="Notes.html#_ftn438" title="438">[438]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In terms of possible links between droughts and civil unrest, a parallel can be seen with the recent conflict in modern Syria, for a news report on a study done by Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory suggests that “drought may have helped propel the 2011 Syrian uprising.” The article describes the drought as having “destroyed agriculture in the breadbasket region of northern Syria, driving dispossessed farmers to cities, where poverty, government mismanagement and other factors created unrest that exploded in spring 2011.” The coauthor of the Columbia study stated: «We’re not saying the drought caused the war. We’re saying that added to all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict.” Other scholars have also concluded that the drought and the civil war in Syria are probably linked, in a growing number of studies and articles published since 2012.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref439" href="Notes.html#_ftn439" title="439">[439]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">I would still maintain, however, that it was not simply a linear progression from drought to famine to upheaval that ended the Bronze Age. Moreover, in my opinion, none of the individual factors that we have discussed above— drought, famine, earthquakes, or invaders— would have been sufficiently cataclysmic on their own to bring down even one of the Bronze Age civilizations in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, let alone all of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1985, when Nancy Sandars published a revised edition of her classic book on the Sea Peoples, she said much the same. “In the lands surrounding the Mediterranean,” she wrote, «there have <span class="italic">always</span> been earthquakes, famines, droughts and floods, and in fact dark ages of a sort are recurrent.” Furthermore, she stated, “catastrophes punctuate human history but they are generally survived without too much loss. They are often followed by a much greater effort leading to greater success.” And, as she noted, in terms of explaining the Collapse at the end of the Bronze Age, “many explanations have been tried and few have stood. Unparalleled series of earthquakes, widespread crop-failures and famine, massive invasion from the steppe, the Danube, the desert— all may have played some part; but they are not enough.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref440" href="Notes.html#_ftn440" title="440">[440]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">So what was different about this period at the end of the Late Bronze Age? What caused whole civilizations to collapse rather than simply to falter and then recover and carry on? Kaniewski and others have suggested that the prolonged drought and the resulting widespread and long-persisting famine exacerbated the other stressors, resulting in what is known as a “multiplier effect.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref441" href="Notes.html#_ftn441" title="441">[441]</a></sup></span> As a consequence, the various societies lacked the most basic resources necessary to rebuild and renew themselves. This in turn, the scholars argue, contributed to their rapid collapse. Drought lasting a year or two, or even ten years, doesn’t necessarily mean that the impacted society will fall. However, a megadrought that persists between a hundred and three hundred years simply does not allow the inhabitants any respite, or opportunity to recover. When the drought finally ends, the original inhabitants and their society may no longer exist.</p>

This is what would have led to the rapid disintegration of one society after another, in part because of the fragmentation of the global economy and the breakdown of the interconnections upon which each civilization was dependent. In short, the flourishing cultures and peoples of the Bronze Age— from the Mycenaeans and Minoans to the Hittites, Assyrians, Kassites/Babylonians, Cypriots, Mitannians, Canaanites, and even Egyptians— were simply not able to survive the onslaught of so many different stressors all at the same time.</p>
