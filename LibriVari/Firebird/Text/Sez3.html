  <p class="normal">‘I just received a radio message from Larkin, Sal, Louren is arriving tomorrow.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I was disappointed in her negative reaction, because I was sure she had overcome her initial dislike of Louren for my sake - and that she had begun to like him.</p>

  <p class="normal">I went to meet Louren at the airstrip, and I was shocked. He had lost 20 lb in weight, and his skin which usually glowed with golden health was now chalky grey. Beneath his eyes were smears of dark plum that looked like bruises.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben! ’ He put an affectionate arm around my shoulder and squeezed. ‘It’s good to see you, you old bastard.’ But his voice was weary and I noticed the threads of silver at bis temples which were newly acquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My God, Lo, you look terrible.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thanks.’ He grinned wryly, and slung his bags into the back of the Land-Rover.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Seriously, Lo. Are you sick or something?’ I was distressed to see him looking so ill and haggard.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ve been on a rough one, Ben,’ he confided as he climbed into the Land-Rover beside me. ‘Four weeks at the bargaining table, I had to do it all myself - could not trust anyone else to handle it. The other side sent in teams, changing them when they were worn out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re going to kill yourself,’ I scolded him, sounding a little like a nagging wife. And he leaned across, punched my arm lightly, and laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re a shot in the arm, partner.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Was it worth it? What was it about?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s big, Ben! E – bloody – normous! Copper and iron. South West Africa, near the Cunene River, massive ore bodies lying in association, low-grade copper and high-grade iron – together they are a treasure chest.’ The weary tone was gone from his voice. ‘I put those little Jap bastards over the table and I roasted their arses. They will put in the finance for a deep-water harbour and a railway line to get the stuff out. That will cost them 150 million.’ He was exultant, colour coming back into the pale cheeks. ‘One of my companies will do the construction work, of course.’ He touched a finger to his lips in a conspiratory gesture and I giggled delightedly. I enjoyed him in this mood. ‘I’ll put up for the pelletization plant and… ’ He went on to outline the scheme, laughing and punching my arm when he recounted each bargaining point on which he had scored.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What will it make for you?’ I asked at last, and he looked at me, slightly put down.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You mean in terms of money?’ he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure! What else?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hell, Ben. I’ve explained it before. That’s not the important thing. It’s not money, it’s exports and employment, and opening up new resources, and building for the future, realizing the potential of our country and - and—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And getting one hell of a kick out of it,’ I suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">He laughed again. ‘You are too shrewd, Ben. I suppose that’s a lot of it. The game, not the score.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you seen last week’s <em>Time</em> magazine?’ I asked. I knew it would needle him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, for God’s sake, Ben,’ he protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Your name is on the list of the world’s thirty richest men.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Those bastards,’ he muttered darkly. ‘Now everybody doubles their prices. Why don’t they mind their own business and let me get on with mine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And in the process you are killing yourself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re right, Ben. I do feel a little spent, so I’m taking a week. A whole week’s holiday.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Big deal,’ I sneered, ‘a holiday with your BYM arriving every half-hour for conferences, and the rest of the time with you hanging over the radio set.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Forget it,’ he smiled. I’m getting away, and you’re coming with me.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you mean, Lo? I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell you later.’ He avoided the question for we were approaching the branch in the dirt track, and I automatically slowed to turn down to the huts.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Straight on, Ben,’ Louren instructed. ‘I want to go up to the cavern. I’ve been thinking of that place for weeks.’ His voice went soft and reflective. ‘When things got really tough there at the table, I’d think about the peace and tranquillity of that place. It seemed to…’ He stopped, and coughed with embarrassment. Louren doesn’t often talk that way.</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Sally</em> was working at the rear wall of the cavern. She wore a green silk blouse and tailored khaki slacks, with her hair loose and shiny. As she looked up to greet Louren, I saw with mild surprise that she wore lipstick for the first time in weeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">She noticed his haggard features immediately, and I saw the concern in her eyes although she said nothing about it. Her greeting was subdued, almost offhand, and she turned back to her easel. Louren went immediately to the portrait of the white king. I drifted across to join him and we sat in a friendly relaxed silence examining the strange, figure, Louren spoke first.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you get the feeling he’s trying to tell you something, Ben?’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a fanciful question for Louren, but I treated it with respect for he was clearly in deadly earnest.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Lo, I can’t say that I do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is something here, Ben,’ he said with certainty ‘Something you - we have overlooked. The key to this place, the whole secret of it is in this cavern.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, Lo. we could…’ I began but he wasn’t listening. Sally left her easel and came to join us, she sat beside Louren and watched his face with complete attention.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This feeling has never let me down, Ben. Do you remember the Desolation Valley mine? My geologists gave it a thumbs down, but I had this feeling. Do you remember?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I nodded. Desolation Valley was now yielding twenty thousand carats of gem diamonds a month.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is something here. I am sure of it, but where?’ He turned to stare at me, as though I had hidden whatever he was searching for, ‘Where is it, Ben? The floor, the walls, the roof?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the pool,’ I said,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All right, let’s start with the pool,’ he agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s too deep, Lo. No diver—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you know about diving?’ he demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I’ve dived a couple of times.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, for God’s sake, Ben!’ he interrupted brusquely. ‘When I need a heart operation I go to Chris Barnard, not the local vet. Who is the best diver in the world?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Cousteau, I suppose.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fine. I’ll get my people on to him. That takes care of the pool. Now the floor—’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dealing with Louren is like being caught in a hurricane. At the end of an hour, he had outlined a scheme for a thorough investigation of the cavern, and at last he suggested casually, ‘Okay, Ben. Why don’t you go on back to camp. I’d like an hour or so alone here.’ I was reluctant to miss a minute of his company but I stood up immediately.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you coming, Sal?’ I asked. Louren wanted to be alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Ben. I’m in the middle of—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s okay, Ben,’ Louren told me, ‘she won’t disturb me.’ And I left them in the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">The guest hut was long ago prepared, but I went with one of the servants to supervise the unpacking of Louren’s bags. I noticed that someone had cut a spray of the wild cave-lilies that grew under the cliffs, and placed them in a beer tankard beside the bed. I meant to compliment the Matabele who acted as our cook, butler and housekeeper for this thoughtful little touch. It relieved the bleakness of the hut.</p>

  <p class="normal">After checking Louren’s accommodation I went down to the big bungalow and made sure there was ice in the refrigerator and plenty of cold water. Then I cracked the seal on a fresh bottle of Glen Grant - Louren and I have a common fondness for this nectar. While I was busy with the whisky bottle, Ral and Leslie came in off the dig and I heard them clump into the office next door. I did not intend eavesdropping, but the partition walls were paper-thin.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ral growled like an enraged beast, and Leslie squealed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, you are naughtyl’ she cried breathlessly, and it was clear that she had been physically molested. ‘Someone will catch you doing that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As long as they don’t catch me doing what I’m going to do tonight,’ Ral declared.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Shh!’ Leslie enjoined silence, but to no avail.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Five weeks. I thought he’d never come. I was going mad.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Rally Dally darling,’ wheezed Leslie in high passion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Toodles, my little Toodles,’ Ral replied, and I blushed for them. Silently I set down the bottle and stole from the room. I was slightly puzzled as to how Louren’s arrival, for that was obviously what Ral was referring to, could make such a dramatic improvement in their physical relationship, and I envied them for I had no such expectation.</p>

  <p class="normal">We were all of us sick to the stomach with a diet of canned and preserved food. Louren had brought with him a full load of fresh fruit, vegetables and meat. That night we had a sucking pig, golden brown in its suit of crackling, with roast potatoes, green peas and a gigantic bowl of fresh salad. There was very little conversation at the dinner-table.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once the dishes were cleared, Louren lit a cigar, I refilled the glasses and we all settled down in a circle about Louren. First I reported to Louren the discovery of the quarry, and the deductions we had made from it. This led on to an exhibition of Sally’s reconstruction of the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">I had not expected Louren to react the way he did. I had thought he might be mildly amused, as we were, not that he would accept our fantasy as proven fact. He worked himself into a fever of excitement, jumping up from his chair to examine each illustration, firing his abrupt searching questions at us, or simply sitting hunched forward in his seat staring at the painting with glitter-eyed concentration. His face was still pale and ravaged, which gave an almost demented intensity to his expression.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally, with a touch of canny showmanship, had kept the painting of the white king for the last. As she lifted it onto the board I saw Louren stiffen in his seat. The white king was in full battle armour, helmet and breastplate in glistening bronze, shield slung, and a short sword girt around his waist. His red-gold beard was curled and clubbed, and his bearing regal. His attendants followed him through the gates of the high outer wall, one carried his battle-axe, another his bow and a quiver of arrows, a third bore the golden chalice of eternal life.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally had lavished patient skill upon this particular illustration, and it was the most impressive of the whole series. We all stared at it in silence until suddenly I uncrossed my legs and leaned forward quickly, spilling a little of my whisky in my surprise. I had not noticed it before, the golden beard had masked it, but now I realized suddenly whom Sally had used as her model for the white king. I turned to stare at Louren, and there was the same deep forehead, the noble brow above wide-set piercing pale blue eyes, the same straight nose with delicately chiselled nostrils, and the proud curve of mouth with the slightly sensual pout of the lower lip.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben!’ His voice was husky, he did not take his eyes off the portrait. ‘This is remarkable -I hadn’t realized until this evening what this meant. Up to now it was just intriguing blocks of stone, and a few beads and scraps of gold. I never really thought about the people. That’s the important thing, Ben! These men that voyaged to the ends of their world; that built something magnificent in the wilderness—’ He broke off, and shook his head slowly, considering the magnitude, the grandeur of it. Then he turned to me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben. We have got to find out what happened to them, and their city. I don’t care how long it takes, how much it costs. I have got to know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he stubbed out his cigar and jumped up from his chair, began pacing with a barely controlled violence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s about time we announced this, Ben. I will set up a Press conference. I’ll want you all there to explain it. The world must know about these men.’</p>

  <p class="normal">My stomach dropped steeply with alarm, and I stuttered a protest.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But, Lo, we can’t do that. Not now, not yet - please!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why not?’ He wheeled on me belligerently.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We haven’t got enough proof yet.’ I went chill with horror, as I thought how my critics would hang, draw and quarter me if I went out on the stage with such a sorry script. ‘They’ll scalp us, Lo. They’ll tear us to pieces.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’ll show them these.’ He pointed at the paintings.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘God!’ I shuddered at the thought. ‘Those are just conjecture, fantasy, in that picture the only single detail we could substantiate would be the chalice.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren stared at me, but I saw the madness fading in his eyes. Suddenly he laughed guiltily, and struck his forehead with the heel of his hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wow!’ he laughed. ‘I must be tired! For a moment there those paintings were real, from life!’ He went to stand before the painting again and examined it wistfully. ‘I’ve got to know, Ben,’ he said again, ‘I’ve just got to know.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The following day, while we ate lunch beside the emerald pool, Louren told me how he and I were to get away together. He used Sally’s charcoal stick to draw on the flat surface of a rock.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here we are, and here sixty-five miles to the north-east are the ruins at Doinboshaba. If your theories are correct then there was an ancient caravan route between the two cities You and I are going to take the Land-Rover. and go crosscountry, trying to pick up the old trail.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s pretty rough country,’ I pointed out, without enthusiasm. ‘Completely unexplored, no roads, no water.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And no BYM,’ Louren smiled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That makes it irresistible.’ I returned his smile, remembering that this was therapeutic not scientific. ‘When do we leave?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tomorrow morning at first light.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was still dark when I awoke, and my bedside clock showed four-thirty. It was too late to go back to sleep and too early to get up. I was pondering the problem when the door of the hut opened stealthily and, as I prepared to repel burglars, Ral’s hairy head silhouetted by the moonlight appeared around the jamb.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had given me a fright so I shouted at him, ‘What are you doing?’</p>

  <p class="normal">If I had been frightened, it was as nothing to Ral’s reaction to my question. Letting out a howl of terror he leapt about three feet in the air with his arms flapping, rather like a crested crane doing its mating dance. It took him a minute or two to recover himself sufficiently to shamble across to his bed and reply in a shaky voice, ‘I’ve been to the toilet.’ Which was just as well, I thought, otherwise my challenge could have had disastrous consequences. I got up, dressed and went out to check the Land-Rover. I suppose I guessed that Ral had been with Leslie, but I did not realize the implications of this.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took Louren and me most of the first day to find a way over the Hills of Blood that the Land-Rover could negotiate. We followed the line of cliffs northward until they dwindled away and broke up into low kopjes and we could climb one of the gullies between them. It was a rugged ascent that taxed even that sturdy vehicle, but once on the top the going was through open savannah and scattered acacia forest and we made good progress, swinging away southward again to pick up the caravan route that Louren had hopefully drawn in on his large scale map.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night we camped astride it, or at least where we hoped it might have been. With the amount of gasoline and water aboard, there was scant room for the luxuries of camp life. Besides it was meant to be a rough trip to dispel the smogs and grimes of civilization, a nostalgic return to the expeditions we had made together in our youth.</p>

  <p class="normal">We grilled a brace of sand-grouse over the coals, and drank Glen Grant and sun-warmed water from enamel mugs. Then with hollows scraped from the hard earth for hip and shoulder we rolled into our sleeping bags beside the Land-Rover and chatted drowsily and contentedly for an hour before falling asleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the dawn Louren massaged his back and gingerly worked the stiffness out of his muscles.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ve just remembered I’m not twenty any longer,’ he groaned, but by the third day he was looking it. The sun coloured him again, the bruises under his eyes were gone and he laughed freely.</p>

  <p class="normal">Our progress was slow. Often it was necessary to retrace our spoor out of broken ground whose kopjes and ridges denied us passage. Then we would leave the Land-Rover and go in on foot to try and pioneer a way through. There was no hurry, however, so we could fully enjoy each mile as we groped our way north and east through country that changed its character and mood with the bewitching rapidity that is Africa’s alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Each hour of eastward travel rewarded us with more evidence of bird and animal life. The dry-land birds gave way to guinea fowl, francolin, and the gigantic korrie bustard. While amongst the mopani and masasa trees there was the occasional silver-grey flash of a running kudu, with his long corkscrew horns laid flat along his back.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Water not far away,’ Louren commented as we stopped the Land-Rover at the edge of one of those open glades of yellow grass and watched a herd of stable antelope move away into the trees on the far side. The most stately antelope in Africa, proud heads holding the curved scimitar horns high and the dazzling contrast of snowy breast against black body.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Another endangered species,’ I remarked sadly. ‘Making way for the greed and excesses of man.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ Louren agreed. ‘And you know something, there’s not one single specimen of <em>homo sapiens</em> that’s half as beautiful, and that,’ he said, ‘includes Raquel Welch.’</p>

  <p class="normal">That night we camped in a grove of masasa trees, clad in their outlandish spring foliage which has the colours of no other tree on earth - pinks, soft shiny beige, and flaming reds. Louren had shot a young impala ram during the day and he wrapped the fillets in bacon and roasted them in a heavy iron pot while I made a sauce of onions and tomato and plenty of garlic. We ate it with thick slices of brown bread and yellow tinned butter and it tasted like no other food I had ever known.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If you ever need a job, Lo, you can come cook for me,’ I told him around a mouthful. He grinned and went to the Land-Rover to switch on the radio.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What was the deal?’ I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Just the news.’ He had the grace to look guilty. ‘Can’t lose touch entirely.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We listened to the strivings and strugglings of a world gone mad. Somehow, in this remote and tranquil place the affairs of man seemed unimportant, petty and transient.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Switch it off, Lo,’ I said. ‘Who needs it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached for the control knob of the set, but checked his hand as the voice of the announcer spoke a familiar name.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lusaka Radio reports that the leader of the terrorist gang which yesterday ambushed a detachment of police in the Wankie district of Rhodesia, killing four and wounding two others, is the self-styled “Colonel” Timothy Mageba who two months ago made world headlines in his dramatic hijacking bid. A spokesman for the Rhodesian police said that Mageba is probably one of the most dangerous terrorists in Africa. A reward of 10,000 Rhodesian dollars has been offered for information leading to his death or capture.’</p>

  <p class="normal">With a savage gesture Louren switched off the set and came back to the fire. He sipped his whisky before speaking.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He’s operating only 100 miles or so north of here, I’d give anything to get a chance at that one.’</p>

  <p class="normal">News of Timothy disturbed me deeply, and that night I lay long awake with my hands behind my head staring up at the starry splendour of the night sky. Venus had dropped below the horizon before I fell into a sleep troubled with ugly dreams.</p>

  <p class="normal">The morning sun lit the crests of the kopjes a fresh gold and inflamed the sky with virulent reds and purples, driving away dark thoughts and we talked and laughed together as we picked our way slowly towards the east.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the middle of the morning we saw the vultures circling off towards the north, a vast wheel of specks turning slowly beneath the hard blue sky. Following the flight of these grotesque scavengers is one of the most intriguing invitations that Africa has to offer. For every time they will lead you to the scene of some desperate incident in the never-ending drama of the wilderness.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A couple of miles off,’ Louren commented, peering eagerly ahead through the windscreen. I shared his curiosity. The hell with ruined cities and lost civilizations, this was the stark, raw rule of tooth and claw we were going to witness.</p>

  <p class="normal">A quarter of a mile ahead of us we saw the hunch-backed bird shapes squatting obscenely in the tree-tops, thick as some devil’s fruit in the orchards of hell.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are off the kill.’ Louren was jubilant ‘Something’s keeping them up in the trees and sky.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He stopped the Land-Rover, and switched off the ignition. We climbed out, and Louren checked the load of his big .375 magnum, changing the solid bullets for soft-nosed ones that would deliver a heavier knock-down blow.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’ll walk up,’ he said. ‘I’d love a chance at a big black-maned lion.’ He snapped the bolt of the rifle closed, ‘Take the shotgun, Ben, load with buckshot.’</p>

  <p class="normal">This is my sort of thinking. If a lion is far enough away to warrant the use of a rifle then he and I have got no quarrel; closer than that I like a weapon that I can’t miss with.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren set off through the waist-high grass, I followed him, keeping out on his flank to open my line of fire, the shotgun loaded for lion and my pockets bulging with spare shells. We moved in slowly, trying to find the focal point of this gathering of vultures for they were scattered in the trees over an area of half a square mile.</p>

  <p class="normal">Every step heightened our tension with the expectation of walking on top of a pride of lions lying in the grass. Louren signalled each change of direction to me, as we quartered carefully back and forth over the ground. From the trees around us the birds launched into flight, changing miraculously from ungainly repose into something graceful and beautiful as they entered their true element.</p>

  <p class="normal">My throat was dry with excitement, and a pleasurable fear. I could see Louren was sweating through the back of his shirt, not entirely from the heat. His every movement was charged with restrained energy, ready to explode at the first sign of the quarry. I loved this part of the hunt, for there is the atavistic urge of hunter still hidden in most of us, it was only the killing that repulsed me.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren froze, rifle at high port. He was staring ahead, and I braced myself for the heavy detonation of the shot that I knew must follow; but the seconds passed slowly as dripping oil and still Louren stood with only the slightest movement of his head as he searched.</p>

  <p class="normal">Quietly I moved up beside him. Ahead of us was an area of flattened and trampled grass. In the centre of it lay the body of a dead buffalo, his belly bloated with gas, and big shiny green flies swarming over his dead eyes and into his open mouth. I could see no marks of claws in the thick hide, with its coarse black hair blotched with patches of shiny baldness and rough scab.</p>

  <p class="normal">I looked down at the ground, not wishing to tread on a twig as I moved again, and I saw the small childlike human footprint in a patch of ant-turned earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">I felt the hair at the back of my neck prickle, we had walked into something a damned sight more dangerous than a pride of lions. Quickly I looked back to the dead buffalo, and for the first time noticed two inches of a frail reed stalk protruding from the folded skin of the neck. The flesh around it was swollen tight and hard.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lo!’ I croaked huskily. ‘Let’s get the hell out of here - this is a bushman kill.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren’s head jerked around and he stared at me. I saw the rim of his nostrils fade to china white.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How do you know?’ he demanded hoarsely</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Footprints at your feet.’ He glanced down, ‘Arrow in the buffalo’s neck.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He was convinced. ‘This is your shauri, Sen. What do we do?’ Now he was sweating as heavily as I was.</p>

  <p class="normal">I said ‘Slowly, slowly! Don’t turn your back and don’t move suddenly. They are watching us, Lo, Probably right here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We began backing off, clutching our weapons with sweat-greasy hands, eyes darting restlessly from side to side.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Talk to them, for God’s sake, Ben!’ Louren whispered. I found time to examine the discovery that the threat of poison could turn even a man like Louren into a coward.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can’t take the chance. Anything could trigger them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They may be behind us.’ His voice shook, and I felt my skin between the shoulder blades cringe as I listened for the flute of the arrow. With each pace backwards I felt my fear shrinking, and fifty yards from the kill I risked hailing them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Peace,’ I called. ‘We mean you no harm.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The reply came immediately, birdlike and disembodied, seeming to emanate from the heated air itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell the big white-head to lay down his weapon, for we do not know him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Xhai.’ I cried out my relief and delight. ‘My brother!’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">‘His eye was bright as the yellow moon,</p>

  <p class="normal">His hoof struck fire from the iron hills.‘</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">We sang the buffalo song together, the men squatting around the leaping fire, clapping out the complicated rhythm with our hands. The women danced in an outer circle around us, swaying and shuffling, miming the buffalo and his gallant hunter. The firelight shone on their golden-yellow skins, their tiny childlike bodies with the startling bulge of buttocks and the fat little yellow breasts joggling to the dance rhythm.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">‘The arrow-bird flew from my hand</p>

  <p class="normal">Swift as a bee, or a stooping hawk.‘</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The branches of the trees around us were heavy with festoons of raw meat, hung out to dry, and beyond the firelight the jackal and hyena howled their frustrations to the star-bright heavens, as they snuffed the tantalizing odours.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The blood when it flowed was bright as a flower</p>

  <p class="normal">And sweet as wild honey was the flesh of his body,‘</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The dance ended at last, and the women giggled and trilled as they flocked to the fire to cram more meat into their little round bellies. Bushmen and women are awed by physical size, and to them Louren was a huge golden giant. They discussed him in a frank and intimate manner, starting at his golden head and working downwards until I laughed out aloud.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s so funny?’ Louren demanded, and I told him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My God, they didn’t say that!’ Louren was shocked, staring at the women in horror, and they covered their mouths with their hands as they giggled.</p>

  <p class="normal">I sat between Xhai and Louren, one of them smoking and the other eating a Romeo and Juliette cigar, and I translated for them. They spoke of the animals and the birds for they had a common love of the chase.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My grandfather told me that when he was a young man the buffalo in this land below the great river were as locusts, black upon the earth - but then the red sickness came.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Rinderpest,’ I explained to Louren.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And they died so that they fell one upon the other, so thick that the vultures could not fly with the load of their bellies, and their bones lay in the sun like the fields of white Namaqua daisies in the spring time’</p>

  <p class="normal">They talked on after the women and children had curled up and fallen asleep like little yellow puppies in the dust. They spoke of noble animals and great hunts, and they became friends beside the fire so that at last Xhai told me shyly, ‘I should like to share the hunt with such a one. I could show him an elephant, like those that my grandfather knew, with teeth as thick as my waist and as long as the shaft of a throwing spear.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And there goes any further pretence of looking for ruins and caravan routes, I thought, as I watched Louren’s face light up at the suggestion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But,’ I added, ‘he says you must leave the Land-Rover here. They heard us coming for half an hour before we arrived today and he says this elephant is old and cunning. Which means we will have to get some sleep now. We’ve got a hell of a day ahead of us tomorrow.’</p>

  <p class="normal">By the time the sun came up we had been on the march for three hours, dew had soaked our trousers to the knees but we had walked the night’s chill out of our joints and were extending ourselves, stepping out with full stride to keep the two tiny brown figures in view. Xhai and Ghal were into that loose-limbed trot that would eat away the miles all day without flagging, their little brown forms danced ahead of us through the thickening thorns and Jessie bush.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How you doing, Ben?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I grunted and changed the shotgun to my other shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The little bastards can certainly foot it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Brother, you have only just started,’ I warned him. They led us into bad, broken country where harsh black ridges of ironstone thrust from the earth and the thorn was grey and spiny and matted, where deep ravines rent the walls of steep tableland outcrops and the heat was a fierce dazzling thing that sucked the moisture from our bodies and dried it in rings of white salt on our shirts. It was the type of country that a canny old elephant bull, pursued by men all his life, might choose as a retreat.</p>

  <p class="normal">We rested for half an hour at noon, seeking shade in the lee of a boulder whose black surface was scalding to the touch and drinking a few mouthfuls of lukewarm water, then we went on and almost immediately cut the spoor.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There and there.’ With the point of a poison arrow, Xhai traced the outline of a padmark on the iron-hard earth. ‘Do you not see it?’ he asked with exasperation, and though we circled the area, tilting our heads learnedly, neither of us could make it out.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If that’s an elephant spoor,’ muttered Louren, ‘I’m a Chinese tinker.’ But Xhai set off confidently on a new bearing through the thorns, and we climbed one of the rocky tablelands, following a trail that Louren and I could not even see. Near the crest of the hill, lay a pile of elephant dung, still moist despite the furnace-dry heat, and a cloud of yellow and orange butterflies hovered over it attracted by the wetness. The dung looked like the contents of a coir mattress.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Velly solly,’ I whispered to Louren, ‘please fixee pottee -chop chop.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The man’s a bloody magician.’ Louren shook his head in amazement, as he unslung the heavy rifle from his shoulder and tucked it under his arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">We went on again, but slowly now, pausing frequently while Xhai and Ghal searched the impenetrable thickets of thorn ahead of us. It was a gut-aching business in this close bush, each step planned and made only at a signal from Xhai’s dainty pink-palmed hand, moving forward when the hand beckoned and freezing when it froze.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come,’ said the hand and we went on again, then abruptly—</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Stop!’ A quick cut-out sign, with the hand like a blade, then balling into a fist and pointing ahead, bad luck to point with a finger at the quarry.</p>

  <p class="normal">We stood still as death, sweat-shiny faces staring ahead into the wall of thorn - and then suddenly the elephant loomed ghostly grey amongst the grey thorn, moving from us in a leisurely sway-backed shamble, grey skin wrinkled and old, hanging in bags and pouches at the belly and in the crotch of his back legs, the tail bare of tuft hair, the knuckles of the spine showing clearly through the ridged skin on his back. Old elephant. Big elephant.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Stay here!’ Xhai’s hand pointed at Ghal and me, and I nodded in acknowledgement.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come with me!’ Xhai’s forefinger crooked at Louren, and they went on together, circling out on the elephant’s flank through the thorn. The bushman doll-like beside Louren’s bulk, leading him around for a clean shot at the head or shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">The elephant paused, and began feeding from one of the thickets, delicately plucking the pale green shoots with the tip of his trunk, stuffing them into his mouth, completely unaware of danger - while out on his flank Louren reached a firing stance and braced himself, legs spread, leaning forward to meet the recoil of the heavy rifle.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shot was stunningly loud, shocking in the heat-drugged silence. I heard the bullet slap into flesh, and the elephant spun away from the impact, turning to face Louren, with its long yellow ivories lifted high, the huge grey ears cocked back, and it squealed as it saw the man. It squealed in anger, and a long smouldering hatred now burst into flame.</p>

  <p class="normal">It crabbed sideways as it began the charge, blanketing Louren’s line of fire with a thicket of thorns. I saw Louren turn and run out to the side, trying to open his front for a clear shot. His foot hit an ant-bear hole and he fell in full run, going down heavily, the rifle flying from his hand, lying stunned full in the path of the charge.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren!’ I screamed, and then I was running also, armed with only a shotgun, racing to head the charge of a wounded bull elephant.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here!’ I screamed at it as I ran. ‘Here!’ Trying to lead it off him, in the corner of my vision I saw Louren on hands and knees crawling painfully towards his rifle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yah! Yay!’ I screamed with all the strength of my lungs, and the bull checked his charge, his head swinging towards me, piggy eyes seeking me, trunk questing for my scent.</p>

  <p class="normal">I threw up the shotgun, and at thirty yards’ range I aimed for his little eyes, hoping to blind him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Blam! <span lang="en-US">Blam!</span> I fired left and right into his face, and he came at me. I felt a vast sense of relief as his charge exploded towards me. I had taken him off Louren - that was all that counted. With clumsy fingers I groped for fresh cartridges, knowing that before I could reload he would be upon me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Run, Ben, run!’ Louren’s voice, high above the ground-thudding charge of the bull. But I found my legs would not function, and I stood in the path of the charge, groping stupidly for cartridges which were useless as thrown peppercorns against this grey mountain of flesh.</p>

  <p class="normal">The blast of Louren’s rifle beat against my numbed brain, once - twice, it crashed out and like an avalanche the grey mountain fell towards me, dead already, the brain shattered like an overripe fruit at the passage of the heavy bullet.</p>

  <p class="normal">My feet were rooted to the earth, I could not move, could not dodge, and the outflung trunk hit me with savage force. I felt myself thrown through air, and then the cruel impact of earth and my brain burst into bright colours and stabbing lights as I went out.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You silly bastard! Oh, you silly brave little bastard.’ I heard Louren’s voice speaking to me down a long dark tunnel, and the sound of it echoed strangely in my head. Cool wetness splashed over my face, blessed wetness on my lips and I opened my eyes. Louren was sitting on the ground, my head was cradled in his lap and he was splashing water from the bottle into my face.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who are you calling a bastard?’ I croaked up at him, and the expression of relief that flooded over his worried features was one of the most satisfying things I have ever seen.</p>

  <p class="normal">I was stiff and sore, bruised of shoulder and across the small of my back, and there was a lump above my temple that was too painful to touch.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can you walk?’ Louren fussed over me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I can try.’ It wasn’t too painful, and I even found the inclination to photograph the huge dead beast as it knelt in a prayerful attitude with the head supported on the curved yellow tusks. Louren and the bushman sat on its head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will camp tonight at the Water-In-The-Rocks,’ Xhai told me, ‘and tomorrow we will return and take the teeth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How far is it?’ I asked dubiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Close!’ Xhai assured me. ‘Very close.’ And I scowled at him uncertainly. I had heard him use the same words to describe a march of fifty miles.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It had bloody well better be,’ I said in English, and to my surprise it was much closer than I had expected - and a lot of other things I had not expected either.</p>

  <p class="normal">We crossed one ridge with me hobbling along on Louren’s arm and then came out on a wide granite sheet, a great curved dome of rock almost four acres in extent. I took one look at it, at the lines of shallow rounded holes that dimpled the entire surface, and I let out a whoop of joy. Suddenly I no longer needed Louren’s support, and both of us ran down onto the stone floor, chortling with glee, as we examined the regular lines of worn depressions.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It must have been a big one, Ben,’ Louren exulted, he made a guess at the number of holes. ‘A thousand?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘More!’ I said. ‘More like two thousand.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I paused then, imagining the long regular lines of naked slaves kneeling on the rock floor, each beside one of the smooth depressions, each of them linked to his neighbours by the iron slave chains, each of them with a heavy iron pestle in his hands, pounding away at the gold-bearing ore in the stone mortar between his knees.</p>

  <p class="normal">I saw in my imagination the slave masters walking along the lines, the leather whips in their hands as they checked that the rock was crushed to a fine powder. I saw the endless columns of slaves with ore baskets balanced on their heads coming up from the workings. All this had happened here nearly 2,000 years before.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I wonder where the mine is.’ Louren was paralleling my thoughts.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the water?’ I added. ‘They’d need water to wash the gold out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The hell with the water,’ Louren shouted. ‘It’s the mine I want, those old boys only worked values of three ounces and over and they stopped at water level - there’s a bloody treasure house around here somewhere.’</p>

  <p class="normal">This was how all the ancient mines had been destroyed. It was a credit to the skill of the ancient metallurgists that the site of nearly every modern mine in central Africa had been discovered by them 2,000 years before. The modern miners ripped out all trace of the ancient workings in their haste to expose the abandoned reef. I made a vow that at the least I would be first into this one, before the vandals with their drills and dynamite.</p>

  <p class="normal">The water was at the bottom of a fifty-foot well, cut cleanly through the living rock, its walls lined with masonry. It was the finest example of an ancient well I had ever seen; clearly it had been kept in good repair by the bushmen, and I gloated over it while Xhai fetched a raw-hide rope and leather bucket from a hiding place among the rocks. He brought the bucket up brimming with clear water in which floated a few dead frogs and a drowned bush rat. I made a resolution to boil every drop before it passed my lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren spent a full thirty seconds in admiring the well, before he set off into the narrow valley between the two ridges of granite. I watched him disappear amongst the trees searching diligently, and twenty minutes later his faint shouts drifted up to me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben! Come here! Quickly!’ I dragged myself off the coping of the well and limped down into the valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here it is, Ben.’ Louren was wild with excitement and I was struck again by the power that gold has to quicken the most sluggish pulse, and to put the glitter of avarice in even the most world-weary eye. I am not a materialistic person, but the lure and magic of it quickened my own breathing as I stood beside Louren and we looked upon the mine of the ancients.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not an impressive sight in itself, a shallow depression, a trench sunk about three or four feet below the level of the surrounding earth, its banks gently rounded, it meandered away amongst the trees like a footpath that had been worn into the earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Open stope,’ Louren told me. ‘They followed the strike of the reef.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And back-filled.’ I commented on the peculiar habit that the ancients had of filling in all their workings before abandoning them. This shallow trench was caused by the subsidence of the loose soil with which they had filled it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on,’ said Louren. ‘Let’s follow it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">For a mile and a half we followed the old stope through the forest before it petered out.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If only we could find one of their dumps,’ Louren muttered as we searched the rank vegetation for a pile of loose rock. ‘Or at least a piece of the ore that <span lang="en-US">they overlooked.</span>’</p>

  <p class="normal">My back was hurting so I sat on a fallen log to rest, and left Louren to continue the search. He moved away through the trees leaving me alone, and I could enjoy the sense of history which enveloped me when I was alone in a place such as this.</p>

  <p class="normal">The water level in the well was fifty feet, so I guessed that this was the depth to which the ancients had worked their stope. They did not have the pumps or equipment to evacuate the workings, and as soon as water started pouring in they refilled it and left to find another reef.</p>

  <p class="normal">This mine had been an open trench, one and a half miles long and fifty feet deep by six feet wide, hacked from the earth with adzes of iron and iron wedges pounded into the grain of the rock with stone hammers. When the rock was hard enough to resist this method, then they built fires upon it and poured water mixed with sour wine on the heated surface to shatter it. This was the same method that Hannibal used to break up the boulders that blocked the passage of his elephants across the Alps - a Carthaginian trick, you might call it. From the sheet of reet they prised lumps of gold quartz and packed it into baskets to be hauled to the surface on raw-hide ropes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Using these methods they removed an estimated 700 tons of fine gold from workings spread over 300,000 square miles of central and southern Africa, together with vast quantities of iron and copper and tin.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s 22 million ounces of gold at $40 an ounce, 880 million dollars.’ I worked it out aloud, then added, ‘And that’s a big loaf of bread.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben, where are you?’ Louren was coming back through the trees. ‘I found a piece of the reef.’ He had a lump of rock in his hand and he handed it to me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you make of that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Blue sugar quartz,’ I said. And I licked at it to wet the surface, then held it to catch the sunlight. ‘Wow!’ I exclaimed as the native gold sparkled wetly back at me, filling the cracks and tiny fissures in the quartz like butter in a sandwich.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wow, indeed!’ Louren agreed. ‘This is good stuff. I’ll send a couple of my boys in to peg the whole area.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lo, don’t forget about me,’ I said, and he frowned quickly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ll be cut in on it, Ben. Have I ever tried—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t be a clot, Lo. I didn’t mean that. I just don’t want your rock hounds tearing up the countryside before I’ve had a chance to go over it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, Ben. I promise,’ he laughed. ‘You can be here when we reopen the workings.’ He juggled the lump of quartz in his hand. ‘Let’s get back, I want to pan this and get some idea of its value.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Using one of the stone mortars in the granite cap and a lump of ironstone as a pestle, Louren pounded a piece of the quartz to a fine white powder. This he collected in our cooking pot, and with well-water washed off the powdered stone. Swirling the contents of the pot with an easy circular motion, letting a little spill over the rim of the pot with each turn. It took him fifteen minutes to separate the ‘tail’ of gold. It lay curled around the bottom of the pot, greasy shiny yellow.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Pretty,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They don’t come prettier!’ Louren grinned. ‘This stuff will go five ounces to the ton.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are an avaricious bastard, aren’t you,’ I teased him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Put it this way, Ben,’ he was still grinning, ‘the profits from this will probably keep your Institute running for another twenty years. Don’t kick it, partner, money isn’t the root of all evil if you use it right.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I won’t kick it,’ I promised him.</p>

  <p class="normal">We camped that night beside the well, feasting on boiled elephant tongue and potatoes and keeping a bonfire going to compensate for our lack of blankets. We spent the following morning cutting out the tusks. These we buried beneath a huge pile of rocks to keep off the hyenas, and it was after noon before we started back for the Land-Rover.</p>

  <p class="normal">Night caught us out again, but we reached the Land-Rover in the middle of the following morning. I had blisters on my heels the size of grapes and my lumps and bruises ached abominably. I collapsed thankfully into the passenger seat of the Land-Rover.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Up to this moment I have never truly appreciated the invention of the internal combustion engine,’ I announced gravely. ‘You can take me home now, James.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We left Xhai and his small tribe to their eternal wanderings in the wilderness and we arrived back at the City of the Moon eight days after we left it. We were blackened by the sun and an accumulation of dirt, we had sprouted beards, and our hair was stiff with dust and grime. Louren’s beard came out a burnished red-gold that glistened in the sunlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had been AWOL for three days, and the pack was clamorous. A tall pile of messages waited for him in the radio shack, and before he could shave or bath he had to spend an hour on the radio taking care of the most urgent matters that had arisen in his absence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I should get on back to the salt mines right away,’ he told me as he came out of the shack. ‘It’s four-thirty. I could make it.’ He hesitated a moment, then his resolve hardened. ‘No, damn it! I’m going to steal one more night. Get out the Glen Grant while I take a bath.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Now you are talking sense.’ I laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the way, partner.’ He punched my shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the way, Lo,’ I assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">We talked a lot, and sang a little, and drank whisky until after midnight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bed!’ said Louren then, and rose to go, but suddenly he paused. ‘Ben you promised to let me have some photographs of the “white king” painting to take back with me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure, Lo.’ I stood up a little unsteadily and went through into the office. I took a sheaf of nine-by-six-inch glossy prints from my files and went back with them to Louren. Standing under the light he shuffled through them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s wrong with this one, Ben?’ he asked suddenly, and handed it to me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What? I can’t see anything.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The face, Ben. There is a mark.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I saw it then; a faint shadowy cross which marred the death-white face of the king. I studied it a moment. It puzzled me. I hadn’t noticed it before - like a dark grey hot cross bun.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s probably a flaw in the printing, Lo,’ I guessed. ‘Is it on the others?’ He glanced through the other prints quickly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. Just that one.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I handed it back to him. ‘Just a faulty print,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay.’ Louren accepted my explanation. ‘Goodnight.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I poured myself a nightcap while Sally and the others trooped off after Louren, and I drank it slowly, sitting alone, running over in my mind the plans that Louren and I had formulated for the thorough investigation of the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">I will admit that I never gave the mark on the white king’s face another thought. My excuse is that I was more than a little drunk.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next two months passed swiftly. Ral and I devoted ourselves to a thorough excavation of the floor of the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">The results were surprising only in their paucity. The cavern had never been used for human habitation, there was no midden or hearth level. We found an accumulation of animal detritus that extended down to bed-rock. On the bedrock itself we found a single square block of dressed stone, and that was the total bag.</p>

  <p class="normal">Our excavations had given the cavern a forlorn and gutted appearance, and the bed-rock was uneven limestone, so I had the dig refilled and neatly levelled. Then we used the ancient blocks to lay a pavement around the emerald pool. I saw this as a concession to the convenience of the thousands of future visitors who would come to view this wonderful gallery of bushman art once its existence was known to the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he had promised, Louren radioed me when his company was ready to begin re-opening the ancient mine we had discovered on the hunt for the elephant. A helicopter fetched me and I spent three weeks with the engineers who were doing the work.</p>

  <p class="normal">The reef was there below the water-table as we had hoped, and although its values varied widely from place to place along its length, yet the average was exceptionally high. Secretly I was glad of my ten per cent interest in the mine, despite my non-materialist values. We recovered many hundreds of artefacts, mostly mining tools. There were badly rusted adzes and wedges, stone hammers, scraps of chain, a few well-preserved fibre baskets and the usual beads and pottery.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of these I was most pleased with the fibre baskets which enabled us to obtain a carbon-14 date from the laboratories. This was slightly prior to, if not concurrent with, the date of the great fire, and served to link the elephant mine with the City of the Moon.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, the most interesting find at the elephant mine was that of fifteen human skeletons lying like a string of beads along the stope at its deepest point. The arrangement of the bodies was so regular as to preclude the idea that they may have been killed in a rockfall. Although the skeletons had been flattened by the weight of earth from above, I was able <em>to</em> determine that five of them were female and ten were male. All of them were elderly, and one of them showed traces of arthritis, another had lost an arm between elbow and wrist but the bone had encysted, proving that it had not been a recent injury. Most of them had lost teeth. On all of them I found traces of iron chains, and the picture I had was that of fifteen elderly and infirm slaves laid deliberately along the bottom of the stope before it was filled.</p>

  <p class="normal">After supervising the cataloguing, packing and dispatch to the Institute of all these finds, I returned to the City of the Moon, and I went immediately to the cavern. As I had hoped, Sally was hard at work there. I do not think her pleasure was affected as she came to meet me and kissed me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Ben. I’ve missed you.’ Then she launched immediately into a technical discussion, and while I made the right answers my thoughts were far from bushman paintings.</p>

  <p class="normal">I watched the way she crinkled her nose as she spoke, and the way she kept pushing her hair back from her cheek with the back of her hand, and my whole being throbbed with love of her. Down in my stomach I felt a squirming of dread. Our work at the City of the Moon was almost finished, soon we would be returning to Johannesburg and the hushed halls of the Institute. I wondered how this would affect Sally and me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’ll be leaving soon, Sal.’ I gave expression to my thoughts.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ she agreed, immediately sobered. ‘The thought saddens me. I’ve been so happy here, I’m going to miss it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We sat in silence for a while, then Sally stood up and went to stand before the portrait of the white king. She stared at it moodily, her arms folded tightly across her breast. - ‘We’ve learned so much here,’ she paused for a moment, and then went on, ‘and yet there was so much that was denied us. It was like chasing clouds, often I felt we were so close to having it in our hands.’ She shook her head, angrily. ‘There are so many secrets still locked away from us, Ben. Things we will never know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She turned and came back to where I sat; she knelt in front of me with her hands on her knees, staring into my face.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you know that we haven’t got proof, Ben! Do you realize there is nothing we have found here that can’t be discredited by the old arguments.’ She leaned closer towards me. ‘We have a symbol on a scrap of pottery. Imported in the course of trade, they will say. We have the golden chalice, the work of native goldsmiths using the Ankh motif by chance, they will say. We have the paintings - heresay is not evidence, they will say.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She sat back on her haunches and stared at me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you know what we’ve got, Ben, after it’s all been sifted and sorted? We’ve got a big fat <em>nothing</em>.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know,’ I said miserably.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We haven’t even a single fact to knock them off their smug little perch. Our City of the Moon - our beautiful city -will be simply another culture of obscure Bantu origin, and there isn’t a damn thing we can do about it. We will never know what happened to the great walls and towers, and we will never know where our white king lies buried.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal"><a id="bb"></a>I planned to shut down the dig on the 1st of August, and we spent the last weeks of July tidying it all, leaving the foundations exposed for others who might follow us, packing our treasures with loving care, making the last entries in the piles of notebooks, typing the long lists of catalogues and attending to the hundreds of other finicky details.</p>

  <p class="normal">The field investigation was over, but ahead of me lay months of work, filing and correlating everything we had discovered, fitting each fact into its niche and comparing it with evidence gathered by others at other sites and finally there would be the summation and the book. Months before, I had hoped I might be able to entitle my book <em>The Phoenicians in Southern Africa</em>. Now I would have to find another title.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Dakota arrived to take away the first load of crates, and with it went Peter and Heather Willcox. They would still have two or three months of their European holiday, but we were sorry to see them go, for we had been a happy group.</p>

  <p class="normal">That evening Louren spoke to me over the radio.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have got hold of Cousteau at last, Ben. He’s been cruising in the Pacific but my office in San Francisco spoke with him. He thinks he may be able to help, but there is no chance that he will be able to come before next year. He has a full schedule for the next eight months.’</p>

  <p class="normal">That was my last excuse for staying on at the City of the Moon, and I began packing my own private papers. Sally offered to help me. We worked late, sorting through the thousands of photographs. Now and then we would pause to examine a print of particular interest, or laugh over one that had been taken in fun, remembering the good times we had spent together over the months.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally we came to the file of prints of the white king.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My beautiful mysterious king,’ Sally sighed. ‘Isn’t there anything more you can tell us? Where did you come from? Who did you love? Into what battles did you carry your war shield, and who wept over your wounds when they carried you home from the field?’</p>

  <p class="normal">We went slowly through the thick pile of prints. They were taken from every angle, with every type of variation in lighting, exposure and printing technique.</p>

  <p class="normal">A detail of one of the prints caught my eye. I suppose that subconsciously I was alerted to pick it up. I stared at it, with eyes that began to see for the first time. I felt something fluttering inside of me like a trapped bird, felt the electric tickle run up my arms.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sal,’ I said and then stopped.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it. Ben?’ She picked up the quaver of suppressed excitement in my voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The light!’ I said. ‘Do you remember how we found the city in the moonlight? The angle and the intensity of the light?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ she nodded eagerly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you see it, Sal?’ I touched the white king’s face. ‘Do you remember the print I gave to Lo? Do you remember the mark on it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">She stared at the photograph. It was fainter than on Louren’s print, but it was there, the same shadowy cross shape superimposed upon the death-white face.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’ Sally puzzled, turning the photograph in her hands to catch the light.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know.’ I said as I hurried across the room <em>to</em> the equipment cupboard, and began scratching around in it, ‘but I’m damned well going to find out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I came out of the cupboard and handed her one of the four-cell torches. ‘Take this and follow me, Watson.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We always seem to do our best work at night,’ Sally began, and then realized what she had said. ‘I didn’t mean it that way!’ She forestalled any ribald comment.</p>

  <p class="normal">The cavern was as still as an ancient tomb, and our footsteps echoed loudly off the paving as we skirted the pool and went to the portrait of the white king. The beams of our torches danced upon him and he stared down at us, regal and aloof.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There’s no mark on his face,’ Sally said, and I could hear the disappointment in her voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wait.’ I took my handkerchief from my pocket. Folding it in half, and in half again, I masked the glass of my torch. The bright beam was reduced to a steady glow through the cloth. I climbed up onto the timber framework that had been left in position.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Switch yours off,’ I ordered Sally, and in the semi-darkness I stepped up to the portrait and began examining the face with the dimmer light.</p>

  <p class="normal">The cheek was white, flawless. Slowly I moved the light, lifting higher, lowering it, moving it in a wide circle around the king’s head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There!’ we cried together, as suddenly the hazy mark of the cross appeared over the pale features. I steadied the light in its correct position and examined the mark.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s a shadow, Sal,’ I said. ‘I think there must be an irregularity beneath the paint. A sort of groove, or rather two grooves intersecting each other at right angles to form a cross.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Cracks in the rock?’ Sally asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Perhaps,’ I said. ‘But they seem to be too straight, the angles too precise to be natural.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I unmasked my torch, and turned to her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sal, have you an article of silk with you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Silk?’ She looked stunned, but recovered quickly, ‘My scarf.’ Her ringers went to her throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lend it to me, please.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What are you going to do with it?’ she demanded, holding her hand protectively over the scrap of pretty cloth that showed in the neck of her blouse. ‘It’s genuine Cardin. Cost me a ruddy king’s ransom.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I won’t spoil it,’ I promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ll buy me a new one if you do,’ she warned me, as she unknotted the scarf and passed it up to me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Give a light,’ I requested and she directed her torch onto the king. I spread the scarf over the king’s head, holding it in position with the fingers of my left hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What on earth are you doing?’ she demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If you are ever buying a second-hand car, and you want to be sure it has never been in a smash, then this is the way you feel for blemishes that the eye can’t see.’</p>

  <p class="normal">With the fingertips of my right hand I began feeling the surface of the painting through the silk. The cloth allowed my fingertips to slip easily over the rock, and seemed to magnify the feel of the texture. I found a faint groove, followed it to a crossroads, moved down the south axis to another crossroads, moved east, north, and back to my starting point. My finger-tips had traced a regular oblong shape, measuring about nine by six inches.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you feel anything?’ Sally could not contain her impatience. I did not answer her for my heart was in my mouth, and my fingers were busy, running all over the rock beneath the silk, moving well away from the portrait, down almost to floor level, and up as high as I could reach.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Ben. Do tell me! What is it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wait!’ My heart was drumming like the flight of a startled pheasant, and the track of my fingertips trembled with excitement.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will not wait, damn you,’ she shouted. ‘Tell me!’</p>

  <p class="normal">I jumped down off the framework and grabbed her hand. ‘Come on.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where are we going?’ she demanded as I dragged her across the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘To get the camera.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What on earth for?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We are going to take some photographs.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I had two rolls of Kodak Ektachrome Aero-film type 8443 in the small refrigerated cabinet which housed my stock of films. I had ordered this infra-red film to experiment with photographing the unexcavated foundations of the city from the top of the cliffs, but the results had not been encouraging. There were too many rock strata and too much vegetation confusing the prints.</p>

  <p class="normal">I filled my Rolleiflex with a roll of the infra-red film, and I fitted a Kodak No 12 Wratten filter over the lens. Sally pestered me while I worked, but I replied to all her queries with, ‘Wait and see!’</p>

  <p class="normal">I took up two arc-lights, and we arrived back at the cavern a little alter midnight.</p>

  <p class="normal">I used a direct frontal lighting, plugging the arc-lights into the switchboard of the electric water-pump beside the pool. I set the Rolleiflex on a tripod and made twenty exposures at varying speeds and aperture-settings. By this time Sally was on the point of expiring with curiosity, and I took mercy on her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is the technique they use for photographing canvases and picking out the signatures and details <span lang="en-US">overlaid</span> by layers of other paints, for aerial photography through cloud, for photographing the currents of the sea, things which are invisible to the human eye.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It sounds like magic.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is,’ I said, clicking away busily. The filter takes out everything but the infra-red rays, and the film is sensitive to it. It will reflect any temperature or texture differences in the subject and show them in differing colours.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an hour’s work in the dark room before I could project the images onto our viewing screen. All colours were altered, becoming weird and hellish. The king’s face was a virulent green and his beard purple. There were strange dapplings, speckles, and spots which we had never noticed before. These were irregularities in the surface, extraneous materials in the paint pigments, colonies of lichens and other imperfections. They glowed like outlandish jewels.</p>

  <p class="normal">I hardly noticed these. What held all my attention, and set my pulses pounding, was the grid of regular oblong shapes that <span lang="en-US">underlaid</span> the entire image. An irregular chequer-board effect; they showed in lines of pale blue.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’ve got to get Louren here immediately,’ I blurted.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it? I still don’t understand. What does it mean?’ Sally pleaded, and I turned to her with surprise. It was so clear to me that I had expected her to understand readily.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It means, Sal, that beyond our white king is an opening in the rock wall which has been closed off by a master mason with perfectly laid blocks of sandstone The white king has been painted over it.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Louren Sturvesant stood before the rock wall in the cavern and stared angrily at the white king. His hands were clasped behind his back. He was balanced on the balls of his feet, with his jaw thrust out aggressively. We stood around him in a semicircle, Ral, Sally, Leslie and I, and we watched his face anxiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly Louren tore the cigar out of his own mouth and hurled it onto the paved floor. Savagely he ground the stub to powder, then he swung away and went to the edge of the emerald pool and stared down into its shadowy depths. We waited in silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">He came back, drawn to the painting like a moth to the candle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That thing,’ he said, ‘is one of the world’s great works of art. It’s two thousand years old. It’s irreplaceable. Invaluable.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It doesn’t belong to us. It’s part of our heritage. It belongs to our children, to generations not yet born.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know,’ I said, but I knew more than that. I had watched Louren over the months as his feelings towards the portrait grew. It had developed some deep significance for him, which I could only guess at.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Now you want me to destroy it,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">We were all silent. Louren swung away and began pacing, back and forth, in front of the portrait. All our heads swung to watch him, like spectators at a tennis match. He stopped abruptly, in front of me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You and your fancy bloody photographs,’ he said, and began pacing again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Couldn’t we—’ Leslie began timidly, but her voice faded out as Louren spun around and glared at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes?’ he demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, could you sort of go round behind it, I mean, well—’ Her voice faded and then grew stronger again. ‘Drill a passage in the wall off to one side, and then turn back behind the king?’</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first time in my life I felt like throwing my arms around her neck and kissing her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren flew up one of his mine captains with a crack team of five Mashona rock-breakers from the Little Sister gold mine near Welcome. They brought with them an air-compressor, pneumatic drills, jumper bars, and all the other paraphernalia of their trade. The mine captain was a big, ginger-haired man, with cheerful cornflower-blue eyes, and a freckled baby face. His name was Tinus van Vuuren, and he threw himself wholeheartedly into the project.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Reckon we will be able to cut her fairly easy. Doctor, This sandstone is like cheese, after the serpentine and quartz that I am used to.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I want the smallest opening you can work in,’ Sally told him sternly. ‘I want as little damage as possible done to the paintings.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Man,’ Tinus turned to her earnestly. ‘I’ll cut you one no bigger than a mouse’s—’ he cut the word off, and substituted another, ‘—ear-hole.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally and I taped the outline of the mouth of the shaft on the wall of the cavern. We positioned it carefully to avoid the most beautiful and significant paintings. Though we took Tinus at his word and made the opening a mere two feet wide by four high - yet we would destroy part of a lovely group of giraffe, and a dainty little gazelle with big listening ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">We kept thirty feet away from the white king, to avoid undue vibrations from the drills which may have loosened flakes of stone or paint pigments. Tinus would go in for thirty feet, then turn his shaft at right angles to the face and cut in behind the king. Tinus was set to begin first thing the following morning, but that night we entertained him in the common room. The atmosphere was similar to that of a fighter squadron mess on the eve of a dangerous sortie. We were all voluble and tense, and all of us were drinking a little too much.</p>

  <p class="normal">To begin with, Tinus was very reserved, clearly overawed by the company of the legendary Louren Sturvesant, but the brandy loosened him up and he joined in the conversation.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you want the respirators for, Doc?’ he asked. ‘You expecting gas or a fire?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Respirators?’ Louren broke off a private conversation with Sally. ‘Who ordered respirators?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They specially told me six respirators.’ Tinus looked dismayed at Louren’s direct questioning. ‘They told me that, sir.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s right, Lo.’ I rescued the poor man. ‘I asked for them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, Lo. What we are all hoping to find is a passage, a—’ I was about to say tomb, but I did not want to tempt the gods,‘—cave of some sort.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He nodded. They were all watching me - and with a receptive audience I can seldom resist a touch of the theatrical.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That cave will have been sealed, airtight, for two thousand years or so, which means there could be a danger of—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The Curse of the Pharaohs!’ Sally interjected. ‘Of course, do you remember what happened to the men who first entered Tutankhamen’s tomb?’ She drew a finger across her own throat and rolled her eyes horribly. She was onto her second Glen Grant.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sally, you ought to know better,’ I cut in severely. ‘The Curse of the Pharaohs is of course a myth. But there is a danger of a peculiarly unpleasant lung disease.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I must say, I don’t believe in curses and all that sort of bulldust,’ Tinus laughed, a little too loudly. His inhibitions were way down around his ankles.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That makes two of us,’ agreed Ral Davidson.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s not a supernatural thing,’ Leslie told them primly. ‘It’s a fungus disease.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I seemed to have lost control of the situation completely, so I raised my voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If you are all finished, I’ll go on,’ which got their attention back to me. ‘The conditions would have been ideal for the development of <em>cryptococcus newomyces</em>, a fungoid saphrophitic growth whose airborne spores are the cause of a fatal disease.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What does it do?’ Tinus asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The spores are breathed into the lungs, and in the warm moist conditions they germinate almost immediately and develop into dense granulitic colonies.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sies!’ said Tinus, which is an expression of the deepest disgust. ‘You mean it starts growing on your lungs like that green stuff on mouldy bread?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What are the consequences?’ Louren asked</p>

  <p class="normal">I had it word perfect. ‘Primarily they are extensive lesions of the lung tissue, with haemorrhage, high temperature and rapidly painful breathing, but then the fungoid colonies begin generating wastes which are readily absorbed into the blood and carried to the brain and central nervous system.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My God!’ Tinus was blanched and horrified, his blue eyes stared out of the white freckled face. ‘Then what happens?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, the wastes act as a virulent neurotoxin and induce hallucination. There is inflammation of the meninges, and severe brain malfunction, similar to the effects of lysergic acid or mescalin.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Groovy!’ said Ral, and Leslie kicked his shin.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You mean it drives you crazy?’ Tinus demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Clean out of your little skull,’ Sally assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fatal?’ asked Louren.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Seventy-five per cent, depending on individual immunity and the rate of antibody formation.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In the event of survival, is there permanent damage?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Scarring of the lungs similar to healed tuberculosis.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Brain damage?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ I shook my head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hell, man,’ said Tinus carefully, setting his glass down. ‘I don’t know that I am so keen on this deal. Rock falls, methane gas, pressure bursts - those don’t worry me. But this fungus thing,’ he shuddered, ‘it is creepy, man. Just plain bloody creepy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What precautions are you going to take, Ben?’ Louren asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The first party in will be protected by respirators.’ I explained. ‘I will take air and dust samples for microscopic examination.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren nodded, and smiled at Tinus.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Satisfied?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What will you do if you don’t find it - but it’s sort of lurking there? Like, ready to pounce, you know. Like in those science fiction books,’ Tinus hedged.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If it’s there, it will be thick. Every dust sample will be full of it. You can’t miss it under the microscope. A black, three-ball structure like a pawnbroker’s sign.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you sure, Doc?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sure, Tinus.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He took a deep breath, hesitated a moment longer, then nodded, ‘Okay, Doc. I’ll trust you,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The buffeting, fluttering roar of the rock drills chased my agonized brain into a corner of my skull and started kicking it to a jelly. The party had ended in the early hours.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How are you feeling, Doc?’ Tinus van Vuuren came across to where I stood watching the work and shouted above the din. My nerves vibrated like guitar strings. Tinus looked as fresh and baby-faced as though his night cap had been hot milk and honey and he had slept twelve hours. I knew the type - Louren was one of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I feel bloody awful, thanks,’ I shouted back.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There won’t be anything to see here for a couple of days,’ Tinus told me. ‘Why don’t you go lie down for a bit, Doc.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll stick around,’ I said, which seemed to be the general sentiment. Louren piloted the course of the Sturvesant empire from the radio shack, unable to tear himself away from the City of the Moon. Sally made a few desultory attempts at cataloguing and filing, but these never lasted more than an hour or two and then she was back at the cavern. Ral and Leslie made no pretence, and spent all day in the cavern, except for brief simultaneous absences which Louren and I guessed were exercise periods.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tinus was a top man in his trade, and his team cut the tunnel swiftly and skilfully. The walls were shaped smoothly and precisely. They were shored with heavy timbers baulks, and electric lights were strung along the roof. Thirty feet in, Tinus constructed a large chamber from which a new drive was made, aimed at the area behind the painting of the white king.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tinus and I had made careful measurements and calculations, and we had decided exactly where we could expect to strike whatever the wall of masonry concealed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Bantu drill-men were warned of the need for respirators, and Tinus and I crouched behind them in the cramped rock tunnel as they began the assault on the last few feet of rock. Their backs were naked glistening bunches of black muscles as they worked the heavy drills. The noise in the confined space was thunderous, and despite the ventilation fans circulating air, the heat was appalling. The sweat poured down inside the face mask of my respirator, and the eye goggles were fogged and blurry.</p>

  <p class="normal">The tension was becoming almost painful as the long steel bit of the drill hammered itself into the rock, sinking in inch by inch, the muddy lubricating water running back from the drill hole. I glanced sideways at Tinus. He appeared monstrous in the black rubber mask, but the blue eyes twinkled out of the eye glasses and he winked and held up a thumb in a gesture of assurance.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly the drill-man was thrown off balance, as the drill ran away with him. It slid, unresisted, into its hole, and he staggered wildly as he tried to control the enormous weight of steel. Tinus slapped his shoulder, and he slammed the valve of the drill closed. The silence was almost painful, and our laboured breathing was the only sound.</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Through, I</em> thought, <em>we’ve holed through into God knows what</em>.</p>

  <p class="normal">I saw my own excitement reflected in Tinus’s blue eyes. I nodded at him, and he turned and tapped the drill-men’s shoulders and jerked his thumb in a gesture of dismissal. They shuffled back, bowed in the low tunnel, and disappeared around the bend.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two of us went forward and crouched at the face. Gingerly we withdrew the drill steel from its hole, and a wisp of fine dust followed it out, smoking in the harsh glare of the electric lights. Tinus and I exchanged glances. Then I jerked my head at Tinus. He nodded, and followed his gang back along the tunnel. I worked on alone at the face.</p>

  <p class="normal">I used the long plastic rod, with a piece of sterile white cloth attached to the end of it, to probe the drill hole to its limit. It ran fourteen feet into the rock before meeting resistance, and when I withdrew it the cloth was thick with grey floury dust. I dropped it into the sample bottle, and attached another cloth to the rod. In all I collected six separate samples, before I followed Tinus back along the passage. There was a bench and an angle-poise lamp set up ready for me in the rock chamber. The microscope was under the light, with its mirror adjusted and it was the work of only a few minutes to smear my dust samples onto the slides and spread the red dye over them.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was difficult to get a view into the eyepiece of the micro-scope through my befogged goggles. One quick scrutiny was sufficient, but I doggedly inspected all six samples before I ripped off my respirator and sucked big relieved breaths. Then I scampered down the passage and out into the cavern. They were all waiting for me, crowding around me eagerly. ‘We’ve drilled into a cavity,’ I shouted, ‘and it’s clean!’ Then they were on me, pounding my back and shaking my hand, laughing and chattering excitedly.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Louren would let no one else work with me at the face, though Ral and Sally were clearly breaking their hearts to do so.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two of us worked carefully, slowly chipping away at the drill hole with chisel and four-pound hammer, enlarging it gradually until we had exposed a slab of dressed masonry. It was a massive slab of red sandstone which blocked off the end of our tunnel from floor to roof, and from wall to wall. It was obviously the lining of the cavity into which the drill had bored.</p>

  <p class="normal">The drill hole cut through the centre of it like a single black eye-socket. All our efforts to peer through it were rewarded with a vista of impenetrable blackness and we had to content ourselves with the slower painstaking approach.</p>

  <p class="normal">For three days we worked shoulder to shoulder, stripped to the waist, chipping steadily at the living rock until, despite our gloves, our hands were mushy with blisters and smeared skin. Slowly we exposed the massive slab over its full width and height, to find that it butted on either side against identical slabs and that it appeared to carry across its summit the cross-pieces of an equally massive stone lintel.</p>

  <p class="normal">We used two fifty-ton hydraulic jacks to take the strain of the lintel off the slab. Then we drilled and attached ring bolts to the slab itself and hooked steel chains to them. We jammed a brace of steel H-sections across the tunnel to anchor the chains and with two heavy ratchet winches we began to haul the slab bodily out of its seating.</p>

  <p class="normal">We knelt side by side, each of us straining against one of the winches, taking up the pull one pawl at a time. With each click of the ratchet the strain on the chains increased until they were as rigid as solid steel bars. Now the handles of the winches were almost immovable.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, Ben. Let’s both get onto one of them,’ Louren panted. His golden curls were dark and heavy with sweat and dirt, plastered against his skull, and the sweat highlighted his great shoulder muscles and the straining, swollen biceps as we heaved together at the winch.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Clank! ’ went the rachet and the chain moved a sixteenth of an inch.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Clank!’ Again she moved. Our breathing hissed and whistled in the silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the way, partner,’ Louren gasped beside me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the way, Lo.’ And my body arched like a drawn bow, I felt the muscles in my back begin to tear, my eyes strained from their sockets.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then with a soft grating sound the great slab of sandstone swung slowly out of the face, and then fell with a heavy thump to the floor of the tunnel, and beyond it we saw the square black opening.</p>

  <p class="normal">We lay together side by side, fighting for breath, sweat trickling down our faces and bodies, our muscles still quivering and twitching from our exertions and we stared into that sinister hole.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a smell; a stale, long-dead, dry smell as the air that had been trapped in there for 2,000 years gushed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come!’ Louren was the first to move, he scrambled to his feet and snatched up one of the electric bulbs in its little wire cage, the extension cable slithered after him like a snake as he went forward. I followed him quickly, and we crawled through the opening.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a jump of four feet down to the floor of the chamber beyond. We stood side by side, Louren holding the light above his head, and we peered around us into the moving mysterious shadows.</p>

  <p class="normal">We were in a long commodious passage that ran straight and undeviatingly 155 feet from the cavern end to terminate against a blank wall of stone. The passage was eight foot six inches high, and ten foot wide.</p>

  <p class="normal">The roof was lined with lintels of sandstone laid horizontally from wall to wall, and the walls themselves were tiled with blocks similar to the one we had removed from its seating. The floor was paved with square flags of sandstone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Let into the walls on each side of the passage were stone-lined cupboards. These were seven feet wide and five feet deep and reached from floor to roof height. Each of these recesses was fitted with shelves of stone slab, rank upon rank of them, three feet apart and upon the shelves stood hundreds upon hundreds of pottery jars.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s some sort of store room,’ Louren said, holding the light high and moving slowly down the passage.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, probably wine or corn in the jars.’ I have never learned not to guess aloud. My heart was hammering with excitement and my head swivelled from side to side, as I tried to take in every detail.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were twenty of these recesses, ten on each side of the passage, and I guessed again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Must be two or three thousand pots,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s open one,’ Louren was consumed by a layman’s impatience.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Lo, we can’t do that until we are ready to work properly.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a thick soft shroud of pale dust over everything, it softened the outlines and edges of all shapes. It rose lazily around our legs like a sea mist as our movements stirred it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will have to clean up before we can do anything else,’ I said, and sneezed as the dust found its way into my nostrils.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Move slowly,’ Louren told me. ‘Don’t stir it up.’ He took a further pace and then stopped.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s this?’ Scattered along the passage floor were dozens of large shapeless objects, their identity concealed by the blanketing dust. They were lying singly, or in heaps, strange fluid shapes that teased my memory. Compared with the orderly ranks of jars on their shelves, the objects were strewn with a careless abandon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hold the lamp,’ I told Louren, and crouched over one of them. I touched it gently, running my fingers through the velvety dust, brushing it softly aside until I recognized what it was and I drew back with an involuntary exclamation of surprise.</p>

  <p class="normal">Through the soft mist of dust and ages a face stared up at me. A long-dead, mummified face over which was stretched dry tobacco-brown skin. The eyes were empty dark holes, and the lips had dried and shrunken to expose the grinning yellow teeth.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dead men,’ Louren said. ‘Dozens of them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sacrifices?’ I pondered. ‘No, this is something else.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It looks like a battle As though they have been killed in a fight.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Now that we knew what they were, it was possible to make out the way the bodies were piled upon each other like the debris of a hurricane, or were thrown loosely about the stone floor. A corpse in a mantle of grey dust sat with his back to the wall, his head sagged forward on his chest, and one out-flung arm had knocked four of the jars from their shelf - they lay on the floor beside him like fat rolls of French bread.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It must have been a hell of a fight,’ I said with awe.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It was,’ said Louren softly, and I turned to him with surprise. His eyes glowed with some intense inner excitement, and his lips were parted, a reckless half smile on his lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you mean?’ I demanded. ‘How do you know that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren looked at me For a second or two he did not see me, then his eyes focused.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey?’ he said, puzzled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why did you say that, as though you knew?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did I?’ he asked. ‘I don’t know. I meant - it must have been.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He moved on slowly down the passage, stepping over the wind-rows of dead men, peering in each recess as he passed, and I followed him slowly. My mind was thrashing around like a corralled bull, charging madly at each fleeting idea that crossed its path, spinning back on its track and charging again. I knew there was no chance of it being capable of calm, logical thought until this first surging excitement waned.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of one thing, and one thing only, I was certain. This was big. This was something to rank with Leakey’s discoveries at Olduvai Gorge, something to startle and dazzle the world of archaeology. Something that I had prayed for and dreamed about for twenty years.</p>

  <p class="normal">We had reached the end of the passage. The end wall was another panel of sandstone, but this was decorated. A swirling, stylized engraving of the sun image. Three feet in diameter, it looked like a Catherine wheel with the rays radiating from its circumference. The image evoked in me a strange sense of reverential awe, a hushed feeling of the spirit such as I experience sometimes in a synagogue or the cloisters of a Christian cathedral. Louren and I stood and stared at the image for a long time, then suddenly he turned and looked back to the bricked-in wall 155 feet away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is that all?’ he asked, and there was an irritable tone to his voice. ‘Just this passage and pots and old bones? There must be something more!’</p>

  <p class="normal">It came as a shock to me to realize that he was actually disappointed. For me the universe could hold no richer prize, this was the culminating moment of my life - and Louren was disappointed. I felt anger start to hiss and bubble within me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What the hell do you want?’ I demanded, ‘Gold and diamonds and ivory sarcophagi and—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Something like that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You don’t even know what we’ve got here yet, and already it’s not enough.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben, I didn’t say that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know what’s wrong with you, Louren Sturvesant? You’re bloody well spoiled. You’ve got everything, so nothing is good enough for you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Now, listen here!’ I saw my own anger reflected in his eyes, but I rushed on regardlessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ve planned and saved and worked for this all my life. And now I achieve it, and what do you do?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, Ben!’ I saw comprehension in his eyes suddenly, ‘I didn’t mean it that way. I’m not knocking your achievement. I really think it’s the most incredible discovery ever made in Africa, I was just—’</p>

  <p class="normal">It took him a few minutes of hard talking to mollify me, but at last I grinned reluctantly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay.’ I relented, ‘just don’t go saying things like that, Lo. All my life the bastards have been putting down my discoveries and theories, so don’t you start!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘One thing they’ll never be able to say about you is that you’re frightened to speak your mind!’ He punched my shoulder lightly. ‘Come on, Ben, let’s see what we’ve got in these pots.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We shouldn’t disturb them, Lo.’ I was ashamed of my outburst now, and eager to make it up to him. ‘Not until we have mapped and charted—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A couple of them are lying on the floor, knocked off the shelves,’ Louren pointed. ‘There are thousands of the bloody things. We will just snaffle one of them. Hell, Ben, it won’t do that much harm!’</p>

  <p class="normal">He was not asking permission, not Louren Sturvesant, he was merely giving an order in the pleasantest possible fashion. Already he was making his way back to where the jars were lying beside the dusty bowed corpse, and I hurried after him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay,’ I agreed unnecessarily, in an attempt to keep nominal control of my find. ‘We will remove one of them only ’ I felt a sneaking sense of relief that the wrong decision had been made for me. I was also in a fever of impatience to find out what was in the jars.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The jar stood in the centre of the workshop bench in our prefabricated warehouse. Night had fallen outside, but the overhead lights were all on. We stood around the bench, Sally, Ral, Leslie and I. Tinus van Vuuren was still up at the cavern, his status having changed from mine captain to night-watchman. Louren had decided to place a twenty-four-hour armed guard over the entrance to the tunnel, and Tinus was it - until we could get others.</p>

  <p class="normal">Through the thin partition walls of the hut I could hear Louren’s voice as he shouted into the microphone of the radio.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A vacuum cleaner. <em>Vacuum cleaner</em>. VACUUM CLEANER! V for Venereal, A for Alcoholic - that’s <em>right</em>. Vacuum cleaner. You know the heavy-duty model for cleaning factories. Two of them. Have you got that? Good! Now I want you to get on to Robeson, Head of Security at Sturvesant Diamond Mines. He is to send me his two best men, with half a dozen Bantu guards. Yes, that’s right. Yes, I want them armed.’</p>

  <p class="normal">None of us paid attention to Louren’s voice, we were all staring in mesmerized fascination at the earthenware jar.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, it’s not filled with gold.’ Ral was certain. ‘Not heavy enough.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nor is it liquid - not wine or oil,’ Leslie agreed. And we relapsed into silence. The pot was about eighteen inches high, and thick around as a pickle jar. It was of unglazed red pottery, without inscription or ornamentation, and the lid was like that of a teapot with a small knob for a handle. It was sealed with a layer of black substance, probably gum or wax.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get that lot on the Dakota first thing tomorrow morning, do you hear?’ Louren was still busy next door.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I wish he’d hurry up!’ Sally stirred impatiently. ‘I’m dying to find out what it is.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly I was afraid. I didn’t want to know - I didn’t want to find the jar filled with African millet or some other indigenous grain. I could hear my critics howling like wolves out there in the wilderness. Suddenly I was doubting my own premonition of some momentous discovery and I sat on the edge of my stool, miserably rubbing my grimy hands together and staring at the jar. Perhaps Louren was right, perhaps we would echo his cry, ‘Is that all?’</p>

  <p class="normal">From the radio shack we heard Louren’s voice end the transmission, and he came through into the warehouse. He was still filthy from the work in the tunnel, and his golden hair was stiff with dust and dried sweat. Yet the grime and unruly curls gave him an air of romance, the jaunty look of an old-time pirate. He stood in the doorway with his thumbs hooked into his belt, and all our attention was on him. He grinned at me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, Ben. What have you got for us?’ he asked and sauntered across the room to stand behind my shoulder. Instinctively the others drew closer, crowding into a circle around me and I picked up the surgical scalpel and touched the point of it to the joint of the lid.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first touch told me that my guess had been correct.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bee’s wax, I think.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Carefully I scraped it away, then laid the scalpel aside and gently tried the lid. It came away with surprising ease.</p>

  <p class="normal">All heads craned forward, but the first view of the contents was disappointing. An amorphous mass of substance that was stained dirty yellow-brown by time.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’ Louren demanded of his experts, but none of us could answer him. I was not sure whether to be disappointed or relieved. It certainly wasn’t corn.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It smells,’ said Sally. There was a faintly unpleasant, but familiar odour.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know that smell,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ agreed Leslie.</p>

  <p class="normal">We stared at the pot trying to place it. Then suddenly I remembered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It smells like a tannery works.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s it!’ agreed Sally.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Leather?’ asked Louren.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s see,’ I said, and carefully tipped the jar onto its side with the mouth facing me. Gently I began easing the contents out of the jar. It became immediately clear that it held something cylindrical in shape and of a hard, brittle texture.</p>

  <p class="normal">It seemed to have stuck to the inside of the jar, but I twisted carefully and with a faint rending sound it was loose. I inched it out of the jar, and as it emerged, there was a running commentary from the watchers.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s a long round thing.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Looks like a polony sausage.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s wrapped in cloth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Linen, I hope!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s woven anyway. That will take some explaining away as Bantu culture!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The cloth is rotten, it’s falling away in patches.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I laid it on the table, and as I stared at it I knew all my dreams had become reality. <em>I knew what it was</em>. A treasure beyond all the gold and diamonds Louren had hoped for. I looked up quickly at Sally to see if she had guessed, her expression was eager but puzzled. Then her eyes met mine and my jubilation must have been obvious.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben!’ She guessed then. ‘It isn’t? Oh, Ben, it couldn’t be! Open it, man! For God’s sake, open it!’</p>

  <p class="normal">I took up a pair of tweezers, but my hands were too unsteady to work. I clenched my fists, and drew a couple of deep breaths to try and calm the racing of my blood and the pounding of it in my ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here, let me do it,’ said Ral, and reached to take the tweezers from my grip.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No!’ I snatched my hand away. I think I would have struck him if he had persisted. I saw the shock on Ral’s face, he had never before seen the violence that lurks in my depths.</p>

  <p class="normal">They all waited until I had got control of my hands again. Then carefully I began to peel the wrappings of brittle yellow cloth from the cylinder. I saw it appear from under the wrappings, and there were no more doubts. I heard Sally’s little gasp from across the bench, but I did not look up until it was done.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben!’ she whispered, ‘I’m so happy for you,’ And I saw that she was crying, big fat tears sliding slowly down her cheeks. This was what triggered me, I am certain that if she hadn’t started it I would have been all right, but suddenly my own eyes were burning and my vision blurred with moisture.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thanks, Sal,’ I said, and my voice was soggy and nasal. When I felt the droplets start to spill on to my cheeks I struck them away with an angry hand, and groped for my handkerchief. I blew my nose like a bugler sounding the charge, and my heart sang as loudly.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a tightly rolled cylindrical scroll of leather. The outer edges of the scroll were tattered and eaten by decomposure. The rest of it, however, was miraculously preserved. There were lines of writing running like columns of little black insects along the length of the scroll. I recognized the symbols immediately, identifying the individual letters of the Punic alphabet. It was written in a flowing Punic script, of which the first thirty lines were exposed on the roll of ancient leather. The language was not one I understood, but I looked up at Sally again. This was her speciality, she had worked with Hamilton at Oxford.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sal, can you read it? What is it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s Carthaginian,’ she spoke with complete certainty. ‘Punic!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you sure?’ I demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">In reply she read aloud in a voice that was still choked up and muffled with tears, ‘<em>Into Opet this day a caravan from the</em>.’ she hesitated, ‘that piece is obscure but it goes on, <em>In fingers of fine gold one hundred and twenty-seven pieces, of which a tenth part unto</em>—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What the hell is going on?’ Louren demanded. ‘What does all this mean?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I turned to him. ‘It means we have found the archives of our city - completely intact and decipherable. We have the whole written history of our city, of our dead civilization, written by the people themselves in their own language. Their own words.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren was staring at me. It was clear that the significance of our discovery had not yet occurred to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This, Lo, is what every archaeologist prays for. This is proof in its most absolute form, in its most detailed and elaborate form.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He still didn’t seem to understand.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In one line of writing we have proved conclusively the existence of a people who spoke and wrote the ancient Punic of Carthage, who traded gold, who called their city Opet, who—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And that’s only in one line of writing,’ Sally interrupted. ‘There are thousands of jars, each with its scroll of writings. We will know the names and deeds of their kings, their religion, their ceremonial—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Their battles and strivings, where they came from and when.’ I took the verbal ball from Sally, but just as adroitly she snatched it back.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And where they went to and why!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My God!’ Louren understood at last. ‘This is everything we’ve been looking for, Ben. It’s the whole bloody shebang and shooting-match rolled into one!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The works!’ I agreed. ‘The whole ruddy lot!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Within an hour of my triumph, right at the zenith of my career when nothing but the prospect of fame and brilliant success lay ahead of me, Dr Sally Benator managed to bring it all crashing down around me.</p>

  <p class="normal">We were sitting in the same tight circle around the scroll, still talking eagerly, one of those talk sessions which could only end in the early morning, for already the Glen Grant bottle was out and all our throats were oiled, the words pouring out smoothly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally had translated all the writing visible on the scroll. It was an accounting of trade into the city, a cataloguing of goods and values that in itself held intriguing references to places and peoples.</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>‘Twenty large amphora of the red wines of Zeng, taken by Habbakuk Lal of which a tenth part to the Gry-Lion.’</em></p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s a gry-lion?’ Louren’s hunter’s instincts were roused.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Gry is a superlative,’ Sally explained. ‘So a gry-lion is a great lion. Probably a title of the king or governor of the city.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘<em>From the grass seas of the south one hundred and ninety-two large tusks of ivory in all two-hundred and twenty-one talents in weight of which a tenth part to the Gry-Lion and the balance outwards on the bireme of Al-Muab Adbm</em>.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How much is a talent?’ Louren asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘About 56 pounds avoirdupois.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My God, that’s over 10,000 lb of ivory, in one load,’ Louren whistled. ‘They must have been great little hunters.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We had discussed in detail every line of exposed writing, and again Louren’s impatience came to the surface.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s unroll a little more,’ he suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s a job for an expert, Lo.’ I shook my head regretfully. ‘That leather has been rolled up for nearly 2,000 years. It’s so dry and brittle it will fall to pieces if it isn’t done correctly.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ Sally agreed with me. ‘It will take me weeks to do each one.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Her presumption left me flabbergasted. Her practical knowledge of palaeography and ancient writings was limited to three years as a third assistant to Hamilton. I doubted if she had actually done much work on preservation and preparation of leather or papyrus scrolls. She could read Punic with about the same aplomb as the average ten-year-old can read Shakespeare, and she was taking it for granted that she would be placed in sole control of one of the greatest hoards of ancient writings ever discovered.</p>

  <p class="normal">She must have read my expression, for her own alarm showed clearly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I <em>am</em> to do the work, aren’t I, Ben?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I tried to make it easier for her, I do not like hurting anyone, let alone the girl I love.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s an enormous and difficult job, Sal. I really think we should try and get someone like Hamilton himself, or Levy from Tel Aviv, even Rogers from Chicago.’ I saw her face starting to fall to pieces, the lips drooping and trembling, the eyes clouding, and I went on hurriedly. ‘But I’m sure we can arrange for you to become first assistant to whoever does the work.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a deadly silence for five seconds, and during that time Sally’s despair changed swiftly to a blind all-consuming rage. I saw it coming like a build-up of storm clouds but I was powerless to divert it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Benjamin Kazin,’ she began with deceptive softness of voice, ‘I think you are the most unmitigated bastard it has ever been my misfortune to meet. For three long difficult years I have given you my complete and unswerving loyalty—’</p>

  <p class="normal">Then she lost control and it was a splendid spectacle. Even while her words lashed my soul raw and bleeding I could still admire the flashing eyes, the flushing cheeks and the masterly choice of invective.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are a <em>little</em> man, in mind as well as body.’ She used the adjective deliberately, and I gasped. No one should ever call me that, it is a word that eats away the fabric of my soul and she knew it. ‘I hate you. I hate you, you <em>little</em> man.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I felt the blood rush to my face, and I stuttered, trying to find the words to defend myself, but before I could do so Sally had turned on Louren. Her rage still blazed, her tone was not moderated in the least as she shouted at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Make him give it to me. Tell him to do it!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Even in my own distress I felt alarm for poor Sally. This wasn’t a crippled, soft-hearted little doctor of archaeology she was talking to now. This was like prodding a black mamba with a short stick, or throwing stones at a man-eating lion. I could not believe that Sally would be so stupid, would presume so upon the mildly friendly attitude which Louren had shown to her. I could not believe that she would dare that tone with Louren, as though she had some special right to his consideration, as though there was some involvement of emotions or of loyalties which she could call upon in such imperious terms. Even I who had such rights would never misuse them in such a fashion, I knew no one else who would.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren’s eyes flashed cold blue light, like the glinting of spear-heads. His lips drew into grim lines, and the rims of his nostrils flared and turned pale as bone china.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Woman!’ His voice crackled like breaking ice. ‘Hold your tongue.’</p>

  <p class="normal">If it were possible then my despair plunged even deeper as Louren responded precisely as I had expected. Now the two persons I loved were on a collision course, and I knew each of them so well, knew their pride and pig-headedness, that neither would deviate. Disaster was certain, inevitable.</p>

  <p class="normal">I wanted to cry out to Sally, ‘Don’t, please don’t. I’ll do what you ask. Anything to prevent this happening.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And Sally’s bravado collapsed. All the fight and anger went out of her. She seemed to cringe beneath the lash of Louren’s voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Go to your room and stay there until you learn how to behave,’ Louren gave the order in the same coldly furious tone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally stood up and with eyes downcast she left the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">I could not believe it had happened. I gaped at the door through which she had gone - my saucy, rebellious Sally - as meekly as a chastened child. Ral and Leslie were writhing in a sea of agonized embarrassment.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bedtime, I think,’ Ral muttered ‘Please excuse us. Come, Les. Goodnight all.’ And they were gone, leaving Louren and me alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren broke the long silence. He stood up as he spoke in an easy natural voice. His hand dropped on my shoulder in a casually affectionate gesture.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sorry about that, Ben. Don’t let it worry you. See you in the morning.’ And he strolled out into the night.</p>

  <p class="normal">I sat alone with my suddenly worthless roll of old leather, and my breaking heart.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hate you, you <em>little</em> man!’ Her voice echoed through the lonely wastes of my soul, and I reached for the Glen Grant bottle.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took me a long time to get completely drunk, to the stage where the words had lost some of their sting, and when I staggered down the steps into the bright silver moonlight, I knew what I was going to do. I was going to apologize to Sally, and let her do the work. Nothing was important enough to warrant her displeasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">I went to the hut where Sally now slept alone. Leslie had moved into Peter and Heather’s old room. I scratched softly on the door, and there was no reply from within. I knocked louder, and called her name.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sally! Please, I must talk to you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">At last I tried the door, and it opened into the darkened room. I almost went on in, but then my courage deserted me. I closed the door softly, and staggered to my own hut. I fell face down across the bed, and still dirty and fully dressed I found oblivion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben! Ben! Wake up.’ Sally’s voice and her hand shaking me gently but insistently. I turned my head and opened my burning eyes. It was bright morning. Sally sat on the edge of my bed, leaning over me. She was fully dressed, and although her skin glowed from the bath and her hair was freshly brushed and gay with a scarlet ribbon, yet her eyes were puffy and swollen as though she had slept badly, or had been crying.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ve come to apologize for last night, Ben. For the stupid, hateful things I said, and my disgusting behaviour—’ As she talked the shattered pieces of my life fell back into place, and the pain in my head and heart abated.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Even though you’ve probably changed your mind, and I don’t deserve it anyway, I’d be honoured to act as first assistant to Hamilton or whoever does the work.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ve got the job.’ I grinned at her, ‘That’s a promise.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Our first task at the archives was to clean away the thick accumulation of grey dust that blanketed everything. I was puzzled as to the source of this dust in a sealed and airless space like the passage, but I soon found that the joints of the roof lintels were not as tight as those of the walls, and during the centuries a fine sprinkling of dust had filtered down through these cracks.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the equipment which Louren had ordered arrived on the Dakota, along with a detachment of Louren’s security police, we could begin the work.</p>

  <p class="normal">The security police set up a hut at the entrance to the tunnel, where there was a permanent guard posted. Only the five of us were allowed to enter.</p>

  <p class="normal">The vacuum equipment simplified the removal of dust from the archives. Ral and I worked from the outer end of the passage like a pair of busy housewives, and the suffocating clouds of grey dust made it necessary to wear respirators until the job was finished.</p>

  <p class="normal">We were then able to assess our discovery more accurately. There were 1,142 sealed jars of pottery in the stone recesses. Of these 148 had been knocked from their niches and 127 were broken or cracked, with their scrolls exposed to the air and obviously much the worse for it- These we sprayed with paraffin wax to prevent them crumbling, before lifting, labelling and packing them.</p>

  <p class="normal">We then turned our full attention to the evidence of the deadly battle that had raged through the archives, and wrought the damage to the shelves of jars.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were thirty-eight corpses strewn down the passage between the shelves in all the abandoned attitudes of sudden and violent death, and their state of preservation was quite remarkable. A few of them had crawled away into the recesses to die, groaning out their last breaths, and clutching the terrible wounds that still gaped in their mummified bodies Their dying agonies were clearly stamped into their contorted features. Others had died swiftly, and most of these had received hideous wounds that had severed limbs, or split their skulls down to the shoulders, or, in a few cases, had struck the head clean from the trunk and sent it rolling yards away.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was evidence here of a diabolical fury, the unleashing of an almost superhuman destructive strength.</p>

  <p class="normal">All the victims were clearly negroid in type, and wore loincloths or aprons of tanned leather, with beadwork or bone decorations. On their feet were light leather sandals, and on their heads caps or head-dresses of leather, feathers or plaited fibre also decorated with beads, shells or bones.</p>

  <p class="normal">Around them were strewn their weapons; crudely forged iron spear-heads bound on shafts of polished hardwood. Many of these shafts were broken, or severed by the blows of some razor-sharp weapons. With them lay hundreds of reed arrows, fledged with the feathers of wild duck and tipped with wickedly barbed heads of hand-forged iron. The arrows had nicked and chipped the soft sandstone walls, and it was easy to determine that they had been fired from outside the mouth of the passage before it had been sealed off. Not one of them had found a mark in a human body, and so we reasoned that a barrage of arrows had preceded the attack by these men who lay scattered in death down the length of the passage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Fifteen feet from the sealed mouth of the passage there was evidence of a large bonfire which had blackened the walls, roof and floor around it. A pile of charred logs still lay where the lack of air had stifled the fire when the mouth of the tunnel was sealed. This fire puzzled us until Louren reconstructed the battle for us. He paced restlessly back and forth along the passage, his footsteps ringing on the stone slabs, his shadow falling grotesque and monstrous on the stone walls.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They drove them into this place, the last of our men of Opet, a small party of the strongest and the bravest.’ His voice rang with the truth of it, like a troubadour singing the legends of the old heroes. ‘They sent in their champions to finish the slaughter but the men of Opet cut them down and the others fled. Then they drew up their archers at the mouth of the passage, and fired volleys of arrows into it. Again they went in, but the men of Opet were there waiting for them and again they died in their dozens.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned and came down the passage to stand beside me under the swaying electric bulb, and we were silent for a moment imagining it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My God, Ben. Think of it. What a fight to end with. What glory these men won on that last day.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Even I, a man of peace, was stirred by it. I felt my heartbeat quicken and I turned to him like a child at story-time. ‘What happened then?’ I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They were dying already, weak with a dozen wounds each. There was no strength left in them to continue and they stood shoulder to shoulder, companions in life, and now in death also, leaning wearily on their weapons, but the enemy would not come again. Instead, they built a fire in the mouth of the passage to smoke them out, and when that did not do it, they abandoned the attack and bricked up the entrance turning it into a tomb for the dead and the living alike.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We were all silent then, thinking about Louren’s story. It made sense, it fitted the evidence in all but one respect. I did not want to say it, did not want to spoil such a stirring tale, but Sally had no such compunction.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If that’s true, then what happened to your band of heroes - did they change into moonbeams and flit away?’ Her tone was slightly derisive, but of course she was right. I wished she was not.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren laughed, a little embarrassed chuckle. ‘So <em>you</em> think of something better,’ he challenged her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of the heroes of this ancient drama there was no trace, except that which lay at the foot of the passage below the graven sun image of Baal. It was blanketed by the thick grey dust and it was the final discovery on the archives floor. It was a battle-axe. A weapon of striking beauty and utility. When first I took it up from the paving where it had lain for almost 2,000 years, my hand closed snugly around the haft, the grooves in the handle fitted my fingers as though they had been moulded from them. A broken wrist-strap of leather dangled from the end of the handle.</p>

  <p class="normal">The haft was forty-seven inches long, and fashioned from lengths of rhinoceros horn that had been laminated into a solid rod of steely resilience and strength. The handle was of ivory and the whole had been bound with electrum wire to reinforce its already surpassing strength and to protect the shaft from the cuts of enemy blades. The blade was shaped like a double crescent moon, each side exposing seven and a half inches of razor edge. From its extreme end protruded an unbarbed spike twelve inches long, thus the weapon could be used on the cut as well as the thrust.</p>

  <p class="normal">The head was exquisitely worked and engraved, with the shapes of four vultures with wings spread, one on each side of the double blade. The birds were rendered in such detail that every feather was shown, and beyond the figures a sun rose in a burst of rays like a flower. The engravings were <span lang="en-US">inlaid</span> with electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, and from the silvery sheen of the blades it was clear that they had been tempered. The weapon was caked and dulled with what must have been dried blood, it was obviously the author of those horrible wounds that bloomed upon so many of the corpses scattered along the passage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Holding that beautiful weapon in my hand I was infected by a sudden madness. I was not truly aware of my own intention until the axe was flying in a wide glittering circle around my head. The balance and weight of the great axe was so pure and sweet that no effort was involved as I swung it high, and then into a long overhand killing stroke. The blade whickered eagerly at the kiss of moving air across its bright edge. The flexing of the handle seemed to bring it alive in my hand, alive again after nearly 2,000 long years of sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">From some deep atavistic depths of my soul I felt a cry rising, an exultant yell which seemed the natural accompaniment to the deadly song of the axe. With an effort I checked the flight of the axe and the cry before it reached my lips, and looked around at the faces of the others.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were staring at me as though I had begun raving and frothing at the mouth. Quickly I lowered the axe. I stood there feeling utterly foolish, appalled at my treatment of such a rare treasure. The horn handle could easily have become brittle, and snapped at such harsh usage.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I was just testing it,’ I said lamely. ‘I’m sorry.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">That night we pondered and puzzled the riddle of the archives until well after midnight. We found no answer and afterwards Louren walked with me to my hut.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The Lear is coming to pick me up tomorrow morning, Ben. I’ve been here two weeks already, and I just cannot stay another day. God, when I think of how I’ve neglected my responsibilities since we started on this dig!’</p>

  <p class="normal">We stopped at the door of my hut and Louren lit a cigar.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it about this place that makes us all act so strangely, Ben? Do you feel it also? This strange sense of,’ he hesitated, ‘of destiny.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I nodded, and Louren was encouraged.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That axe. It did something to you, Ben. You weren’t yourself for a few minutes there today ’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am desperate to discover the contents of the scrolls, Ben We must start on that as soon as possible.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is ten years’ work there, Lo. You will have to be patient.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Patience is not one of my virtues, Ben. I was reading of the discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb last night. Lord Carnarvon made the discovery possible, and yet he died before he could look on the sarcophagus of the dead Pharaoh.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t be morbid, Lo.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All right,’ Louren agreed. ‘But don’t waste time, Ben.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You get Hamilton for me,’ I said ‘We can’t do a thing without him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll be in London on Friday,’ Louren told me ‘I’ll see him myself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He is a difficult old codger,’ I warned him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren grinned. ‘Leave him to me. Now, listen to me, Benjamin my boy, if you find anything else here, you let me know immediately, you understand? I want to be here when it happens.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When what happens?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know - something. There is something else here, Ben. I know it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hope you are right, Lo.’ And he clapped my shoulder and walked away into the night towards his own hut.</p>

  <p class="normal">While we worked on in the archives, lifting the human remains and the piles of weapons, a construction crew arrived on the site by Dakota to erect a repository for the scrolls. This was another large prefabricated warehouse, fitted with airtight doors and a powerful air-conditioning unit to maintain the scrolls in an atmosphere of optimum temperature and humidity. A high barbed-wire fence was erected around the building for security reasons, and every precaution for the safety of the scrolls was taken.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the same time the construction crew erected another half-dozen living quarters for the expanded team, and the first inhabitants of these were four high officials of the Botswana Government. It was the Government who had forbidden the removal of the scrolls from the territory and made the erection of the new buildings necessary. The Government deputation stayed for two days, and left satisfied that their interests in the discovery would be adequately protected, but not before I had exacted a solemn promise of secrecy. The announcement of the site would be at my signal only.</p>

  <p class="normal">We began labelling and removing the pottery jars from their shelves, taking the greatest pains to record, both photographically and by written notes, the exact position of each. It seemed likely that they had been stacked in chronological order, and this would assist the work of interpretation.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the Monday I received a crippling blow to my plans in the form of a laconic message from Louren.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hamilton unavailable. Please suggest alternative.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I was disappointed, hurt and angry. Disappointed because Hamilton was the best in the world, and his presence would have immediately given weight and authenticity to my site. I was hurt because Hamilton obviously believed my claims were spurious, my reputation had been damaged by the vicious attacks of my critics and scientific opponents. Hamilton had clearly been influenced by this. He did not want to be party to some mistaken or blatantly fraudulent discovery of mine. Finally, I was angry because Hamilton’s refusal to undertake the work was a direct insult. He had put the mark of the pariah on me and it would discourage others from giving the assistance I desperately needed. I might find myself discredited before I had even started.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He didn’t even give me a chance,’ I protested to Sally. ‘He didn’t even want to listen to me. Christ, I didn’t realize I was such a professional leper. Even talking to me can ruin a reputation!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He’s a skinny, bald-headed old goat!’ Sally agreed. ‘He’s a lecherous old feeler of bottoms, and—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the greatest living authority on ancient writings in the world,’ I told her bitterly. There was no reply to that, and we sat in forlorn silence for a while.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Sally perked up. ‘Let’s go and fetch him!’ she suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He might refuse to see us,’ I gloomed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He won’t refuse to see me,’ Sally assured me, and behind the words was an untold story that set my jealousy coursing corrosively through my veins. Sally had worked for him three years, and I could only console myself that her standards were high enough to exclude Eldridge Hamilton.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Seventy-two hours later I sat in the front lounge of the Bell at Hurley with a pint of good English bitter in front of me, and watched the car park anxiously. It was only a fifteen-minute drive from Oxford and Sally should have been here long ago.</p>

  <p class="normal">I felt tired, irritable and depressed from that soul-destroying overnight flight from Johannesburg to Heathrow. Sally had phoned Hamilton from the airport.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Professor Hamilton, I do hope you don’t mind me phoning you,’ she had cooed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sally Senator, do you remember I worked under you in 1966. That’s right, Sally Green-Eyes.’ And she giggled coyly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I am on my way through England. Just here for a day or two. I felt so lonely and nostalgic - those were wonderful times.’ Her tone had a hundred intimate shades of invitation and promise.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lunch? That’s wonderful, Professor. Why don’t I pick you up. I have a hire car.’ She gave me <em>a</em> triumphant thumbs-up sign.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The Bell at Hurley? Yes, of course, I remember. How could I forget.’ She made a sick face at me. ‘I so look forward to it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The silver Jaguar slid into the car park, and I saw Sally at the wheel. With a scarf in her hair and laughter on her lips, she didn’t look like a girl who had sat fourteen hours in the cramped seat of an intercontinental jet.</p>

  <p class="normal">She slid out of the car, giving me a flash of those wonderful sun-browned thighs, and then she was coming towards me, hanging on the arm of Eldridge Hamilton, and laughing gaily.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hamilton was a tall stoop-shouldered man in his fifties; a baggy Harris tweed suit with leather patches on the elbows hung like a sack on his gaunt frame. His nose was beaky, and his bald pate shone in the pale sunlight as though it had been buffed up with a good wax polish. All in all he was not formidable competition, but his little eyes sparkled behind the heavy horn-rimmed glasses and his lips were slack with desire, exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, as he looked at Sally. I found it a hard price to pay for his services.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally led him to my table, and he was six feet from me before he recognized me. He stopped dead, and I saw him blink once. He knew instantly that he had been taken, and for a moment the whole project hung in the balance. He could so easily have turned on his heel and walked out.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Eldridge!’ I leapt to my feet, crooning seductively. ‘How wonderful to see you.’ And while he still hesitated, I had him by the elbow in a grip like a velvet-lined vice. ‘I’ve ordered you a large Gilbey’s gin and tonic - that’s your poison, isn’t it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was five years since last we had met, and my memory of his personal tastes mollified him slightly. He allowed Sally and I to ease him into a seat and place the gin convenient to his right hand. While Sally and I bombarded him with all our considerable combined charm he maintained a suspicious silence, until the first gin had gone down. I ordered another and he began to thaw, halfway through the third he became skittish and voluble.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did you read Wilfred Snell’s reply to your book <em>Ophir</em> in the <em>Journal</em>?’ he asked. Wilfred Snell was the most vociferous and merciless of all my scientific adversaries, ‘Jolly amusing, what?’ And Eldridge neighed like a randy stallion, and clutched at one of Sally’s beautiful thighs.</p>

  <p class="normal">I am a man of peace, but at that moment I was having difficulty remembering it. My expression must have been a sickly grin, my fingernails were driven like claws into the flesh of my palms as I fought down the temptation to drag Eldridge around the room by his heels.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally wriggled out from his exploring hand, and I suggested in a strangled voice, ‘Let’s go through to lunch, shall we?’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a quick game of musical chairs at the dining-room table, as Eldridge tried to get a seat within clutching distance of Sally and I tried to prevent it.</p>

  <p class="normal">We out-foxed him on a cunning double play, allowing him to settle down triumphantly beaming over the top of his menu at Sally who was backed into a corner beside him, before I cried, ‘Sally, you are in a draught there.’ And smoothly as a pair of ballet dancers we changed seats.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then I could relax and give the pheasant the attention it deserved, although the burgundy that Eldridge suggested was nothing if not gauche.</p>

  <p class="normal">With characteristic tact Eldridge brought up the subject we had all been flirting with.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Met a friend of yours the other day, big flashy chap like a cross between a male model and a professional wrestler. Accent like an Australian with the flu. Had some cock-and-bull story about scrolls you’ve found in a cave outside Cape Town.’ And Eldridge neighed again at a volume that momentarily stopped all other conversation in the room. ‘Damned man had the cheek to offer me money. I know the type, not a bean to bless himself with, and talks like he’s made of the stuff. He had “shyster” written all over him in letters two feet high.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally and I gaped at him, struck dumb by his astute grasp of the facts and his masterly summation of Louren Sturvesant’s character.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sent him packing of course,’ said Eldridge with relish, and stuffed his mouth with breast of pheasant.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You probably did the right thing,’ I murmured. ‘Incidentally the site is in northern Botswana – 1,500 miles from Cape Town.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, yes?’ Eldridge asked, expressing disinterest as politely as one can with a mouthful of pheasant and rotten teeth.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And Louren Sturvesant was on <em>Time</em> Magazine’s list of the thirty richest men in the world,’ murmured Sally. Eldridge stopped chewing with his mouth ajar, and afforded us a fine view of a semi-masticated pheasant breast.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ I affirmed. ‘He is bank-rolling my dig. He has put in 200,000 dollars already, and he has set no limit.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eldridge turned a stricken face towards me. That sort of patron of scientific research was almost as rare as the unicorn, and Eldridge realized suddenly that he had been within range of one and let him escape. All the bumptiousness was gone out of Professor Hamilton.</p>

  <p class="normal">I signalled the waitress to clear my plate, and I swear that I felt true compassion in my heart for Eldridge as I unlocked my briefcase and took from it a cylindrical bundle wrapped in its protective canvas jacket.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have an appointment with Ruben Levy in Tel Aviv tomorrow, Eldridge.’ I opened the canvas wrapping.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have 1,142 of these leather scrolls. So Ruby will be pretty busy for the next few years. Of course, Louren Sturvesant will make a donation of 100,000 dollars to the Tel Aviv University Faculty of Archaeology for their cooperation, and I shouldn’t be surprised if the faculty doesn’t have some of the scrolls given to them as well.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘ Eldridge swallowed his mouthful of pheasant as though it were broken glass. He wiped his fingers and mouth with his napkin, before leaning forward to examine the scroll.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘<em>From out of the southern plains of grass</em>,’ he whispered as he read, and I noticed the difference from Sally’s translation, ‘<em>received 192 large ivory tusks, weighing 221 talents</em>—’ His voice died but his lips moved as he read on. Then he began speaking again, and his voice quavered with excitement.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Punic in the style of the second century BC, do you see the use of ligatures to join the median “m”, still using the hang of the characters from the line, that’s definitely pre-first century EC. Here, Sally, do you see the archaic crossing of the “A”?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have over a thousand of these scrolls, preserved in chronological order - Levy is very excited,’ I interrupted this flow of technicalities with a gentle untruth. Levy didn’t know they existed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Levy,’ Eldridge snorted, and his spectacles flashed with outrage. ‘Levy! Take him outside Hebrew and Egyptian and he’s a babe in the bloody woods!’ He had hold of my wrist now.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben. I insist, I absolutely insist on doing this work!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What about Wilfred Snell’s criticism of my theories? You seemed to find it amusing.’ I had him by the ackers now, and I could afford to be a little cocky. ‘How do you feel about working with somebody whose views are so suspect?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wilfred Snell,’ said Eldridge earnestly, ‘is a monumental jackass. Where did he ever find a thousand Punic scrolls?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Waiter,’ I called, ‘please bring us two large Cordon Argent brandies.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Make that three,’ said Sally.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the brandy diffused a gentle warmth through my body, I listened to Eldridge Hamilton effusing about the scrolls and demanding of Sally information as to exactly where, when and how we had discovered them. I found myself beginning to like the man. It was true that he had teeth like the stumps of a pine forest devastated by fire, but then I am not a perfect physical specimen myself. It was also true that he had a weakness for Gilbey’s gin and pretty girls - but then he differed from me only in his choice of liquor, and who am I to hold that Glen Grant is in any way superior?</p>

  <p class="normal">No, I decided, despite my prejudices, I would be able to work with him, just as long as he kept his bony little claws off Sally.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eldridge followed us out a week after our return to the City of the Moon, and we met him at the airstrip. I was concerned that he might find the transition from a northern winter to our 110°F summer impaired his abilities. I need not have worried. He was one of those Englishmen who, solar topee cocked, go out in the midday sun without raising a sweat. His luggage consisted of a single small valise which contained his personal effects and a dozen large packing-cases filled with chemicals and equipment.</p>

  <p class="normal">I gave him the Grade ‘A’ tour of the site, trying without success to fan his interest in the city and the cavern. Eldridge was a single-minded specialist.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Jolly interesting - now where are the scrolls?’ I think even then he had doubts, but I took him into the archives and he purred like an angular old tomcat as he moved down the burdened stone shelves.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben,’ he said, ‘there’s just one thing still to settle. I write the paper on the actual scrolls, agreed?’ We are a strange breed, we work not for the gold but for the glory. Eldridge was making certain of his share.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Agreed.’ We shook hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well then there is nothing to stop me beginning right away,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ I said, ‘there isn’t, is there.’</p>
