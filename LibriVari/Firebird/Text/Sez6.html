  <p class="normal">‘Ah! Of course. I remember now that your legion’s number was on the honour list.’ The commander chuckled. ‘Of that 20,000 not one returned across the river.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They fought well, though - for pagans,’ Huy conceded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Indeed, Holiness, they are exceptional in that respect also and in the years since then they have become more formidable.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you seen their town?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Holiness, but I have many spies. It is set on the first slopes of the northern escarpment, where the tributary river Kal comes down from the plateau.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is the population?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I believe them to number 50,000.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So large!’ Huy looked up with a mouthful of fish and stared at the commander.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are a numerous tribe - not all of them live in the town. They tend large herds of cattle and are spread over a vast area.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is the town fortified?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is a large and sprawling huddle of huts, Holiness. Some of the huts are ringed with primitive palisades, but these are defence against wild animals only.’</p>

  <p class="normal">A slave refilled Huy’s wine bowl and took away his empty dish. Huy cupped the bowl in his hands and stared moodily into the dark red liquid. His silence discomforted the commander who at last blurted, ‘Is it true that the king will arrive here on the morrow?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes. Lannon Hycanus will march with my legion in the raid.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have never been presented to him,’ the man murmured, and Huy had a penetrating insight into the career of an elderly officer doomed to a minor outpost in the wilderness without patron or prospects.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will commend you to him,’ Huy promised, and saw the pathetic gratitude in the man’s eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">One of the biremes that patrolled the river landed a century of axemen and archers on the far bank in the night, and before dawn they had rigged the lines across the river.</p>

  <p class="normal">The river was 300 paces wide at this point, a dirty green flow of water between steep banks which were thickly wooded and covered with reed and dense vegetation. The rafts were carried down to the river’s edge and attached to the looped lines. The legion boarded in groups of fifty, and the elephants walked away with the line drawing the rafts smoothly across the river.</p>

  <p class="normal">The crossing went with well-drilled precision - it was not the first time a legion had crossed the great river. There were a few minor incidents - two hoplites fell from their rafts and sank swiftly beneath the weight of their armour, one of the rafts capsized a struggling mass of men and equipment into the shallow water beside the bank but all waded to safety, a legionary entangled his arm in one of the lines and had it neatly severed below the elbow - but the crossing was completed before mid-afternoon and Lannon turned to Huy:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bravely done, my Sunbird. Now explain to me your order of march.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy left a cohort to hold the crossing, and to act as a base for his stores, a pile of dried meat and corn in leather bags. His legion would be tired, hungry, and perhaps hard pressed on its return and if all went as was planned, there would also be many thousands of extra mouths to feed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then behind a screen of light infantry and archers he began his march on the barbarian town of Kal. Here the weeks of training and hardening during the march from the Zeng-Hanno showed. For although the ground was broken and heavily forested, the legion moved swiftly in compact columns, covering the ground at a pace that pushed a steady five miles behind them every hour. Ahead of them the scouts insured that no one would carry a warning to the town. The few hundred herders and hunters and root gatherers that were met with by the scouts were dispatched with a silent shower of arrows or a swift clean axe stroke. Their bodies lay where they had fallen beside the track, and the columns trudged on past them with hardly a sidelong glance. Huy saw that they were well-formed men and women, dressed in kilts of animal skins and with tribal scars on their cheeks and breasts. Like most of the tribes from the north their skins were a very dark blueish black. Some of them had mutilated their teeth by filing them to a sharp point like those of a shark, and the men were armed with throwing spears and light axes with half-moon-shaped blades.</p>

  <p class="normal">The legion halted after dark, and ate cold cooked meat and corn cakes from their pouches while the wine-carriers moved amongst them filling the bowls.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look.’ Huy touched Lannon’s shoulder and pointed towards the northern hills. The sky glowed, as though the moon was rising from the wrong direction. It was the reflected light from thousands of cooking fires.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A rich harvest,’ Lannon nodded. ‘Just as the witch prophesied.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy stirred uncomfortably at the mention of Tanith, but remained silent.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Her words have troubled me - I’ve spent many nights pondering them.’ Lannon wiped his greasy fingers and lips, before he reached for the wine bowl. ‘She preaches death and darkness and betrayal by a friend.’ He rinsed his mouth with wine and spat it on the ground before drinking.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy murmured, ‘She did not preach, Majesty - she replied to a question.’</p>

  <p class="normal">But <span lang="en-US">Lannon</span> said, ‘I believe she is evil.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sire!’ protested Huy quickly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do not be misled by a pretty face, Huy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She is young, innocent,’ he began but saw Lannon leaning towards him and peering into his face, and he stopped.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is this witch to you, my Sunbird?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As a maid, she means nothing. How could she, she belongs to the goddess,’ Huy denied his love, and Lannon leaned back and grunted sceptically.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is as well - you are wise in all things but women, my friend. You must let me guide you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are always kind,’ Huy muttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Keep away from that one, Huy. Be warned by one who loves you, she will bring you nothing but sorrow.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have rested long enough.’ Huy stood up and settled the strap of his axe about his wrist. ‘It is time to march.’</p>

  <p class="normal">After midnight they crested the low line of hills that formed the first slope of the escarpment, and before them spread a wide-open basin of land through which the dark river Kal meandered. The basin was moon-washed silver and blue, and the smoke from 10,000 cooking fires spread like a pale sea mist across the river, lying in layers in the still night air.</p>

  <p class="normal">The fires had died to pin-points of dull red that speckled the town, and the huts were dark and shapeless, scattered thickly without plan or pattern, a vast agglomeration of primitive dwellings.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He estimated 50,000 - and he’s not far wrong.’ Huy looked out across the basin, and beside him Lannon asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How will you proceed?’ And Huy smiled in the moonlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You taught me how to hunt game, my king.’</p>

  <p class="normal">His cohort commanders came for their orders, cloaked and helmeted and grim. Huy ordered out a thin screen of light infantry and covering bowmen to the east. During the day the scouts had captured 4,000 of the rangy little scrub cattle belonging to the Vendi.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Take the cattle with you. You remember Hannibal’s ruse in Italia, it will serve us as well upon the great river.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon laughed delightedly and clapped Huy’s shoulder when he had explained it. ‘Fly for me, Sunbird.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Roar for me, Gry-Lion,’ Huy grinned back at him as he settled and buckled his helmet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Silently Huy led 4,500 of his heavy infantry and axemen around to the west and lay them in a crescent shape at the edge of the forest beyond the town. Huy slept for an hour and when one of his centurions shook him awake he was stiff and cold with the night dew.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Stand to!’ he ordered quietly, and the word was passed from mouth to mouth. There was a stirring and a dark movement along the edge of the forest as the legionaries slung their axes and swords and bows, and took up instead the slavers’ wooden clubs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy and Lannon hurried to the command position at the centre of the line, shrugging off their cloaks and flexing cold muscles.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy looked out across the sleeping town and the smell of it was wood smoke and cooking food and human excrement, a great sour smell of humanity that wrinkled his nostrils. The town was silent except for the lonely barking of a cur, and the petulant wail of a sleepless baby.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy said softly, ‘The time is now.’ And Lannon nodded. Huy turned and gave the order to one of his centurions and the man stooped over a clay fire pot and blew flame to life on the bunch of pitch-dipped rags that tipped the signal arrow. When the flame had caught and blossomed he notched the arrow and loosed it in a high arching parabola against the dark sky. From along the line the signal was repeated, orange flame soaring briefly in the darkness, but the silence was unbroken and the town slept on.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They have set no guards, no picket, nothing,’ Lannon remarked scornfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are barbarians,’ Huy pointed out mildly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They deserve slavery,’ Lannon said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They will fare better as slaves than free men,’ Huy agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will dress them and feed them and show them the true gods.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon nodded. ‘We have come to lead them out of the darkness and into the sun.’ And he shifted the heavy slaving club into his right hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the east, appearing suddenly out of the edge of the forest, stampeded a mass of bellowing, maddened cattle. On their horns burned torches of pitch and grass, behind them they dragged flaming dry branches and they were driven by their own terror and by a line of yelling whooping warriors. The whole scene was hellish with dust and smoke and flame. The line of cattle crashed into the town, knocking down the flimsy grass huts, leaving fire to bloom and spread in their wake, trampling the sleep-drugged naked Vendi that stumbled into their path. Behind them ran the warriors, clubbing down the survivors and leaving them lying in the hoof-churned dust.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy heard a steady climbing wail from the town, the sound of thousands of terrified voices. He heard the drumming of running hooves and saw the explosions of yellow flame and sparks mount into the night sky as the tinder-dry huts burned.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hold your line,’ he called to the men in the darkness around him. ‘Leave no gaps in the net for the fish to slip through.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The night was filled with movement and sound and flame. The flames spread quickly lighting the scene with a great flickering orange light, and the Vendi darted and milled and screamed as the grim line of marauders moved down upon them. The clubs rose and fell and the sound of the blows against bone was that of woodsmen working in a forest. They fell black and naked, and lay in the glaring firelight, or crawled and wriggled and wailed.</p>

  <p class="normal">One woman with her infant clutched to her breast saw the relentless line bearing down on her, and she whirled like a doe startled from covert and ran into the tall bellowing flames of burning thatch. She burned like a torch, her hair exploding, and she screamed once and then fell scorched and unrecognizable into the flames. Huy saw it, and his blood madness cooled, congealing into revulsion and disgust.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hold!’ he shouted. ‘Lighten your blows!’ And slowly out of this terrible confusion order emerged. The slave-masters were there ordering the captives into squatting lines, the infantry swept the town clear, and the flames burned themselves out, leaving only black mounds of smoking ash.</p>

  <p class="normal">The dawn came up, a red and angry dawn - across which drifted banks of dark smoke. When Huy led the praise chant to Baal, the cries and wailing of the captives rose with the voice of the legion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy hurried through the devastation ordering and organizing the retreat. Already two cohorts under the young Bakmor had started back towards the great river driving an uncounted herd of captured cattle before them. Huy guessed there might be as many as 20,000 head of the scrubby little beasts. Bakmor had Huy’s orders to swim the cattle across the river and return immediately to cover the retreat.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now his concern was to get the slow unwieldy columns of slaves moving. The approach march that his legion had made in half a day and night would surely take two or three days on the return. The newly captured slaves must be chained, and unaccustomed to their bonds they would move but slowly, retarding the march. Every hour’s delay was dangerous, and would make the heavily encumbered legion more vulnerable to attack or reprisal.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of his centurions accosted him, his tunic blackened with smoke and his beard singed. ‘My lord!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The slaves. There are few young men amongst them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy turned to examine one of the masses of squatting black humanity. They were festooned with the light marching chains, shackled at the neck like hunting dogs in leash.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes.’ He saw it now, they were mostly women and immature youths. The slave-masters had weeded out the old and infirm, but there were very few men of warrior age and status. Huy picked a bright-looking youngster from the squatting ranks and spoke to him in the vernacular.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where are the warriors?’ The youth looked startled at being addressed in his own language, but he dropped his eyes sullenly and would not answer. The centurion half drew his sword, and at the scrape of steel in the scabbard the boy glanced up fearfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A drop more blood will mean nothing,’ Huy warned him, and the boy hesitated before replying.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They have gone to the north to hunt the buffalo.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When will they return?’ Huy demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not know,’ the slave shrugged expressively, and Huy now had a more telling reason for haste. The fighting regiments of the Vendi were intact, and this towering beacon of smoke would draw them as meat draws the vultures.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get them up, and moving,’ he ordered the centurion and hurried away. Lannon came out of the smoke followed by his armour-bearers and men-at-arms. One glance at his face was enough to warn Huy, for it was flushed and scowling.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did you order the slave-master to spare those they reject?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, sire.’ Suddenly Huy was impatient with the king’s rages and tantrums, there were more important matters to occupy him now.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘By what authority?’ Lannon demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘By the authority of a commander of a Royal Legion in the field,’ Huy answered him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I commanded a burning.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But not a massacre of the aged and infirm.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I want the tribes to know that Lannon Hycanus passed this way.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I leave witnesses to it,’ Huy told him shortly. ‘If these old ones would burden us, will they not also be a burden upon their tribe?’ Lannon drew himself up. Huy saw his rage boil over - and he took Lannon’s arm in unexpectedly conspiratorial grip.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Majesty, there is something of importance I must tell you.’ And before Lannon could give vent to his rage Huy had led him aside. ‘The regiments of Vendi have escaped us, they are in the field and out in battle array.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon’s rage was forgotten. ‘How close are they?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not know - except that the longer we talk the closer they come.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">It was past noon before the long files of shuffling slaves were all tallied and moving. The slave-masters reported in to Huy’s command post, and the final count was almost 22,000 human beings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Despite Huy’s orders to keep the column bunched and under control, the files of chained Vendi stretched over four miles and their pace was that of the slowest. At a laboured crawl like a crippled centipede, they wound through the hills and down into the bad broken ground of the valley bottom.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first attack hit them a little after midnight on the first night. It came as a shock to Huy, for although he had taken every precaution for a night camp in enemy territory, he had not expected anything like this from the tribes. A few sentries with slit throats, a flight of arrows from ambush, even a swift rush and withdrawal at some weak spot along the line, but not a full-scale night attack which showed every evidence of planning and control, and which was pressed home with murderous intent.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only training and discipline held his legion together before that howling torrent that hurled itself upon them from the darkness. For two hours they closed up and fought, with the trumpets blowing the standfast and the rallying cries of the centurions ringing out in the darkness.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘On me, the Sixth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Steady, the Sixth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hold hard, the Sixth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">When the moon came out and lit the field, the attackers melted away into the forests and Huy could stride among his cohorts and assess his position.</p>

  <p class="normal">The dead tribesmen were piled chest deep about the square where the cohorts had stood. In the torch light the skirmishers were finishing the enemy wounded with quick sword thrusts, while others were tending their own wounded and laying out their dead for cremation. Huy was relieved to see how small a toll the enemy had exacted from the defence, and how grievous a price they had paid themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the confusion of the battle many of the files of slaves had responded to the calls of the attackers and, with a concerted rush, had broken out of the square and escaped into the night still linked together. But there were still more than 16,000 of them howling with terror and hunger and thirst.</p>

  <p class="normal">The legion lit its cremation fires in the dark and sang the praise chant to Baal on the march. Before the sun had been up an hour, it was clear what tactics the Vendi had decided upon for that day. Each feature along the route was contested by groups of archers and spearmen. They had to be laboriously dislodged, always falling back before the charges of Huy’s axemen, but at the same time the flanks of the column and the rear were harried and tested by repeated attacks in considerable strength.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have never heard of this happening before,’ protested Lannon during a lull while he unbuckled his helmet to air his sweat-sodden curls, and wash his mouth out with wine. ‘They behave like drilled and trained troops.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is something new,’ Huy agreed as he accepted a cloth one of his armour-bearers had wetted for him. Huy’s arms and face were speckled with droplets of thrown blood, and blood had dried black and crusty on the blade and shaft of the vulture axe.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They have direction and purpose - I have never known tribesmen regroup after a charge has broken them. I have never known them come back after a mauling.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon spat red wine upon the ground. ‘We may have better sport than we had bargained for before the day is out,’ he laughed with anticipation and passed the wine bowl to Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a place where the track crossed a narrow stream and then passed between two symmetrical rounded maiden’s breast hills. There was a ford at the stream and on the approaches to it sixteen spears had been set in the earth and spiked upon them were the severed heads of legionaries who had been with Bakmor’s cohorts that had gone ahead with the cattle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bakmor has not got through unscathed either,’ Huy remarked, as he watched the heads taken down and hurriedly wrapped in leather cloaks.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sixteen from twelve hundred is hardly a disaster to rank with Lake Trasimene,’ Lannon remarked easily. ‘And with their grisly display they have warned us of their intention to hold the ford - weak tactics, Sunbird.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Perhaps, my lord,’ Huy conceded, but he had noticed the faces of his men who had seen the ragged red throats and the dull staring eyes of the trophy heads. Their stomachs had cooled a little.</p>

  <p class="normal">The ford was held as Lannon had predicted. It was held by a force that Huy guessed was not less than twice his own, and while they attempted to hack their way through the attacks upon the flanks and rear never let up. Twice Huy pulled his axemen and infantry out of the reddened mud of the ford to rest and reform. By now the day was baking hot and the legionaries were tiring.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon had received a spear-thrust in the face which had opened his cheek to the bone, a wound that looked uglier than it really was and his beard was thick with blood and dust. A physician was stitching the wet lips of the wound closed when Huy joined the group around the king, and Lannon dismissed his anxious inquiry with a chuckle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It will leave an interesting scar.’ Then without moving his head he told Huy, ‘I have discovered the solution to the mystery, Huy, and there it is!’ He pointed across the stream to the closest of the two hills. The crest was just out of random arrow range, perhaps 500 paces away. Although the slopes of the hill were forested the crest was a dome of rounded bare granite, and upon the dome stood a small group of men. They were gathered about a central figure.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy would always remember him as he was that fateful noon on the hilltop beside the ford. The distance did not dwarf him as it did the men about him. In some strange fashion it made his physical presence more imposing. He was a huge man, fully a head and shoulder taller than his com-panions. The sun shone on the oiled black muscles of his chest and arms, and a tall head-dress of blue heron feathers stood wind-tossed and proud upon his head. He wore a short kilt of leopard tails around his waist, but Huy did not need that to know he was a king.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ah!’ he said softly, and he felt something stir in him, a cold sliding thing like an uncoiling snake. On the hilltop the Vendi king made a sweeping gesture, and then stabbed towards the ford with his heavy war spear. It was clearly the delivery of a command, and from the group around him a messenger broke away and raced down the slope of the hill carrying the order.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘At last the tribes have found a leader,’ said Huy. ‘I should have guessed it earlier.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Take him for me,’ Lannon commanded. ‘I want him. Nothing else is important. Take that man for me.’ And Huy heard a new tone in Lannon’s voice. It puzzled him and he glanced at his king. He saw it then. It was not the pain of his crudely stitched cheek that made dark shadows play in the pale blue eyes. For the first time in all the years Huy knew that Lannon was afraid.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Huy timed it carefully for the last hour before dark, for the last of the day when the shadows were long and the light uncertain. During the afternoon he skirmished at the ford in half-cohort strength, but in the thick forest on the banks of the stream he held his main strength in reserve. He let them rest during the heat of the afternoon, let them eat and drink and sharpen their blades while he made his preparations. He chose fifty of his finest, selecting them by name from the ranks and he took them well back where they would be screened from prying eyes on the heights beyond the stream.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the bottoms of the cooking-pots they scraped the thick black soot and mixed it into a thick paste with cooking oil. There was not enough to darken the skins of fifty men so for their arms and legs they used the black mud from the river. They were all of them stripped stark naked when the slave chains were shackled about their throats, but instead of the iron pins a thin dry twig was used to close the links on every collar. They could not take shields with them, and they smeared their weapons with a thick coating of black mud to hide the twinkle and flash of naked metal, then they strapped them to their backs so they could run empty-handed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are slaves, not legionaries,’ Huy told them. ‘Run like a slave, scamper like a beaten dog.’</p>

  <p class="normal">When they broke from the trees and ran for the river with half a century of legionaries in pursuit, they howled with terror and the carefully aimed arrows pattered around them. They reached the bank 500 paces upstream from the ford. As they blundered across, still linked together by the slave chain, the Vendi king from his vantage point saw their escape and sent two large parties of archers and spearmen to screen their crossing.</p>

  <p class="normal">A fierce bloody little battle flared up on the river bank, and under cover of the tumult Huy got his group over the river and into the shelter of the forest on the far bank. There was a thin detachment of tribesmen in set positions amongst the trees, but by the time they realized the deception Huy’s band had dropped their chains and cut into them in a silent murderous rush.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then they were through with nothing opposing them to the foot of the command hill. Bunched up, and hidden by the forest, Huy led them at a run around the back of the hill. They had moved fast, and he rested them here for a few minutes. The mud had washed from legs and arms during the crossing of the river and the soot and oil was streaky with sweat giving them a wild and desperate appearance.</p>

  <p class="normal">The clamour of the fighting at the river had died away and the forest was silent and still as Huy led his band up the back slope of the hill. There were sentries posted here, but they were inattentive and did not see the weird blackened figures amongst the forest shades until it was too late.</p>

  <p class="normal">Below the bare dome of granite Huy waited again, listening for the diversion which Lannon had promised. The distant yells and tiny scraping sound of metal from the ford were almost blanketed by the distance and the intervening bulk of the hill.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy said <span lang="en-US">softly</span>, ‘Now, All together.’ And they burst from the forest edge and went racing away up the granite dome. Huy led them easily, bounding ahead with the loping long-armed gait of an old bull baboon.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was twenty paces from the crest, the Vendi king sensed his presence and turned to face Huy. He shouted a warning to his staff, and Huy went at him like a terrier at the throat of a lion. Two of the king’s bodyguard leapt to intervene, but Huy flicked a casual axe stroke at them, rolling his wrist slightly in mid-stroke so the blade whimpered as it changed direction, killing the one guard cleanly and taking the spear arm of the other away above the elbow with a single cut. They fell aside and Huy went on to take the king.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was a big man, perhaps the biggest Huy had ever met, and his skin was a shiny purplish black. The muscles of shoulder and arms were bunched and knotted. The sinews of his neck stood out starkly, corded into the heavy bone of his jaw. His head was round as a river-washed boulder, and without head-dress the scalp was bald and polished black.</p>

  <p class="normal">He moved to meet Huy, sliding in on thick black legs with his leopard-skin kilts swirling, crouching slightly with the stabbing spear held underhand, the blade glistening hungrily for the softness of Huy’s belly. He moved with leopard speed, reacting instantly to Huy’s attack, and there was a sense of savage power and energy about him that checked Huy’s charge and made him whirl instinctively to the side, just as the blade of the stabbing spear slashed upwards through nothingness where Huy’s belly should have been.</p>

  <p class="normal">The huge black man grunted as his stroke died in air, and his tawny yellow eyes fastened on Huy. He struck again and Huy hopped aside as the point hissed past him, and Huy reached out as he sprang and ran the stabbing point of the axe across the giant’s exposed ribs. The purple black skin opened and for an instant white bone showed in the depths of the wound before the rush of dark blood obscured it. The king bellowed at the sting of it, and he struck and slashed and cut at the dancing gadfly before him. Each stroke wilder, each charge more reckless as Huy goaded him, watching for his moment. It came and suddenly Huy was through the circle of the spear.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the point of the axe he probed for the <span lang="en-US">femoral</span> artery in the giant’s groin, running the engraved steel into the tight flesh half an inch too far to the right, missing the artery but dropping the king to one knee. Huy twisted out of close contact. The axe flew high and Huy went into the kill stroke aiming at the round black skull of the kneeling king, a stroke which would split him to the chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For Baal!’ he shouted, sending the axe down from on high. Then in full stroke he changed. He never knew what impulse it was that made him check, made him twist the weapon, presenting the flat of the blade and not the edge, holding the stroke half back so that the side of the axe cracked against the king’s skull with enough force to topple him forward senseless onto his face but not enough to stove in the bone of the great round head.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy jumped back and with one quick glance made certain that the Vendi king’s train were all lying lifeless on the dome of granite, and his legionaries were grouped around him resting on their bloody swords. The surprise had been complete and overwhelming.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy turned and ran to the highest point of the hill. Naked and filthy with soot and mud he brandished his axe above his head, and his band cheered and waved their weapons also. From the ford a trumpet began to blare the advance, and immediately the call was taken up and shrilled from cohort to cohort.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy watched Lannon lead the first wave across the ford. The legion crashed into the leaderless tribesmen who opposed them, and drove through them with scarcely a check, splitting them and driving them back against the hills in a disorganized rabble. They had seen their king cut down and there was no spirit left in any of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the hilltop Huy watched Lannon commit his last two reserve cohorts at exactly the right moment. The tribesmen broke and made a rout of it. Throwing aside their weapons they streamed back in a wailing panic-stricken mob into the bottleneck between the hills.</p>

  <p class="normal">At that moment the handsome young Bakmor, with the two cohorts which had driven the captured cattle to the great river, marched out of the forest. He deployed the cohorts neatly across the only line of retreat open to the tribes. His return was timely indeed, and Huy watched him with grudging professional approval as he made his dispositions. As the sun touched the horizon in a splendour of red and purple the trumpets sounded the advance once again, and the slaughter and the slave-taking lasted until after midnight.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Huy crossed his legion and the host of wild slaves, using the elephant-drawn rafts at Sett. After the battle at the ford the return march had been unopposed. The regiments of the Vendi had been shattered, all their war chiefs killed or captured and Lannon was jubilant.</p>

  <p class="normal">He told Huy, ‘My Sunbird! It was more than I asked of you. Even I did not guess that such a dangerous enemy had grown up upon my borders. It we had left him another year, only the gods know how deadly he might have become.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Baal smiled upon me,’ Huy <span lang="en-US">disclaimed</span> modestly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And so does Lannon Hycanus,’ Lannon assured him. ‘What was the harvest, Sunbird? Has old Rib-Addi made the accounting yet?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hope so, my lord.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Send for him,’ Lannon commanded, and Rib-Addi came with his scrolls and his ink-stained fingers and his untrusting little book-keeper’s eyes. He read out the lists of cattle and slaves of each grade, every one of them carefully categorized by the slave-masters.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The prices will be much depressed, sire,’ Rib-Addi pointed out pessimistically. ‘For the other legions have taken a great tribute from all the tribes across the river. It will be two or three years before the markets of Opet have absorbed this mass of wealth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nevertheless, the prize money taken by the Sixth Ben-Amon must be considerable, Rib-Addi.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As my lord says.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How much?’ Lannon demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rib-Addi looked alarmed, ‘I could only hazard a guess, Majesty.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Guess, then,’ Lannon invited him,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It could be as much as 25,000 fingers - and as low as—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You would smell dung in an alabaster jar of perfume,’ Lannon chided the old man. ‘Do not give me your low figure.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As my lord pleases.’ Rib-Addi bowed, and Lannon turned to Huy and clasped his shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Your share is one part in a hundred, Sunbird. Two hundred and fifty fingers - you are a rich man at last! How does it feel?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It does not sicken me,’ Huy grinned at him, and Lannon laughed delightedly as he turned back to Rib-Addi.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Write in your book, old man. Write that Lannon Hycanus sets aside half of his share of the prize. He makes it over as an award to the legion commander, Huy Ben-Amon, for his conduct of the campaign.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, that is one part in twenty,’ Rib-Addi protested vehemently. ‘It is an award of over 1,000 fingers!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have learned my figures also,’ Lannon assured him, and the book-keeper might have protested further, but he saw Lannon’s expression.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It shall be written,’ he mumbled, and Huy came to kneel before his king in gratitude.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Up!’ Lannon ordered him, smiling. ‘Do not grovel for me, old friend.’ And Huy went to stand beside Lannon’s stool, as the king called each of the officers who had acted with distinction and made the awards.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy was lost in a trance of avarice, hardly able to credit his fortune. He was rich - rich! He must sacrifice to the gods this very day. A white bull, at the least. As Rib-Addi had pointed out, the market was flooded and Huy would be able to get one cheaply. Then he remembered that he no longer had to stint.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could afford any luxury he had ever coveted, and still have enough over for an estate on the terraces of Zeng, a share in one of Habbakuk-Lal’s trading galleys. A seat on one of the gold-mining syndicates, a secure income for life. No more patches in his tunics, no more bullying his household to cut down on the consumption of meat, no more of the cheap sour wines from the harbour taverns. And then his mind jumped, no more reliance on Lannon’s hospitality and on the goodwill of his young slave girls. He would have one of his own - no, damn it, two - three! Young and pretty and pliant. He felt his body stir. He could afford a wife now, even the daughters of the noble houses might turn a blind eye to his back when dazzled by such a pile of the golden metal.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then suddenly he remembered Tanith, and the phantom slave girls and wives faded back into the mists of his imagining. His spirits plunged sickeningly. The priestesses of Astarte were dedicated to the goddess, they could never marry. Suddenly Huy did not feel as rich as he had a moment before.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you not hear your king when he speaks?’ Lannon demanded, and Huy started guiltily.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, I was dreaming. Forgive me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is no longer necessary to dream,’ Lannon told him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What was it the Gry-Lion asked?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I said we should send for the barbarian - we can deal with him before the legion assembles.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy looked around at his cohorts drawn up in an open square before the leather awning under which Lannon sat. The legions’ standards glittered in the sunlight, and the officers stood at ease before their men. They waited expectantly, and Huy sighed quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As the Gry-Lion wishes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Order it so,’ Lannon commanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had chained him at wrists and ankles, as well as at the throat. The slave-masters could pick a dangerous one at a glance, and two of them held him in leash by the chains from his throat collar.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was as big as Huy remembered, and his skin even darker, but he was a young man. This came as a shock to Huy, he had thought of him as being in his prime years but this was an illusion. The man’s physical bulk and his commanding presence made him older than his years.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy saw how he had fought against his bonds, tearing his own flesh, smearing the skin on the unyielding iron shackles, and the wound in his groin had been crudely dressed with leaves and bark. There were the first watery yellow discharges of putrefication soiling the dressing, and the flesh around it looked hard and swollen. Although he limped, although the chains jangled mockingly at every pace, and although the slave-masters braced against him as though he were a captured animal, there was no mistaking that he was a king. He stood before Lannon and lowered his head slightly on the thick sinewed neck. His eyes were ferocious, even the whites were smoking yellow and covered with a fine lacework of blood vessels, and he stared at his captors with a hatred that was a palpable thing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You captured this - this great black beast, Huy?’ Lannon returned the giant’s stare. ‘Without help, you took him?’ Lannon shook his head with wonder and turned to Huy, but Huy was watching the Vendi king.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is your name?’ Huy asked softly, and the big round head swivelled towards him, the fierce eyes held his</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How do you have the tongue of Vendi?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have many tongues,’ Huy assured him. ‘Who are you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Manatassi, King of the Vendi,’ And Huy translated for Lannon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell him he is king no longer,’ Lannon snapped, and Manatassi shrugged and smiled. His smile was a frightening thing for although the thick purple lips drew back to expose strong white teeth, yet his eyes still smoked with hatred.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fifty thousand warriors of Vendi call me king still,’ he answered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A slave king of a slave people,’ Lannon laughed, and then to Huy. ‘What of him, Huy? Is he not a dangerous enemy? Can we afford to let him live?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy tore his gaze from the slave king and considered the question, trying to think logically but finding it difficult, Huy had conceived a sudden but powerful proprietary interest in Manatassi. He was impressed with the man’s power and presence, with the military skills he had displayed, with the cunning and cleverness and the strange smouldering depths of him. Huy had taken him, he could claim him, even from Lannon, and he was strongly tempted to do so now, for he sensed that here was some extraordinary opportunity. To take this man and educate him, civilize him - what might be made of him! He felt an excitement as a new idea tried to struggle to the surface of his mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think not,’ Lannon answered himself. ‘From the first moment I saw him, on the hill above the ford, I knew he was dangerous. Deadly dangerous. I do not think we can let him live, Huy. He would make a fine messenger to the gods. We will dedicate him to Baal and send him as a messenger to express our gratitude for the outcome of the campaign.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord,’ Huy dropped his voice for Lannon alone, ‘I have a feeling about this man. I feel I could enlighten him, teach him the true gods. He is young, my lord, I could work upon him, and when we are ready we could return him to his people.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have the birds picked out your brain?’ Lannon looked at Huy in astonishment. ‘Why should we return him to his people, when we have spent so much effort on capturing him?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We could use him as an ally then.’ Huy was trying desperately to get his idea over. ‘Through him we could make <em>a</em> treaty with the tribes. We could win him over and use him to secure our northern borders.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Treaties with barbarians!’ Lannon was angry now. ‘What nonsense is this? Secure our northern borders, you say? One thing, and one thing only will secure our northern borders, and that is a sharp sword in a strong hand.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, please hear me out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Huy. I will have no more of it. He must die - and quickly.’ Lannon stood up. ‘Tonight at sunset. Prepare to send him.’ And Lannon strode away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dismiss the legion,’ Huy ordered his commanders, and nodded to the slave-masters to lead the captive away. But Manatassi stepped forward dragging the slave-masters with him on his chains.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘High born!’ Manatassi called Huy, who turned back to him with surprise. He had not expected a title of respect.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’ Huy looked at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is it death?’ Manatassi asked, and Huy nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is death,’ he admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But you argued for me?’ Manatassi insisted, and again Huy nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why?’ demanded the slave king, and Huy could not answer. He spread his hands, a gesture of weariness and incomprehension.</p>

  <p class="normal">Twice already,‘ the slave king said. ’First you turned the blade which should have killed, and now you speak for me. Why?‘</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not know. I cannot explain.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You feel the bond - the bond between us,’ Manatassi declared, and his voice sank low, rumbling and soft. ‘The bond of the spirits. You felt it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’ Huy shook his head, and hurried away to his tent. He worked on his scrolls for most of the afternoon, recording the campaign, describing the burning and the battle at the ford, listing the battle honours and the slaves taken, the booty and the glory - but he could not bring himself to describe Manatassi. The man would soon be dead, let his memory die with him, let it not linger on to haunt the living. A phrase that Lannon had used stuck in his mind, ‘the black beast’, and he used it as the only reference to the doomed slave king.</p>

  <p class="normal">He ate the noon meal with Bakmor and a few others of his young officers, but his mood infected them all and the meal was awkward, the conversation trivial and stilted. Afterwards Huy spent an hour with his adjutant and quartermaster ordering the legion’s affairs, then he worked with the axe until his sweat ran down his body in streams. He scraped and oiled and changed into fresh robes for the sacrifice, and went to Lannon’s tent. Lannon was in conference, a group of his advisers and officials sitting in a half-circle around him on the skins and cushions. Lannon looked up and smiled and called Huy to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sit by me, my Sunbird. There is something here on which I would value your thoughts.’ And Huy sat and listened to Lannon directing the affairs of the four kingdoms with a quick and confident logic. He made decisions which would have tormented Huy for days, and he made them easily, without doubts or hesitations. Then he dismissed his court, and turned to Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A bowl of wine with me, Huy. It will be many days before we have the chance again, for in the morning I leave you,’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Whither, my lord?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I return to Opet, but at speed. I will leave you and your slaves and herds to make the best of it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They drank together, exchanging the seemingly easy desultory talk of old friends, but Huy was manoeuvring for an opening to speak of Manatassi, and Lannon was deftly denying it to him. At last Huy in desperation approached the subject directly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The Vendi king, my lord.’ And he got no further, for Lannon slammed the wine bowl down so that it cracked and a ruby gush of the lees spurted onto the furs on which they sat.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You presume on friendship. I have ordered his death. Except for the axe stroke the matter is settled.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I believe it is a mistake.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘To let him live will be a greater mistake.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Enough, Huy! Enough, I say! Go out now and send him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">In the sunset they brought the Vendi king to a clear place on the river bank below the garrison walls of Sett. He was dressed in a cloak of leather, worked with the symbols of Baal, and he wore the symbolical chains of the sacrifice. Huy stood with the priests and nobles, and when they led the doomed king forward his eyes fastened on Huy’s. Those terrible yellow eyes seemed almost to hook into his flesh, seemed to draw Huy’s soul out through his eye sockets.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy began the ritual, chanting the offertory, making the obeisance to the flaming god image in the western sky and all the while he could feel those eyes eating into the core of his existence.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy’s assistant offered him the vulture axe, polished and glinting red and gold in the last rays of the sunset. Huy went to where Manatassi stood, and looked up at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The slave-masters stepped forward and lifted the cloak from the shoulders of the sacrifice. Except for the golden chains he was naked and magnificent. They had removed the raw-hide sandals from his feet. The slave-masters waited with the chains in their hands, at Huy’s signal they would jerk the sacrifice off his feet and stretch him out upon the ground. His neck drawn out for the axe blade.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy hesitated, unable to force himself to give the order, held fascinated by those fierce yellow eyes. With an effort he tore his gaze free and looked downwards. He had started to give the signal, but his hand froze. He was staring at Mana-tassi’s bare feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Around him the watchers stirred restlessly, glancing towards the horizon where the sun was rapidly sliding below the trees. Soon it would be too late.</p>

  <p class="normal">Still Huy stared at Manatassi’s feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The sun goes, Priest. Strike!’ Lannon called abruptly, angrily in the silence and the sound of his voice seemed to arouse Huy. He turned to Lannon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, there is something you must see.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The sun is going,’ Lannon called impatiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You must see it,’ Huy insisted, and Lannon strode forward to stand beside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look!’ Huy pointed at the Vendi king’s feet, and Lannon frowned on a quick intake of breath.</p>

  <p class="normal">Manatassi’s feet were monstrously deformed, deeply divided between the toes so that they resembled the claws of some preternatural bird. Involuntarily Lannon stepped backwards, making the full-handed sun sign to avert evil.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He is bird-footed,’ Huy said, ‘he has the feet of the sacred Sunbird of Baal.’ And there was a rustle and murmur from the watchers. They craned forward with a ghoulish, superstitious curiosity.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy raised his voice. ‘I declare this man god-marked. He is favoured by the gods - and cannot be sent as a messenger.’</p>

  <p class="normal">As he spoke the sun dropped below the rim of the world and there was a chill and a dankness in the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon was in a towering, shaking rage that paled his lips and face so that the black clotted scab of his wound stood out clearly on his cheek.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You defied me!’ he said it softly, but in a voice that trembled with his rage.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He is god-marked!’ Huy protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do not try to hide behind your gods, Priest. You and I both know that many <span lang="en-US">of</span> Baal’s decisions are made by Huy Ben-Amon, for Huy Ben-Amon.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Majesty,’ Huy gasped at the accusation, at the dreadful blasphemy of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You defied me,’ Lannon repeated. ‘You think to place this barbarian beyond my reach, you aspire to play the game of power and politics with me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is not true, my lord. I would not dare.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You <em>would</em> dare, Priest. You would dare to steal the teeth from the mouth of the living Gry-Lion, it the fancy came upon you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, I am your true, your most loyal—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tread lightly, Priest. I warn you. You fly high in the tour kingdoms, but remember always that you do so by my favour alone.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know this well.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I who exalted you, have it in my power to throw you down as readily.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know this also, my lord,’ said Huy humbly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then give <span lang="en-US">me</span> this barbarian,’ Lannon demanded, and Huy looked up at him with an expression of deep regret.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He is not mine to give, my lord. He belongs to the gods.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon let out a bellow of frustrated rage, and snatched up a heavy amphora of wine. He hurled it at Huy’s head, and Huy ducked nimbly. The amphora slapped into the leather side of the tent, cushioning the impact and it dropped to the ground without breaking, wine gurgled from the mouth and soaked into the dry earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon was on his feet now, towering over Huy, holding out towards him fists bunched into bony clubs, the muscles in his forearms knotted and ridged with exasperation. He held those fists under Huy’s nose, and his eyes were pale glittering blue and deadly, the thick red-golden ringlets danced on his shoulders as he shook with the tempests of his rage.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Go!’ he said in a strangled voice. ‘Go quickly - before -before I—’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy did not wait to hear the rest of it.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon Hycanus marched <span lang="en-US">from</span> Sett with a bodyguard of 200 men, and Huy watched him go from the walls of the garrison. He felt a chill of apprehension, vulnerable now and lonely without the king’s favour.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy watched the small travelling party march out between the ranks of the legion, and saw that Lannon wore only a light tunic and that he was bareheaded in the early morning sunlight, his hair shining like a beacon fire. His armour-bearers followed him with helmet and breastplate, bow and sword and javelins. At Lannon’s heels followed the little pygmy hunt-master, Xhai the bushman; he was attentive as a shadow to the king.</p>

  <p class="normal">The legion cheered Lannon away, their voices ringing from the escarpment of the valley, and Lannon moved through the gates. He stood taller than those that surrounded him. smiling and proud and beautiful.</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked up and saw Huy on the wall, and the smile changed to a quick fierce scowl; ignoring Huy’s hesitant salute he marched out through the gates and took the road that ran southwards into the pass, and over the hills to the middle kingdom.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy watched until the forest hid him from sight, and then he turned away, feeling very alone. He went down to where the slave king lay dying on a bed of dry straw in a corner of Huy’s own tent.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the rising heat of the morning the smell of the wound was the rank, fetid odour of fever swamps and things long dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the old slave women was bathing his body, trying to lower the fever. She looked up as Huy entered and answered his query with a shake of her head. Huy squatted beside the pallet, and touched the slave king’s skin. It was burning hot and dry, and Manatassi moaned in delirium.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Send for a slave-master,’ Huy ordered irritably, ‘Have him strike away these chains.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was amazing to watch the fever eat away the flesh from that huge black frame, to see the bone appear beneath the skin, to watch the face collapse, and the skin change colour from shiny purple black to dry dusty grey,</p>

  <p class="normal">The wound in his groin swelled up hot and hard, with a crusty evil-smelling scab from which a watery greenish-yellow fluid wept slowly. Each hour the slave king’s hold on life seemed to slacken, his body grew hotter, the wound swelled to the size of a man’s bunched fist.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the noon of the second day Huy left the camp alone and climbed to a high place upon the escarpment where he could be alone with his god. Here in the valley of the great river the sun-god’s presence seemed all-pervading and his usually warm benevolent countenance was oppressive. It seemed to fill the entire sky, and to beat down upon the earth like the hammer of a smith upon the anvil.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy sang the prayer of approach, but he did so in a perfunctory fashion, gabbling out the last lines, for Huy was very angry with his gods, and he wanted them to be aware of his displeasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Great Baal,’ he omitted the more flowery titles, and came swiftly to the main body of his protest, ‘following your evident wishes, I have saved this one who bears your marks. Although I do not wish to complain, nor to question your motives, yet you should know that this has been no easy task. I have made serious sacrifices. I have weakened the position of the High Priest of Baal in the king’s favour - I think not of myself, naturally, but only of my influence as your agent and servant. What weakens me, weakens the worship of the gods.’ Huy said this with relish, that must surely catch their attention, and Huy was delighted with it. He felt it was entirely justified, it was high time that certain things were said and that the reciprocal duties of loyalty were stated.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know of old that no command of yours is too difficult of execution, no burden you place upon me but I shoulder it cheerfully, for always I have been secure in the certainty of your wisdom and purpose.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy paused for breath, and thought. He was angry, but he must not let anger run away with his tongue. He had offended the king, best not offend the gods also. Quickly he moderated his closing address.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘However, in the matter of this marked barbarian I have no such certainty. I have saved him at great cost - to what purpose? Is it your intention that he must now die?’ Huy paused again, letting his point sink in.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I ask you now, most humbly,’ Huy spread a drop of honey, ‘most humbly, to make your intentions plain to your always attentive and obedient servant.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy paused once more, should he dare the use of stronger terms? He decided against it, and instead spread both hands in the sun sign and sang the praise of Baal, with all the skill and beauty at his command. The sound of his voice shimmering and aching sweet in the breathless heat-hush of the wilderness was enough to make the gods weep, and when the last pure note had died upon the heated air Huy went down to the camp and with a bronze razor he lanced the grotesque swelling in the slave king’s loin. Manatassi screamed with pain even in his delirium, and the poison gushed out thick yellow and stinking. Huy poulticed the open wound with boiled corn wrapped in a linen cloth, scalding hot to drain the poisons.</p>

  <p class="normal">By evening the fever had passed, and Manatassi lay in exhausted, but natural sleep. Huy stood over him smiling and nodding happily. He felt that he had won this wasted giant, wrested him from death’s dark jaws with prayer and endeavour. He experienced a proud warmth of ownership and when the old slave crone brought him a brimming bowl of good Zeng wine, Huy lifted it in a salute to the sleeping giant.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The gods have given you to me. You are mine. You live under my protection now, and I pledge it to you,’ And he drained the bowl.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The weakness of his body smothered him, pressing him down on the hard mattress of straw. It was an effort to lift head or hand, and he hated his body that had failed him now. He rolled his head slowly and opened his eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Across the tent, on a mat of woven reeds sat the strange little man. Manatassi watched him with a quick flaring of interest. He was stooped over a roll of the strange glowing metal that had been beaten out into a thin pliable length, and <span lang="en-US">with</span> a pointed knife he was scratching and cutting marks into the soft surface. He spent many hours of each day at this unusual activity. Manatassi watched him, noticing the quick nervous birdlike movements of head and hands that set the golden earrings jangling and the thick black plaits of hair dangling down his back.</p>

  <p class="normal">The head seemed too large for the oddly hunched body, and the legs and arms were long and thick and brutal-looking, dark hair grew on the forearms and the back of the long tapered hands - and Manatassi remembered the speed and strength of that body in battle. He lifted his head slightly and glanced down at the linen bandages which swathed his lower body.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the movement Huy was on his feet in one swift movement, and he came to the pallet and stooped over him, smiling.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy said, ‘You sleep like a breastfed baby.’ And Manatassi looked up at him, wondering that a man could speak such a deadly insult to the paramount king of Vendi - and smile as he said it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Aia, bring food,’ Huy shouted for the old slave woman, and settled down on a cushion beside Manatassi’s couch. While Manatassi ate with huge appetite he listened with only a small part of his attention to a ridiculous description of the moon as a white-faced woman. He wondered that such a skilled warrior could be so naive. It was only necessary to look at the moon to see that it was a cake of ground corn, and as the Mitasi-Mitasi the one great god devoured it, so the shape of his bite could clearly be seen cut from the round cake.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you understand this?’ Huy asked with deep concern, and Manatassi answered readily, ‘I understand, high-born.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You believe it?’ Huy insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">I believe it.‘ Manatassi gave the answer which he knew would please, and Huy nodded happily. His efforts to teach the slave king were most rewarding. He had explained the theory of symbolic representation very carefully, showing Manatassi that the moon was not Astarte but her symbol, her coin, her sign and promise. He had explained the waning and waxing as the symbolic subjugation of the female to the male, repeated in the human female by the periodic moon-sickness.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Now, the great god Baal,’ Huy said, and Manatassi sighed inwardly. He knew what was coming. This strange person would now talk about the hole in the sky through which Mitasi-Mitasi made his entrances and exits. He would try to make Manatassi believe that this was a man with a flowing red beard. What a contradictory people they were, these pale ghost-like beings. On the one hand they had weapons and clothes and wonderful possessions and almost magical skills in civil and military matters. He had seen them fight and work, and it had amazed him. Yet these same people could not recognize truths that even the unweaned infants of his tribe understood completely.</p>

  <p class="normal">Manatassi’s first conscious thoughts when he had emerged from the hot mists of fever had been of escape. But now, forced by his weakness into the role of observer, he had time to reconstruct his plans. He was safe here, this hunch-backed manikin wielded some strange power, and he was under its protection. He knew this now. No one would touch him as long as his new master held his shield over him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The other thing he knew was that there was much to learn here. If he could acquire the skills and knowledge of this people, he would be armed a thousand times. He would be the greatest war chief the tribes had ever known. They had used these skills to defeat him, he would defeat them with the same skills that he learned from them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you understand?’ Huy asked earnestly. ‘Do you understand that Baal is the master of the whole of heaven and earth?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I understand,’ said Manatassi.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you accept Astarte and great Baal as gods?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I accept them,’ Manatassi agreed, and Huy looked very pleased.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They have placed their mark upon you. It is right that you should be dedicated to their service. When we reach the city I will perform the ceremony in the temple of great Baal. I have chosen a god-name for you - you will no longer use the old style.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As you wish, high-born.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘From henceforth you will be called Timon.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Timon,’ the slave king tested the sound of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He was the priest-warrior in the reign of the fifth Gry-Lion. A great man.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon nodded, not understanding but content to watch and wait and learn.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘High-born,’ he asked softly, ‘the marks you scratch upon the yellow metal - what are they?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy jumped up and fetched the golden scroll to the couch.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is how we store words and stories and ideas.’ He plunged into an explanation of the writing process, and was rewarded by Timon’s quick grasp of the principle of the phonetic alphabet.</p>

  <p class="normal">On a scrap of leather he wrote Timon’s name in sooty black ink, and in unison they spelled it out aloud, Timon laughing delightedly at his first achievement.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ he thought, ‘there is much to learn here - and so little time.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Across the clay box Caius Terentius Varro, Consul of Rome, fought once more, pressing his legions into Hannibal’s soft centre. The centre gave, with the sucky reluctance of dough, the Spaniards and Gauls there withdrew at Hannibal’s design.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you see it, Timon? The beauty of it, the sheer genius of it!’ Huy called excitedly, speaking in Punic now, manipulating the counters.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And where was Marhabal now?’ Timon demanded as excitedly in the same language. After two years his Punic was fluent, with only the dragging vowels marring its perfection.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He was here,’ Huy touched the cavalry counters, ‘holding his horse on a short rein.’ Timon understood a horse to be a swift animal like a zebra on whose back armed men rode.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Varro is entangled now?’ Timon asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes! Yes! Hannibal has crumpled his front and enveloped him - then what does he do, Timon?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The reserves?’ Timon guessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes! You have it! The Numidians and African reserves.’ Huy was hopping up and down in his agitation. ‘With the timing of the great master, he unleashes them. Taking Varro in the flanks, squeezing him in a vice, packing his ranks so they cannot manoeuvre nor wield their weapons. Then what, Timon, what then?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The cavalry?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ah! The cavalry - Marhabal! The faithful brother. The master of horse, who has waited all that long day. Go! cries Hannibal.’ Huy threw his arm in a wide gesture. ‘Go! My brother, ride with your wild Iberians! They crash into them, Timon. It is the moment, the exact moment. Five minutes earlier it is too soon - five minutes later and it is too late. Timing! Timing! The talent of the great military commander, timing! Of the statesman, the lover, the businessman, the merchant. The right action, at the right time.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the result, high-born, what was the result?’ Timon pleaded, in an agony of suspense. ‘Was it victory?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Victory?’ Huy asked. ‘Yes, Timon. It was victory. Victory and massacre. Eight legions of vaunting Rome wiped out to the man, two entire consular armies.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Eight legions, high-born.’ Timon marvelled. ‘Forty-eight thousand men in a single battle?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘More than that, Timon. The auxiliaries were lost also. Sixty thousand men!’ Huy swept his hand across the board, exterminating the Roman legions. ‘We won the battles, Timon, but they won the wars. Three of them. Three bloody wars, that crushed us—’ Huy broke off. His voice choking. He turned away quickly and went to the water jug. Timon hurried across and held the basin for him while Huy washed his hands and combed his beard. ‘That brings us to the end of our study of Hannibal’s campaigns, Timon. I kept the battle of Cannae for the last.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who will we study next, high-born?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The one who Hannibal himself rated the most skilful general of all history.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who was that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Alexander III,’ Huy said, ‘King of Macedonia, who smashed the Persian Empire - whom the oracle at Delphi <span lang="en-US">proclaimed</span> invincible, and men called the Great.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon held Huy’s cloak for him, and Huy fastened the clasp as he left the precincts of the temple college through the small gate in the inner wall. Timon followed a pace behind him, wearing the short blue tunic of Huy’s household with a light gold chain, dagger and purse belting his waist, the mark of high trust as a body slave. He walked a pace behind Huy’s left shoulder, so as not to mask his master’s sword arm, and he kept his hand on the dagger.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘High-born, the manner in which Hannibal invested Varro?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes?’ Huy encouraged him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Could he not have advanced his flanks, and held his centre firm?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is the difference between defence and offence,’ Huy explained, and they plunged into the discussion of battle tactics and strategy until they left the main gate in the outer wall of the temple area. From here any conversation was impossible, for the crowds spotted this strange couple. Giant black slave and diminutive gnomelike master. They cheered Huy, crowding around him to touch his arm in greeting, to listen to his banter and perhaps receive an alms coin from the purse on Timon’s belt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy loved his popularity. He smiled and joked and pushed his way gently through the press. A successful general - there had been two other campaigns since the great slave-taking - a well-beloved priest, a noted wit and songwriter, and a rich philanthropist (Huy’s investments had prospered exceedingly in the last two years), he was the object of popular adulation throughout the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">They crossed the market-place with its fascinating smells and sights and sounds of hides and humanity, of spices and open sewers. On one of the slave blocks was a light-skinned girl of mixed Yuye blood, and the auctioneer spotted Huy in the crowd and called out to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, a work of art for you. A statue in yellow ivory,’ opening the girl’s cloak to display her body.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy laughed and waved a hand in refusal. They moved along the stone jetty at the lakeside where the ships lay with stern almost touching stern, their hatches open and a boiling of stevedores running over them, loading and unloading the merchandise. From the taverns and wineshops flanking the jetty came the sour stench of cheap wine and gusts of drunken laughter. The street girls beckoned from the narrow lanes between the shops. The uncertain light of dusk softened their raddled features and hectic painted cheeks and lips - Huy wondered what solace a man could find with the likes of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beyond the bustle of the harbour area lay the town houses of the noble families and rich merchants, each protected by the high mud outer wall and a heavy carved wooden gate. Huy’s new residence was one of the least pretentious of these, with the entrance off a narrow walled lane, and a view from the flat roof over the lake.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once through the gate Huy shed his sword and cloak and handed them to Timon with a sigh of pleasure at the moment of homecoming, and he went through into the paved central courtyard.</p>

  <p class="normal">The princes and princesses were waiting tor him, fourteen of them, headed by the twins, Helanca and Imilce. The two of them had grown in the past years, and they were stranded now in that awkward period between girlhood and womanhood. Too young to giggle, yet too old to greet Huy with a kiss.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were no such inhibitions upon the younger members of house Barca, and they swarmed forward to engulf Huy. The religious instruction of the children of the royal house was a duty Huy had imposed upon himself, and despite the estrangement between king and priest, Lannon had not interfered with this arrangement. He had not sanctioned it, but he had not forbidden it. Huy led his students through into the airy living-room of the house.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the courtyard one of the royal nursemaids waited until her charges had followed the priest before she turned and her eyes sought those of Timon. She was a tall girl with strong shoulders, long-waisted and with fruitful hips. Her legs also were straight and strong, but her hands were narrow and pink-palmed and delicately shaped. She wore her hair oiled and dressed in the manner of the Vendi, for she was of Timon’s tribe. Taken in the great raid, she was not slave born, not of the humble dependent breed that had known nothing but captivity. There was a fierce spirit in her to match Timon’s.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her skin was a shade lighter than his, her face was round, moon-shaped, her nose flat and broad, her lips full and pouting, but her teeth were small and even, and very white when she smiled at Timon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon inclined his head sharply in a command, and Sellene the slave girl nodded in acknowledgement. When Timon left the courtyard and went through the kitchens into the slave quarters she followed him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was waiting for her in his own tiny room with its single pallet of reed mat and furs. She went to him without hesitation, and lay against the great hard muscles of his chest and belly and thighs. Her round breasts jutting through the purple tunic of house Barca pressed against Timon.</p>

  <p class="normal">They held their faces together, sniffing softly but eagerly at each other’s eyes and mouth and nostrils, clinging to each other in their need and wanting.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When I hold you, then once again I am King of Vendi, and no slave dog,’ Timon whispered, and the girl groaned against him with her love.</p>

  <p class="normal">With gentle hands that could crush the life from a man Timon loosened her tunic and carried her to the pallet. He laid her upon the bed, and as he came over her he said, ‘You shall be the first of all my wives. You shall be my queen and the mother of my sons.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When shall it be?’ she asked him and her voice shook with the emotions locked within her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Soon,’ he promised. ‘Very soon now. I have what I came for, and I will take you back beyond the river. I shall be the greatest king the tribes have ever known, and you shall be my queen.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I believe you,’ whispered Sellene.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">‘My royal lords and fair ladies.’ The children squealed with glee, it was one of their jokes when Huy addressed them that way. ‘Today I have a special treat for you!’ Again pandemonium broke out. Huy’s treats were usually something special indeed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’ Imilce demanded breathlessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This evening you will meet the oracle of Opet,’ Huy announced, and the uproar subsided swiftly. The small ones not understanding but none the less infected by the solemnity of their elders. The bigger children had heard of the oracle, their nurses often frightened them into obedience with the name. Now that they were about to meet this mythical creature the atmosphere was charged with tension. They were all of them suffering from an onset of the creeps and ghostlies.</p>

  <p class="normal">Anna spoke for all of them when she asked in a very subdued voice, ‘She won’t eat us, will she?’</p>

  <p class="normal">When Tanith came she seated herself amongst them, and threw the hood of her cloak back from her face. She smiled at the children, and said softly, ‘I am going to tell you a story.’ The smile and the promise were enough to ease the tension and they edged in closer to her. ‘It’s the story of the marriage of the great god Baal to the goddess Astarte.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith began the tale from religious mythology which was the basis of the Festival of the Fruitful Earth, a festival celebrated every five years. This year of Opet 538 was the 106th ceremony since the founding of the city, and the following day would begin the festivities that would last for ten days.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith held her young audience enthralled, speaking in the compelling voice which Huy had trained so carefully, using the mannerisms and gestures he had taught her. Huy watched her with an unusual mixture of professional appraisal and the adulation of a besotted lover.</p>

  <p class="normal">In two years she had lost the last traces of gawkiness and uncertainty, and although she was not yet twenty years of age, there was an inner calm, a serenity of mind and expression, that befitted her role of seeress and occult adviser to a nation. No matter that her pronouncements were carefully coached and rehearsed by Huy Ben-Amon, it was she that made the delivery, and made it convincingly. Much of Huy’s material success in the last two years stemmed from the questions and requests for guidance addressed to Tanith by the rich merchants and trading syndicates of Opet - and Tanith’s replies. The supplicants were usually well satisfied with Tanith’s advice, though it was always couched in terms of ambiguity to insure against recriminations. Did it matter that Huy Ben-Amon was also well satisfied?</p>

  <p class="normal">In the same way Huy, despite his loss of the king’s ear, kept a guiding hand on the rudder of the ship of state. Huy was certain that Lannon Hycanus was fully aware of the ultimate source of the advice and guidance which he received from Tanith. In any event, Lannon visited the oracle regularly in her shrine in the grotto beside the silent green pool of Astarte.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the morrow Lannon’s visit to the oracle would be his first official act that would signal the commencement of the Festival of the Fruitful Earth. This was the true reason why Huy had summoned Tanith to his residence. He must brief her carefully on the replies she would make to the king’s queries. Huy knew with a high degree of accuracy what these would be, for his informers were close to the king and again Huy guessed that Lannon intentionally leaked his questions in advance, certain that they would reach Huy and that the replies would come through the oracle.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thinking of Lannon always brought on a mood of deep melancholy. Two years Huy had been without the solace of Lannon’s smile and hand clasp and companionship, and during that time the sharp edge of his loss had not blunted but grown keener. He would wait for hours for a passing glimpse of his old friend, he would pester others for accounts of the banquets at the palace to which he was not invited. On each anniversary of the king’s birth, and also on his throne day Huy had composed a sonnet and sent it with a handsome gift to the palace. The gift had been unacknowledged and the sonnet unsung - as far as he knew.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy tore himself out of this sad mood, and looked instead at his love. The children had crowded her now, silent and big-eyed and intent. Four-year-old Hannibal, named after his illustrious ancestor, had crawled into Tanith’s lap and was sucking his thumb as he stared up into her face.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith’s mask of solemnity had slipped a little, with these children she was childlike, her expression animated and her voice excited. Seeing her thus seemed to add a new dimension to Huy’s feelings for her, and his heart swelled in his chest until it seemed his chest must burst. How much longer must he wait, he wondered, and for what? If it had taken two long carefully planned years to win her confidence, how much longer to win her heart, and having won it what could he hope for - for she was dedicated to the goddess and could never belong to mortal man.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith’s story ended, and the children exclaimed and clamoured for more, besieging her with demands and entreaties and bribery kisses - but Huy feigned outrage, and scolded them while they laughed and clapped their hands with delight. He shouted for the nursemaids and they came -among them that tall, brooding, fiery woman who always made Huy feel disquiet when she looked at him from those unfathomably dark eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">He said to her, ‘Sellene, darkness falls, tell Timon to carry a lamp for you to the palace gate.’ And she acknowledged him with an inclination of the head, showing no gratitude at the order nor resentment either.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the children had gone they ate the evening meal, the three of them, Tanith, Huy and Aina the ancient priestess who was Tanith’s chaperone. Huy had selected her for two good reasons. She was half blind and completely deaf. Huy had tested her by making obscene gestures at her from a range of twenty paces. Aina had shown no reaction, nor had she when Huy crept up behind her and shouted a rude name in her ear. She was just the type of chaperone that Huy wanted.</p>

  <p class="normal">They ate with the lamps trimmed low and the food served by one of the ancient slaves, and when they were finished Huy led Tanith up the outside staircase to the roof and they sat together below the parapet on reed mats and leather cushions. The night wind off the lake was cool and the stars very yellow and bright. Huy crouched over his lute, and strummed softly the rippling tune which he had trained Tanith’s unconscious mind to accept as the signal for hypnotic concentration. Before he had finished the last bars of the tune she was breathing slowly and evenly, her body still and her eyes dark green and unseeing.</p>

  <p class="normal">While his fingers ran over the strings of the instrument, repeating the tune again and again, Huy began to speak. He kept his voice at a monotonous sing-song tone, speaking softly but insidiously and Tanith sat in the starlight and listened with an inner ear.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">On the first day of the 106th Festival of the Fruitful Earth, Lannon Hycanus the forty-seventh Gry-Lion of Opet went in procession to the temple of Astarte to take the oracle.</p>

  <p class="normal">He passed through the enclosure of the temple of Baal where the sacred towers pointed to the sun, guarded by the carved sunbird monoliths, and where the silent populace of the city waited, but when he reached the cleft in the red cliffs that guarded the entrance to the sacred grotto he unbuckled his sword and handed it to his little pygmy huntmaster, his shield and helmet he gave to his armour bearers, and bareheaded and unarmed he entered the opening in the cliff.</p>

  <p class="normal">He passed through the paved tunnel and into the silent beauty of the grotto. The surrounds of the pool were paved with slabs of sandstone and the pool itself was edged with a rounded coping of the same material. Tiers of stone benches rose against the sheer walls of the grotto, and against the far wall the shrine of Astarte was built half into the living rock. Its portals were columned in the Hellenic style, and it contained the cells of the priestesses and the chamber of the oracle.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beyond the stone throne, of the oracle was concealed the entrance to the city archives cut into the rock, and beyond that again, guarded by a massive stone door and the curse of the gods, was the treasury and the tomb of the kings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon paused beside the pool, and the priestesses came forward to meet him and escort him to the edge of the pool. Here they helped him to shed his armour and undergarments.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood tall and naked, golden-headed and beautifully formed, at the head of the steps leading down into the green water. His body was finely muscled as that of a trained athlete, although there was heavy bunched muscle in the shoulders and neck, the mark of the swordsman. His belly and flanks, however, were lean with the shape of muscle beneath the skin but lightly stated. A gilding of red-gold hair ran down from his navel across the flat stomach to explode in a sunny burst of curls in the angle of his legs. The legs were shapely, long and moulded, and balanced his regal bulk easily.</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priestess blessed him, and called down the goddess’s favour upon him. Then Lannon went down the steps and immersed himself in the sacred, life-giving water.</p>

  <p class="normal">While two young novices dried his body and dressed the king in robes of fresh linen, Huy Ben-Amon sang the praise chant to the goddess and when it ended all eyes looked up to the opening in the roof of the cavern high above the green pool.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon called out in a loud voice, ‘Astarte, mother of moon and earth, receive the messenger we send you - and hear our plea with favour.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The throng about the pool lifted their hands high in the sign of the sun, and at the signal the body of the sacrifice plunged from the slab that jutted into the opening in the grotto roof. The wail of the doomed soul echoed briefly about the cavern, until he struck the water and was dragged down swiftly into the green depths by the weight of the chains he wore.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon turned from the pool, and passed between the ranks of the priestesses into the entrance of the shrine. The audience chamber of the oracle was only a little larger than the living-room of a rich man’s house. The lamps burned with a steady light. The flames were tinted an unnatural greenish hue, and the incense of burning herbs was heavy and oppressive. There were draperies beyond the oracle’s throne hanging from roof to flagged floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">The oracle sat upon the throne, a small figure completely swathed in white robes, the face hidden in the shadows of her hood.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon halted in the centre of the chamber and before he spoke he admired for a moment the arrangements that put the interviewer at such a disadvantage. Barefoot, damp from the pool, stripped of weapons and finery, dressed in strange robes and forced to look up at the figure on the throne while he inhaled the subtly drugged air - he must be off balance. Lannon felt his anger stir, and his voice was harsh as he made the formal greeting and asked the first question.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy watched from his place of concealment behind the draperies. He revelled in the closeness of his friend’s physical presence, remembering his mannerisms and voice tones, watching the familiar and well-loved face, smiling at an expected change of expression, the quick smoulder of anger in the pale blue eyes, the quickening of interest at a warning, the glimmer of a smile as he recognized good advice.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith spoke in the same sing-song cadence as Huy had used, picking the answers from the wide selection with which Huy had armed her.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Lannon was finished and would have left the chamber, Tanith’s voice stopped him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is more.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon turned back with surprise, for he was not accustomed to unsolicited - and unpaid for - counsel from the oracle. But Tanith spoke, ‘The lion had a faithful jackal to warn him of the hunter’s approach, but drove the jackal away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The sun had a bird to carry the sacrifices on high, but turned his countenance away from the bird.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The hand had an axe to defend it, but cast the axe aside.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, proud lion! Oh, faithless sun! Oh, careless hand!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Behind the drapery Huy held his breath. It had sounded very clever when he had composed it, but now spoken out in the bare stone chamber it shocked even him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon’s pale eyes seemed to glaze over as he puzzled the riddle, but it was not that subtle and as the import struck him his eyes cleared to the chill sparkle of sapphire and the blood engorged his face and neck.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Damn you, witch,’ he shouted. ‘Must I have it from you also? That cursed priest plagues me at every turn. I cannot walk the streets of my city but I hear the crowds sing his piddling songs. I cannot dine in my own banquet-room but my guests will repeat his empty mouthings. I cannot fight, nor drink a bowl of wine, nor toss a dice but his shadow stands at my shoulder.’ Lannon was panting with anger, as he stamped across the audience chamber and shook his fist in the oracle’s startled face. ‘My children even, he bewitches them also.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Behind the drapes Huy felt his spirits soar on bright wings, this was not an enemy speaking.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He struts and lords it in the streets of my city, his name echoes through my kingdoms.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon’s anger was changing to righteous indignation.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They cheer him when he passes, I have heard it, and, by great Baal, they cheer him louder than they do their own king.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon swung away from the throne, unable to control his agitation. His eyes swept over the draperies and for an instant seemed to stare into Huy’s soul. Huy drew back with a quick intake of breath, but Lannon paced quickly about the chamber before approaching the oracle again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He does all this, mark you, <em>without my favour</em>. He should be an outcast, a—’ He broke off and paced again, and his voice changed, the cutting edge of it dulled, and he said almost inaudibly, ‘How I miss that terrible little man.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy doubted for a moment that the words had been spoken, but almost immediately Lannon’s voice rose in a bellow.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But he defied me. He took from me what was mine, and that I cannot overlook! ’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon whirled and stormed from the shrine. His gentleman-at-arms and his huntmaster saw the expression on his face and they signalled the warnings ahead of the king’s furious progress back to the palace.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">On the final day of the festival Lannon Hycanus prayed in the temple of great Baal, alone in the sacred grove among the towers and the sunbird monoliths. Then he emerged to receive the renewed pledges of loyalty from his subjects. Each of the nine noble families would be represented, as well as the order of priesthood, the guilds of craftsmen and the powerful trading syndicates of the kingdom. They would restate their oaths of allegiance to the throne, and present gifts to the Gry-Lion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy Ben-Amon was absent from the ceremony. Bakmor made the oath for the priesthood and presented the gift. Lannon growled softly at the young warrior priest as he made obeisance before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where is the Holy Father of Ben-Amon?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, I speak for him and all the priests of great Baal.’ Bakmor avoided the question as Huy had coached him, and Lannon could protest no further in the presence of his assembled nobles.</p>

  <p class="normal">The ceremony ended the festival and Opet plunged into an orgy of food and wine and frolic and licence. While Lannon feasted with his nobles in the palace, the commoners thronged the narrow streets singing and dancing. The wine vendors passed freely amongst them, but during the daylight hours the restraint of custom and law checked the behaviour of the crowds. Darkness would bring on the lewd and wanton revels which characterized the festival. In the night the noble matrons and their pretty daughters would slip out, cloaked and hooded, into the streets to join the debauchery - or at the very least to watch it with shining eyes and breathless laughter. For a day and night the rules of society were suspended, and no husband nor wife could demand explanation or accounting from their spouses. It happened but once every five years, and when the festival ended there were wine-sore heads, pale faces and shaking hands, as well as smug and secret smiles.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the middle of the afternoon Lannon was drunk, expansively and happily drunk, as were most of his guests. The banquet-room of the palace was sweltering. The sun beat down fiercely upon the flat mud roof, while the body heat of 500 excited nobles, and the heat from the steaming dishes of rich food turned it into an oven.</p>

  <p class="normal">The roar of voices drowned the valiant efforts of the musicians, and the artistry of the naked girl dancers was impaired by a barrage of ripe grapes aimed by a group of young and noble knights. Hits upon various parts of the girls’ anatomy scored for the marksmen in a contest upon which large ‘ amounts of gold were wagered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deep in wine and talk, Lannon was not aware of the change in the feast until almost complete silence had descended upon the hall. He looked up, frowning quickly, and saw that the musicians’ hands had frozen upon their instruments, the dancers stood paralysed, and the guests gawked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon’s frown deepened to a scowl as he saw Huy Ben-Amon approaching him down the hall. Huy was dressed in a blue tunic with a border of woven gold wire. He wore a gold belt, and a jewelled dagger. His hair and beard were carefully oiled and curled, and golden earrings dangled to his shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">His expression was solemn as he knelt quickly before Lannon, and his voice rang golden and sweet to every corner of the hall.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My king, I come to renew my allegiance to you. Let all men know that I honour you above all things, and my loyalty is unto death and beyond.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon was caught off balance, as Huy had intended. His brain was fuddled with surprise and wine. He fumbled for words, but before he found them, Huy had risen swiftly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As a mark of my faith, I offer a gift.’ He signalled with one hand behind his back, and all heads in the hall swung to the main doors.</p>

  <p class="normal">The towering figure of Timon stalked into the hall, passed down its length and stopped beside Huy. He stared into Lannon’s face with those ferocious smoky eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy whispered, ‘Down!’ And nudged the giant slave, and slowly Timon lowered himself to one knee and bowed his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But he belongs to the gods,’ Lannon challenged harshly. ‘You declared him god-marked, priest.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And Huy gathered his resolve, steeling <span lang="en-US">himself</span> to tell the lie, to commit this sacrilege. Despite the fact that he had already explained it to the gods and to Timon, he was uneasy. It was necessary to regain the king’s favour, Huy had explained, there was but one way of doing so. Lannon was bound by his pride. He could not move to break the deadlock. Huy must make the offer. He asked great Baal for permission to deny the bird-footed marking of the slave. He asked aloud, while pacing the roof of his house in the noon day. A distant muttering of summer thunder had been all the answer Huy needed. The gods had answered, but Huy felt nervous, the answer had been in a very minor key, and not without ambiguity. It was also very difficult for Huy to admit that he was wrong - it jarred the very foundations of his soul.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord,’ said Huy, ‘I was mistaken. The gods have shown me that the markings are not sacred.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon stared at Huy. He shook his head slightly, as though he doubted the evidence of his own ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You mean - you give him to me without reservation? I can have him dispatched immediately, if I wish to?’ He leaned forward staring at Huy, ‘Do you give him to me without conditions?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have declared my love for the king,’ said Huy, and with his foot he nudged Timon.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a great rumbling bass, Timon spoke his lines in near perfect Punic. ‘I come to you as a living proof of that love.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon rocked back on his cushions. He thought about it, and the scowl reappeared, as he saw it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You seek to chain me! There are still conditions - only better concealed,’ he growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nay, my lord. Not chains, but the silken threads of friendship,’ Huy told him softly. They held each other’s eyes, Lannon beginning to flush with anger. Huy steady and calm.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then suddenly Huy’s face cracked, and the dark eyes sparkled. The ringlets on his cheeks began to dance with suppressed laughter. Lannon opened his mouth to bellow at him, to reject the gift and the offer of friendship. Instead, laughter rattled up his throat and burst from his open lips. He laughed, until the tears poured down his cheeks and between gusts of laughter he moaned with the pain of his aching belly muscles.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fly for me, bird of the sun,’ he sobbed, and Huy flopped down beside him on the cushions and shook and quivered with laughter.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Roar for me. Lion of Opet,’ he cried and a slave girl filled a wine bowl and brought it to him. Huy quaffed half of it, then passed the bowl to Lannon. He drained it. A little wine ran from the comers of his mouth into his golden beard. He smashed the bowl on the stone floor, then clasped Huy about the shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have wasted much time, my Sunbird. Let us make up for it. What shall we do first?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Drink,’ said Huy,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ah!’ cried Lannon. ‘And then what?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hunt’, suggested Huy, choosing those activities dearest to the king.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hunt!’ Lannon echoed. ‘Send for my huntmasters - we march tomorrow to hunt the elephant!’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">‘Astarte, mother of earth, your beauty is multiplied until it floods my soul,’ muttered Huy, swaying gracefully, as he looked up at the night sky. He reeled backwards, but fell against a wall. It steadied him, and he went on studying the astronomical phenomena in the heavens. Four silver moons hung above the night-revelling city. Huy closed one eye, and three of the moons vanished - he opened it and they reappeared.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Astarte, guide your servant’s footsteps,’ Huy entreated, pushed himself away from the wall and went on down the narrow lane towards the harbour. He stumbled over a body lying in the shadows, and stooped unsteadily to check for signs of life.</p>

  <p class="normal">The body snored and grunted as he rolled it onto its back, and a warm fruity gust of winey breath came up to Huy. It reminded him of the recumbent figures he had left strewn about the banquet hall at the palace. Lannon chief among them, smiling as he slept.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tonight you are in good company, citizen of Opet,’ Huy chuckled, and went tottering onwards down the lane. In an angle of the wall a dark shape moved. Huy peered at it curiously, saw one body, two heads, heard broken gusty breathing, soft incoherent cries. The movements were small, but unmistakable. Huy smiled, tripped and nearly fell. He saw a startled girl’s face turn towards him from the gloom. ‘Let all things be fruitful,’ he told her solemnly and went on, and as he went another figure slipped silently from the dark lane and followed Huy. The figure was cloaked and hooded in rough woven brown cloth, and its movements were stealthy and deliberate</p>

  <p class="normal">The quayside of the harbour was crowded with revellers, and there were bonfires burning here. The reflections of the flames smeared ruddy and bright upon the still black waters <span lang="en-US">of</span> the lake. Around them, arms linked in a circle, danced the crowds. Some of the women were past all restraint, stripped naked to the waist, spilled wine snaking down their white bodies like blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy stopped to watch them a while, and the following figure hung back, mingling with the throng of merrymakers.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Huy started forward, the cloaked figure hurried forward also. The lane that led up to Huy’s house was in deep darkness, but a lamp burned dimly in a niche above the gate, left there to welcome the master home.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Huy groped his way towards the light, the following figure closed with him silently and swiftly. The blundering sounds of his own progress blanketed the rustle of cloth and the light footfalls behind him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy reached the gate, and he stood in the dim lamplight. His dagger was under his cloak, and his sword hand reached out for the latch of the gate. In that instant while he was unready and off balance, the dark figure flew at him from out of the darkness. A hand closed on his wrist, and he was thrown back against the wall beside the gate. Wine had slowed his reflexes, he twisted bis face upwards in surprise and alarm. He saw the dark figure, with its face hidden in the recesses of the hood, come at him - and before he could shout soft lips were pressed against his, and a little muffled chuckle broke through these lips into his startled mouth - and he felt warm breasts and thighs moving against him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shock of it paralysed Huy. For long seconds he stood utterly still while lips and cunning hands teased and goaded him. Then with a hoarse cry he reached for the taut warm woman shape, and immediately it was gone, slipping away beyond his reach.</p>

  <p class="normal">He lunged for it wildly, his hands groping air, and the shape danced away, swirled through the gateway into Huy’s house and slammed the gate closed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Cursing desperately, Huy struggled with the gate, wrenched it open at last and ran into the entrance court.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a flash of dark movement across the court, disappearing into the house, and Huy raced after it, tripped over a cushion and fell full length, knocked over a stool on which a house slave had left an amphora and wine bowl. They shattered loudly, splashing wine across the mud floor. A mocking whisper of laughter, from the dim recesses of the house, sent Huy scrambling to his feet and charging onwards. He saw the cloaked figure silhouetted against the lamplit doorway of his sleeping quarters.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wait!’ he shouted. ‘Who are you?’ And his house slaves roused by the uproar came running, still halt asleep, panicky and hastily armed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Be gone!’ Huy shouted at them furiously. ‘All of you - the first one I catch out of his room before morning, I will have flogged.’ And they retreated to their quarters, not seriously alarmed by the threat. Huy maintained his dignity until the last of them had disappeared, then he turned and charged towards the doorway of his sleeping quarters.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a night lamp burning here also, on a low stool beside his bed. The wick was trimmed low, a soft orange puddle of light which left the farthest reaches of the room in darkness. Beside the lamp stood the cloaked woman. She stood motionless and the face within the hood was completely hidden although Huy thought he caught the sheen of reflected light off watching eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">The force of Huy’s charge carried him half across the room, but in the wrong direction. He swung towards her, and at that moment she stooped and snuffed the lamp flame. The room was plunged into darkness, and Huy’s charge ended against the wall. He gathered himself quickly, he was sobering fast now, and he crouched beside the wall listening.</p>

  <p class="normal">He heard the rustle of cloth, and he pounced. His fingers closed on a hem of the cloak. There was a muted shriek of surprise, and the fold of material was plucked from his fingers. He swore bitterly, and with arms widespread groped like a blind man about the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">He sensed movements near him, the lightest breathing, the softest stirring in the darkness. He reached out quickly, and his fingers brushed against smooth skin. He recognized the shape of a nude back, and the plump warm bulge of a buttock. A soft chuckle and it was gone again. Huy froze with his heart hammering at his ribs, and his physical arousal making him momentarily dizzy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whoever she was, she had discarded the cloak. He was alone with a woman who was elusive as a darting lake pike, and as naked as a newborn babe. Like a stalking leopard he went alter her, stripping his own tunic and breech clout as he went, dropping them carelessly on the floor, until, except for the gold rings in his ears, he was as bare as his own passion.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was panicky in the darkness now, unable to control the gasps and nervous giggles. And Huy hunted her by ear, closing in on her, driving her into the corner beside the bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">She nearly escaped again, ducking under his searching hands but one of his long arms whipped around her waist and he lifted her easily. She squealed now, kicking like a captive animal, her fists beating against his face and chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">He carried her to the thick pile of furs that made up his bed.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Huy woke with a sense of peace, a feeling of deep happiness.</p>

  <p class="normal">His body seemed softened and enervated, but his mind was clear and sharply focused. The soft pinks of dawn suffused his chamber and the cry of the winging lake birds carried clearly to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He raised himself on one elbow and looked down at the girl who slept beside him in the storm-tossed bed. She had cast aside her covering in the warm spring night. Her hair was moist at the temples, and a fine sheen of moisture shone on her softly pouting upper lip. Her eyes were closed, and she slept so lightly that her breathing barely stirred the mass of soft dark hair which lay upon her cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">One arm was thrown over her head, pulling the surprisingly large breasts out of shape. Her breasts were big and full and round for the long slim length of her body, and the tips were still flushed dark red from the loving of the night. Her skin was smooth and pale creamy olive, with violent puffs of black silky hair in her armpits and at the base of her belly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy saw all of this in his first startled glance, before his eyes fastened on her calm and sleeping face.</p>

  <p class="normal">Incredulously Huy stared at her, all sound locked away in his throat. He felt horror, and awe, and superstitious terror.</p>

  <p class="normal">The girl opened her eyes, and saw him and smiled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Baal’s blessings on you, Holy Father,’ she said softly,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tanith!’ gasped Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, my lord.’ She was still smiling.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is sacrilege, Huy whispered. ’This is an offence against the goddess.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">‘To deny my love for you would have been an offence against all nature.’ Tanith sat up on the bed, and kissed him without remorse, without the least sign of guilt.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Love?’ Huy asked, his misgivings temporarily forgotten.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, my lord,’ Tanith nodded, and kissed him again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But—’ Huy stuttered, and his cheeks turned bright as bush fires. ‘You cannot - how can you love me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How can I not, my lord?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But my body - my back.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Your back I love because it is part of you, part of your goodness and kindness and wisdom.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He stared at her for many seconds, then clumsily he took her in his arms and buried his face in the fragrant dark cloud of her hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Tanith,’ he whispered. ‘What are we going to do?’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Huy stood on the hilltop in the dawn and waited for his god. Below him the camp stirred. The cooking fires paled in the growing light of day. Small sounds carried up to him, the sounds of 6,000 men preparing for the hunt. The 6,000 warriors of Huy’s legion, and the king’s train, and the slaves and the women and the elephants and the baggage train. Small wonder that the camp filled the entire valley on both sides of the small river that flowed down the escarpment of the hills. Thirty miles away to the north lay the sluggish green ribbon of the great river, sweltering in its hot and inhospitable valley. One of Lannon’s legions was camped there already, and for days now they had been harassing the elephant herds that were feeding along the river. They had attacked them with archers, and javelin-throwers and war elephants.</p>

  <p class="normal">Under this harassment the herds would leave the valley, taking to their ancient roads out over the escarpment. Lannon was encamped now astride these well-blazed trails, and scouts from the valley had reported the previous evening that the herds were already on the move. They were massing and moving in towards the escarpment wall, and in the next few days <span lang="en-US">they</span> would come pouring up out of the valley in long majestic files, as the old bulls led them to sanctuary from the persistent hunters who plagued them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy Ben-Amon pondered this as he stood in the dawn. He wore light hunting armour and running sandals, and he leaned comfortably on the shaft of the vulture axe. The splendid blade was covered with a soft leather sheath to protect the finely honed edge and the delicate engravings. It seemed to Huy that the gods had so arranged circumstances as to provide him with this opportunity.</p>

  <p class="normal">For two weeks, ever since that last night of the Festival of the Fruitful Earth, Huy had spent most of his waking moments pondering his dilemma. He had spent hours poring over the sacred books, examining the roles of priest and priestess, their duties and relationship to the gods, and to each other. He thought that from all this research he had built up a case for his behaviour. He could not bring himself to call it sacrilege. He had come now to plead his case, and to receive judgement.</p>

  <p class="normal">The sun shot its first golden lance against the crest of the hill, and Huy sang the praise chant with all the beauty at his command. Then he made his plea. It was complicated dialectic, based on the concept of earthly representation, and amounting to a line of reasoning which supposed that what was good behaviour between Baal and his mate Astarte would be equally justifiable between their earthly representatives -although, of course, not between a priestess and any other person than the High Priest of Baal. Huy glossed over the more evidently weak spots in his case.</p>

  <p class="normal">He ended, ‘It may be, however, great Baal and heavenly Astarte, that I am mistaken in my reasoning. It may well be that I have sinned. If this is the case then I deserve your full wrath and, despite my life of service and faithful duty, I deserve the most dire punishment! ’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy paused tor effect. ‘I go now to hunt the elephant. I swear on my life that wherever the chase is hottest, there I shall be. Wherever the danger is deadliest, there I shall be.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It I have sinned - then let the tusked beasts strike me down. If I have not sinned then let me live and return to the bosom of your priestess. If you grant me life and love - I swear my duty and service will last to the end of my days, and no man nor woman will ever know of the dispensation you have granted me.’ He was quiet a while longer then he spoke again, ‘You who have loved, take pity on one who loves also.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy came down the hill well satisfied with his bargain. He would give the gods full measure. He would not hang back in distaste <span lang="en-US">from</span> the slaughter today, the gods would have every opportunity to demonstrate their outrage. In any event, Huy was well aware that only death could keep him out of Tanith’s arms. The taste of that fruit had been too sweet for him ever to deny it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Huy,’ Lannon shouted as Huy entered the camp. ‘Where have you been?’ He was armed and striding impatiently back and forth outside his tent. He came towards Huy quickly. ‘The day wastes away,’ he cried. ‘Already from the hills our lookouts have seen the approach of the herds.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The war elephants were ready, drivers sitting on their necks and the tall castles on their backs. Lannon’s hunting party was assembled about the tent. Among them Huy noticed some of the king’s most renowned huntmasters: Mursil, with his purple boozy face, the lean and saturnine Zadal, Huya the celebrated bowman, and the diminutive yellow Xhai whose fame as a tracker had grown apace in the last few years. Beyond them amongst the horde of body slaves towered the colossal black bulk of Timon. Huy smiled at him, and then he hurried beside Lannon to the elephant lines.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon told him, ‘You will ride with me, Sunbird.’ And Huy replied, ‘I am honoured, my lord.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mursil handed Huy one of the elephant bows. Few men could draw these massive weapons. Carved from solid baulks of wild ebony, they were as thick at the centre as a man’s wrist and strung with twisted strands of lion gut. It required immense strength in the arms and chest to draw one of the five-foot arrows that were armed with a heavy steel head and flighted with wild duck feathers. However, once drawn to the limit and loosed, they could fly 100 paces and bury the arrow up to its feathers in the living flesh of an elephant. They could reach the mighty heart in its castle of ribs, they could cut deep into the massive pink lungs, or loosed with skill they could cut through the ear-hole in the great bony skull and find the brain.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know you prefer the bow to the spear, Holy Father,’ Mursil murmured respectfully. ‘As for me, my old arm can no longer draw.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank you, huntmaster.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The quivers are full. I have tested and selected each of the arrows,’ Mursil assured him, and Huy followed Lannon to where his war elephant knelt. It was a rangy old cow, more steady than the bull in the heat of battle, more reliable and even-tempered than the bull in the hunt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy followed Lannon up into the castle. There was room for three men in the wooden box. The arrow quivers were fitted to the outside, but with the arrow-heads standing up ready to the hand. The javelins were racked on the front of the castle and Lannon selected one and tested it thoughtfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A nice balance,’ he judged it, and then looked down to where his huntmasters waited anxiously, each of them eager for the honour of riding with the Gry-Lion. Lannon glanced over them, but his eye stopped on Xhai. He nodded, and with pathetic gratitude the pygmy scrambled up the elephant’s side.</p>

  <p class="normal">With a heavy lurch that threw Huy against <span lang="en-US">the edge</span> of the castle, the elephant came up on its feet. They looked down from the majestic height of nearly eighteen feet, and the driver goaded the old cow into a stately swaying walk. They took the trail down towards the escarpment of the valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have selected a good place for it,’ Lannon told Huy. ‘Where the steep path comes out suddenly into a small flat bowl. We will wait for them there.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy looked back and saw the other war elephants following them. Twenty of them in single file, ears flapping, trunks swinging they trundled sedately along. The huntsmen in the castles were checking and testing their weapons, and chattering excitedly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For what do we hunt, my lord?’ Huy asked. ‘Calves or ivory?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Calves first. The elephant trainers have asked for two dozen youngsters between five and ten years old. We will capture those this morning, for it will be the breeding herds that come up out of the valley first. Then later we will hunt for ivory. The scouts report many fine bulls scattered along the great river.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The saucer which Lannon had selected was hemmed in with steep broken ground. It was circular in shape, perhaps 500 paces across. The elephant road came into it through a narrow rocky pass, crossed the saucer and climbed out of it up a steep pitch to the high ground above. The saucer was thickly wooded, and Lannon placed his war elephants in ambush, concealing them about the perimeter of the bowl in the good cover. The war elephants were forced to kneel for better concealment, and while they waited Huy and Lannon breakfasted on cold corn cakes, cheese and roast salt beef washed down with red wine. It was a hunter’s meal, taken in cover with the mounting excitement of the chase sharpening their appetites, and as they ate they kept glancing up at the lookouts on the high ground above the saucer whose task it was to watch for and to signal the approach of the herds.</p>

  <p class="normal">The dew was still on the grass when a figure waved frantically from the skyline above them, and Lannon grunted with satisfaction and wiped the grease from his fingers and lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come, my Sunbird,’ he said, and they mounted the kneeling elephant once more.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a long wait that stretched and tightened their nerves, then suddenly little Xhai stirred expectantly beside Huy and bis dark amber eyes snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are here,’ he whispered, and almost immediately a single wild elephant came out through the rocky portals of the pass and paused on the lip of the saucer. It was an old cow, grey and lean and tuskless. Suspiciously she looked about the saucer, lifting her trunk to sample the air and then blowing the sample into her mouth against the olfactory glands in her upper lip. The breeze was behind her, a soft dry movement of air that carried the smell of waiting men away from her, and she lowered her trunk and moved forward.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the pass behind her poured an avalanche of great grey bodies.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Breeding herd,’ murmured Lannon, and Huy saw the calves at heel. They ranged in size from almost full grown to not much bigger than a large pig. The smaller they were the more noisy and mischievous, squealing and frolicking and chasing between the legs of their mothers. Huy smiled at the attempts of one to suckle from his moving mother, groping for the teats between her front legs with his miniature trunk until in exasperation the mother picked up a fallen branch and swatted him mercilessly across the rump. The calf squealed and fell in at her heels again, demure and chastened.</p>

  <p class="normal">The saucer was full of wild elephants now, their grey humped backs showing above the thick bush as they streamed along the ancient road to safety.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon leaned forward and touched the driver on the shoulder, and the war elephant rose beneath them lifting them high so that they could look down from their castle upon the quarry. All around the saucer, the war elephants rose from cover with the armed men upon their backs. They closed in on the herd quietly, the squealing and uproar from the calves blanketing their approach until they were right in amongst the herd.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon selected a young cow with a half-grown calf and leaning out from the castle he hurled his javelin into her neck, aiming for the great arteries there. The cow squealed in pain and alarm, and bright red arterial blood blew in a cloud from the tip of her trunk. She reeled backwards, mortally wounded, and from the other castles a torrent of missiles flew into the herd. Hundreds of huge bodies burst into flight and the forest shook and rang with their trumpeting and their frantic efforts at escape.</p>

  <p class="normal">Despite his promise to the gods, Huy did not raise his bow, but watched in awful fascination the slaughter of the terrified beasts. He saw an old cow, bristling with arrows and javelins charge one of the war elephants and knock it down on its knees; the men were hurled from the castle to fall beneath stampeding hooves, and the old cow tottered away to fall and die, still in her battle rage. He saw a calf, hit in error, trying to tear the arrow from its own flank and squealing pitifully as the barbs clung stubbornly in the flesh. He saw another calf attempting vainly to rouse its dead mother, tugging at her with its little trunk.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon was shouting with excitement, hurling his javelins into the neck and spine with that deadly accuracy that dropped the great grey bodies in profusion about them.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the herd mothers charged them from the side; a bad-tempered old queen as big and as strong as their mount, she bore down on them. Lannon swung to face her, braced himself and threw, but the old queen lifted her trunk and the javelin struck it squarely, biting deep into that pulpy sensitive member just below the level of her eyes. She squealed in agony but never faltered in her run, and regretfully Huy lifted his bow. He knew she would charge home, and that only death would stop her.</p>

  <p class="normal">The old queen lifted her head and trunk high, bracing herself for the impact of her charge. Her mouth was wide open, with the pointed lower lip dangling, and Huy drew and loosed his shaft into the back of her throat. All five feet of the arrow disappeared into her gaping mouth, and he knew the point had found the brain for she reeled back onto her haunches, shuddering and quivering, a strangled gurgling cry bubbling from her throat. The lids of her eyes twitched violently and she fell forward and was still.</p>

  <p class="normal">They killed forty-one cows, thirty of them with calf. However, nine of the calves were adjudged by the trainers too young for survival as orphans and they were put down with a single merciful arrow. The others were cut out and rounded up by specially trained nursing cows and led away from the mountainous bleeding carcasses of their mothers. By noon the work was done, and the slaves could busy themselves in butchering the carcasses and carrying the meat away to the smoking racks. The saucer was a reeking charnel-house, and the vultures turned overhead in a dark cloud that almost obscured the sun.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon ate the midday meal with his nobles and hunt-masters. Fresh grilled elephant tripe seasoned with hot pepper sauce, broiled elephant heart stuffed with wild rice and olives, platters of golden corn cakes and the inevitable earthen amphorae of Zeng wine made it a meal fit for a hunter’s appetite.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon was in a high good humour, striding amongst his men, laughing and jesting with them, picking out one or another for a special commendation. He was still wrought up by the excitement of the chase, and when he paused beside Huy he meant to chaff him when he said:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My poor Sunbird, you loosed but one arrow during the whole hunt.’ And Huy was about to answer lightly that one arrow for one elephant was as good a score as any, when suddenly Zadal the huntmaster from the middle kingdom laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Was the bow too strong for you, Holiness, or the game too fierce?’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was sudden and deathly silence on the entire group, and all their faces turned towards the lean dark man with the thin sneering mouth and bright acquisitive eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took a few seconds of the silence for Zadal to realize what he had said, then he glanced quickly about the circle of watching faces. With a small chill he saw they were looking at him with that same detached curious expression that men looked upon those doomed to sacrifice. Beside him a noble said softly but matter of factly, ‘You are a dead man.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Swiftly, with real alarm, Zadal looked back at Huy Ben-Amon. Too late he recalled the reputation of this priest. It was said that no man still lived who had sneered at his back or his height or his courage. With relief he saw that the priest was smiling slightly, and delicately wiping his fingers on the hem of his tunic.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank you, great Baal’, Huy prayed silently, smiling a little. ‘It was right that you remind me of my promise. I held back from the hunt. Forgive me, great Baal. I will give you your chance now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Zadal’s relief was shortlived for when Huy looked directly at him he saw the smile was on the priest’s lips only. His eyes were bright and black and cold.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Zadal,’ Huy said softly, and the crowd pressed closer to hear his words. ‘Will you fly with me on the wings of the storm?’</p>

  <p class="normal">They stirred at the challenge, a quick buzz of comment and they watched Zadal’s face. It had paled to a dirty yellow, and his lips compressed into a thin white line.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I forbid it,’ said Lannon loudly. ‘I will not let you do this, Huy. You are too valuable to me to waste your life in—’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy interrupted him quietly, ‘Majesty, it is a matter of honour. This one called me coward.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But no man has hunted in that manner for fifty years,’ Lannon protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fifty years is too long,’ Huy smiled, ‘is it not, Zadal? You and I will revive the custom.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Zadal stared at him, hating his own unruly tongue.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy still smiled at him. ‘Or is it that the game is too fierce for you?’ he asked softly. For long moments it seemed that Zadal might refuse, then he nodded curtly, his lips still white.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As you wish, Holiness.’ And he knew they were right, he was a dead man.</p>

  <p class="normal">In two large baskets, slaves had collected from one of the elephant carcasses the contents of the lower intestines. As Huy and Zadal, stripped naked, smeared their bodies with the yellow dung he overheard young Bakmor discussing the hunt with Mursil.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not believe it is possible to kill a full-grown bull elephant with a battle-axe. It sounds to me like an unpleasant form of suicide.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s why they call it flying on the wings of the storm.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The elephant dung had a rank odour, strong enough to mask the man smell. It was the one protection the hunters would have. Their one chance of getting into close contact with the great beasts without being discovered. The sharp sense of smell of the elephant is its main defence, for its vision is weak and near sighted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon came over <span lang="en-US">from</span> the king’s entourage and assisted Huy, spreading the dung across his back. Quickly Timon had understood the method that they would use.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘High-born, I fear for you,’ he said softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">I fear for myself,‘ Huy admitted. ’Spread the dung thickly, Timon. I would prefer to stink, rather than die.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy looked down the steep slope which stretched down into the valley from the saucer. The elephant road zig-zagged up through the sparse forest. They would intercept the next herd here, before it was alarmed by the smell of blood in the saucer.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy glanced around him and saw that the huntsmen had spread out along the ridge, selecting vantage points from which to view the sport. His eyes met those of Zadal. The huntmaster was daubed with the yellow filth from his head to his feet, and he gripped the handle of his axe too hard. There was fear in those dark eyes, and tear in the taut manner in which he held himself. Huy smiled at him, enjoying his discomfort, and Zadal looked away. His lips quivered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you ready, huntmaster?’ Huy asked, and Zadal nodded. He could not trust his voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come,’ said Huy, and started down the slope, but Lannon stepped into his path. There was a foreboding in his eyes, and his smile was unconvincing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That fool Zadal spoke in haste and without meaning it. No man here doubts your courage, Huy, except you yourself. Do not seek to prove it too convincingly. Life will hold little for me without my Sunbird.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord,’ Huy’s voice was hoarse. He was touched to the heart by Lannon’s concern.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The first cut is the dangerous one, Huy. Be careful that when he drops, he does not fall upon you’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will remember.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Remember also to bathe before you dine with me this evening.’ Lannon smiled and stepped aside.</p>

  <p class="normal">Twice during the afternoon small herds of elephant passed them, moving swiftly up the slope amongst the trees. Each time Huy shook his head at Zadal and let them pass for they were cows and calves and immature bulls.</p>

  <p class="normal">The day drew towards its close, and Huy felt an uneasy sense of relief. Perhaps the gods had decided in his favour and would not seek to put him to the test.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an hour of light left now. Huy and Zadal sat quietly beside the path, hidden by a screen of monkey apple vines that hung <span lang="en-US">from</span> one of the trees.</p>

  <p class="normal">The dung had dried upon their bodies, making Huy’s skin feel stiff and uncomfortable. He sat with the vulture axe across his lap and watched the path, hoping that nothing would come up it before darkness and he could abandon this mad adventure to which he was committed by honour and hasty choice. It was strange how inactivity dulled even the brightest passion, Huy thought, and grinned wryly as he fondled the handle of the axe.</p>

  <p class="normal">He saw movement far down the slope, a grey drifting movement like smoke amongst the trees and he felt his skin prickle. Zadal had seen it also, he stopped his restless fidgeting and sat woodenly beside Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">They waited, and suddenly two elephants came out of the trees. Two big old bulls, with heavy ivory, stepping lightly up the slope. They were a hundred paces apart, spaced out on the path and there was an alertness and a sense of purpose in their tread that warned Huy they had been freshly disturbed, possibly wounded, by the huntsmen down in the valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will take these two,’ Huy whispered. ‘Choose one.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Zadal</em> was silent a moment, watching the two bulls with an experienced eye. The leading bull was older, and his one tusk was broken off at the lip. He was leaner and rangier-looking than his companion, and his leading position showed he was the more experienced, the more alert, and the broken tusk would make him meaner and his temper more uncertain.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The second one,’ Zadal whispered, and Huy nodded. He had expected it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will move back now. We must try to attack at the same moment.’ He left the cover of the hanging vines, and slipped back along the path opening a gap between him and Zadal approximately equal to that between the bulls.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy dropped into a patch of coarse grass beside the trail, and looked back. The elephants were striding steadily up towards them. The leading bull passed Zadal’s hiding place, and came on. Huy saw that the gap between the two bulls had closed. Zadal’s elephant would reach him before Huy’s came level with the clump of grass where he lay.</p>

  <p class="normal">If one of the hunters launched his attack prematurely the other bull would be alerted, and the danger multiplied many times. Huy knew he could not rely on consideration from Zadal. The man would think only of his own best interests.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the thought came to him he saw Zadal leave the shelter of the vines, and run silently out into the path behind the second bull. Huy’s elephant was still fifty paces from where he lay, and it was facing him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Zadal was following his elephant, running close upon its heels. Huy felt a moment’s admiration for him. Perhaps he had misjudged him. Perhaps Zadal would follow the second bull and wait for Huy to get into position.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Huy saw the huntmaster’s axe go up and glint at the top of its swing; as it flashed down, Huy transferred all his attention to the leading bull.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a squeal of pain and alarm as Zadal’s axe struck, and Huy’s bull burst into a full run. Sweeping down on him until it seemed to fill the whole field of Huy’s vision, an animal as large as the very path it sprang from.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Huy rose from his hide he knew he had a <span lang="en-US">few</span> fleeting seconds in which to strike. The the bull would be gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">He went bounding along beside the bull, keeping uphill of him for when he fell he would roll down the slope. The pace stretched Huy’s long legs to the full, and he was losing ground swiftly, falling back to the bull’s hindquarters.</p>

  <p class="normal">With every pace, as the huge weight of the grey body fell on the hind legs, so the hamstring tendons running down the back of the leg from knee to heel tightened under the coarse eroded skin. The tendon was a thick cord, that flexed and bulged, thick as a girl’s wrist; it carried the whole weight of the bull at each stride.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy swerved in his ran, crossing behind the bull and as the tendon in the nearest leg tightened he slashed the blade of the vulture axe across it, severing it cleanly so that the sound of it was a sharp snapping, like the sheet of a sail parting in a gale.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bull lunged off balance as the leg collapsed under him, he teetered wildly on the edge of the path, his weight held only on the good leg.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For Baal!’ Huy shouted with excitement and the axe went high as he swung. The second tendon parted as sharply, and the huge grey beast dropped heavily. The sound of its fall carried clearly to the watchers on the ridge, and a cloud of dust boiled up from the dry earth. Huy had danced back from under the rolling body and that terrible <span lang="en-US">flailing</span> trunk.</p>

  <p class="normal">He steeled himself for the final act. as he danced about the rearing floundering animal, knowing he had only seconds to exploit his surprise, seconds before the maimed animal braced itself and saw him, and he searched for his opening desperately.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bull reared up on its front legs, dragging its crippled hind legs behind it. In its unreasoning rage it was tearing at the trees, and slashing its terrible trunk in wild circles, gouging the earth with its single tusk.</p>

  <p class="normal">But its back was turned to Huy, <em>it</em> had not recognized its attacker yet. Lightly Huy ran in, ducking under the <span lang="en-US">flailing</span> trunk. He vaulted up on the bull’s wide back, landing on his knees with the axe high above his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">The knotted spine stood out clearly through the wrinkled dry skin, great knuckles of bone braced for the blade. Huy struck, the killing stroke that crashed through the bone, and severed the soft yellow core of the spinal tissue. The bull shrieked, and collapsed, kicking and shaking spasmodically in its death throes,</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy jumped down from its pulsating body and danced back out of danger from the legs and trunk of the dying beast. He felt a soaring sense of triumph and relief. It was done, he had flown upon the wings of the storm - and lived through it.</p>

  <p class="normal">He heard the wild shrill trumpeting of the other bull, and he spun around. One glance showed him that the task was not yet completed, the gods were not finished with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Zadal had blundered. His second cut had missed the tendon and the bull was on three legs, but moving with agility and speed as it hunted the man. Zadal had thrown his axe aside, and was running, dodging up the slope with the bull close upon him. The bull was shrieking with rage, its trunk outstretched, gaining swiftly on the fleeing man.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Huy started forward it caught him. It wrapped its trunk around Zadal’s body and flung him high in the air, above the tops of the tallest trees and his body spun loosely in the air. He fell face down on the rocky earth, and the bull placed one foot in the small of his back while with its trunk it plucked his head from his body, the way a farmer kills a chicken, and it tossed the head aside. It bounced and rolled down the slope like a child’s ball.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy ran towards the bull, scrambling up the slope. The bull knelt on the mangled corpse and drove one tusk through Zadal’s chest. It was so preoccupied with the mutilation of Zadal’s body that Huy came up easily behind it.</p>

  <p class="normal">He saw the deep gash in the back of the bull’s knee where Zadal’s stroke had failed to find the tendon, and the vulture axe moaned softly in flight. This time there was no mistake.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">‘I give you a new title.’ Lannon lifted his wine bowl, and silence fell expectantly on the nobles and knights who sat about his board. I give a battle honour for the man who has flown on the wings of the storm.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy dropped his eyes modestly, blushing a little in the torch light under the leather awning of Lannon’s campaign tent.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Huy Ben-Amon - Axeman of the Gods!’ Lannon shouted the title, and the nobles echoed it, saluting Huy with clenched fists.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Drink. Huy! Drink, my Sunbird!’ Lannon offered Huy his own wine bowl. Huy sipped the wine, smiling around at the company. Tonight he would not look too deeply into the wine bowl. He did not want to cloud or befuddle this sense of joy. The gods had answered him. and he sat quietly smiling in the midst of noisy revelry, hardly hearing the laughter and the banter, listening instead to the voice deep inside him which sang, Tanith! Tanith!‘</p>

  <p class="normal">When he rose to leave, Lannon was outraged, dragging him down into his seat by the hem of his tunic.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ll not leave here on your feet, Axeman. You deserve to be carried to your couch this night! Come, I challenge you to a bout with the wine cups.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy shrugged aside the challenge, laughing and shaking his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘One challenge a day, my lord, I beg of you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Outside the night was still, and the sky was brilliant with the stars. The heat of the day was cooling, and the feel of the night wind in his face was like the caress of Tanith’s silky tresses against his cheek.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Astarte!’ The goddess rose out of the valley, the golden disc of her countenance lighting the land with a soft radiance. ‘Mother of earth, I thank you,’ Huy whispered, and felt the tears of happiness flood his eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">He moved on through the camp towards his own tent, hugging the warmth of his love secretly to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith,‘ he whispered, ’Tanith.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">He moved on through the shadows until movement caught his attention, and he stopped. Beside one of the cooking fires crouched a figure, a slave woman working on the grinding stone, crushing corn for cakes.</p>

  <p class="normal">The firelight caught her handsome features, and shone on the dark skin of her strong arms. It was the nurse Sellene.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy was about to move on, when the slave girl looked up expectantly. A man came towards her out of the darkness, and the girl’s face lit with such a look of adoration, such unashamed love, that Huy felt his heart go out to her</p>

  <p class="normal">The man stepped into the firelight, and it needed only one glance at the powerful body and rounded bald head for Huy to recognize Timon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sellene stood up and went quickly to meet Timon, and they embraced. Then sniffed at each other’s face in the strange love greeting of the pagans, holding each other closely. Huy smiled tenderly, feeling the warm sympathy of the lover for all other lovers <span lang="en-US">Timon</span> drew back from the girl, holding her at arm’s length and he spoke softly. Huy could not catch the words. He heard only the sort rumble of Timon’s voice, and the girl nodded quickly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon left her and disappeared amongst the tents. Sellene went to the grinding stone and filled a leather bag with ground corn, then she glanced about furtively and followed Timon into the darkness. Huy watched her go, and smiled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I must talk to Lannon,’ he thought. ‘I could arrange a pairing between those two.’</p>

  <p class="normal">In his own tent Huy took the golden scroll and spread it upon his writing pallet. He adjusted the lamp wicks, picked up his engraving tool, and began to write the poem to Tanith.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Her hair is dark and soft as the smoke from the papyrus fires upon the great lake,’ he wrote, and the incident between Timon and Sellene was forgotten.</p>

  <p class="normal">Exhaustion overcame him a little after midnight, and he fell forward across his writing pallet and he slept with one cheek pressed to the love poem to Tanith on the golden scroll. The lamp flames smoked and faded and died.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rough hands shook him awake in the dawn, and he looked up groggily. It was Mursil, the huntmaster.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The Gry-Lion sends for you, Holiness. The hounds are in leash, and the slave-masters assembled. Two of the king’s slaves have run, and the king bids you join the chase.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Even in his half-wakening state, Huy knew who the running slaves were, and he felt the sick sliding of his guts.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The fools,’ he whispered. ‘Oh, the stupid fools.’ Then he looked at Mursil. ‘No,’ he said. ‘I cannot - I will not go with him. I am sick, tell him I am sick.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Sellene stood in the shadows and listened to the drunken bellowing and laughter from the king’s tent. Beneath the short cloak was concealed the leather grain-bag, a bundle of smoked meat dried into hard black sticks, and a small earthen cooking pot. There was food for two of them for four days, and by then they would be across the great river. She was fearful, and elated at the same time. They had planned this moment for two years, and many emotions played behind her round impassive face as she waited.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon came at last; quietly he appeared beside her with such suddenness that she gasped with fright. He took her hand, and led her away towards the perimeter of the camp. She saw that he wore a cloak also, and that a bow and quiver stood behind his shoulder and a short iron sword was belted at his waist. These were weapons forbidden to a slave, and death was the penalty for carrying them.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were two guards at the gate of the stockade, and while Sellene spoke with them, offering favours, Timon came from the darkness behind them. He broke their necks with his bare hands, taking one in each hand and shaking them the way a dog will shake a rat. There was no outcry, and Timon laid the bodies gently beside the stockade gate and they went through.</p>

  <p class="normal">They passed through the saucer where the elephant had been butchered, and the night was hideous with the snarling and yammering of the scavengers. Hyena and jackal fought over the bloody scraps and bone chips. With the sword bared in one hand Timon led Sellene through, and though the slinking hump-shouldered hyena followed them, moaning and sniggering, they reached the pass and started down the elephant road into the valley. The moon gave them good light, and they moved fast. They stopped only once at the ford of the stream to rest and drink a little water, then they hurried on towards the north.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once they came upon a lion in the path. A big male whose body was ghostly grey in the moonlight, with a dark ruff of mane. They stared at each other for long seconds before the lion grunted softly and leapt into the undergrowth beside the path. He had fed recently, and the two human shapes did not interest him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The moon, four days past full, wheeled across the star-furry sky and sank towards the dark horizon. When it set, there was only the indistinct glow of the stars to light their way, and at a steep and broken place in the path Sellene fell heavily.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon heard her cry out and he turned back quickly. She was lying on her side, making a soft moaning sound.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you hurt?’ he asked as he dropped to his knees beside her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My ankle.’ she whispered, agony making her voice husky and Timon groped down her leg. Already the ankle was hot to the touch, and as he held it he could feel it swelling, blowing up into a hard hot ball.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the sword Timon cut strips from his cloak, and he bound the ankle tightly as Huy had taught him. He worked with frantic haste, and the worms of dread were already gnawing his guts.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he lifted Sellene to her feet, she cried out as her weight came on the injured foot.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can you walk on it?’ Timon asked, and she tried a few painful hobbling steps. She was panting with pain and her breathing whistled in her throat. She clung to Timon and shook her head hopelessly,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I cannot go on. Leave me here.’ Timon lowered her to the ground, and then straightened up as he discarded his weapons and her provisions. He kept only the short sword. He folded and knotted the two leather cloaks into a sling seat for Sellene, and placed it about her body. Then he looped the end over his neck and shoulder and lifted her. She was in his arms, with her own clasped about his shoulders. Half of her weight was taken by the sling, hanging about Timon’s neck. He started forward, striding out down the steep path towards the valley floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">By mid-morning the sling had rubbed the skin from his neck, a weeping pink graze through the dark skin. The heat was strong now, that heavy oppressive heat of the valley floor sucking away the last of his energy. The spring had long gone from Timon’s step, and he reeled forward with spirit outlasting his physical strength.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the edge of one of the glades of open grass, Timon stopped and leaned against the trunk of a mhoba-hoba tree. He was afraid to lower the girl’s body to the ground lest he could not find the strength to lift it again. His lips were white and rimmed with dried spittle, and his eyes were laced with red veins. His chest heaved and shook with his breathing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Leave me, Timon,’ Sellene whispered, ‘This way both of us will die.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon did not answer, but gestured her to silence with an impatient inclination of his head. He held his breath and listened. She heard it also then, the faint and distant baying of the hound pack.</p>

  <p class="normal">He said, ‘It is too late for that.’ And he looked about quickly tor a place to stand. They could not hope to outrun the dogs.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You can still escape,’ she urged him. ‘The river is not far.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Without you there is no escape,’ he said, and she clung to him as he carried her across the glade to a place where the mother rock outcropped. A jumble of fragmented granite like the ruins of an ancient castle.</p>

  <p class="normal">He laid her gently amongst the rocks, with her back against one of the slabs. He folded her cloak and placed it as a pillow for her head, then he squatted beside her and caressed her face and neck with a surprisingly gentle touch for so big a man.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They will kill us,’ Sellene said. ‘They always kill those who run.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon did not answer, but his fingers stroked her cheek lightly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They kill in the worst way,’ Sellene said, turning her head to look at him. ‘Would it not be better if we died now, before the dogs come?’ But he did not answer, and after a while she went on. ‘You have the sword, Timon. Will you not use it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If the little priest is with them, then we have a chance. He has power over the king - and there is a thing between him and me. There is a bond. He will save us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The dogs were closer now, and it seemed that their baying had become more urgent as the scent ran hotter, Timon stood up and unsheathed the sword. He went out amongst the rocks and looked back towards the escarpment. Half a mile back the pack streamed from the forest into the glade. There were thirty of the tall sinewy hounds, long-legged and with rough ginger-brown coats and the heads and fangs of wolves. They were bred to chase and drag down the quarry.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon felt his skin tighten and prickle as he watched them string out across the glade towards him. Behind them, running on the heels <span lang="en-US">of</span> the pack were the handlers, with their distinctive green tunics and the dog-whips over their shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beyond them again came the war elephants, five of them with the knights and slave-masters in their castles. The elephants followed the pack easily, in that ambling gait which could cover fifty miles in a day.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon shaded his eyes and tried to pick out the distinctive figure of the priest amongst the men in the castles. They were too far off still, but the hounds were closing swiftly.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wrapped his cloak carefully about his left forearm, and settled his grip on the sword, swinging the weapon in a short arc to stretch his muscles.</p>

  <p class="normal">The leading hounds saw him amongst the rocks, and immediately the deep regular baying changed to an excited yammering. Their ears flattened as they ran, and long pink tongues flopped over white fangs in the wolf jaws, and they fanned out across his front.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon stepped back into the opening where Sellene lay, guarding her from the vicious clamouring rush of brown bodies.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first hound rushed in at him, with its jaws snapping, and it leapt at his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon took him on the point, in the base of his throat, killing the dog instantly, but before he could clear his blade another had sprung at him. He thrust his cloaked arm into its jaws, and hacked at a third hound.</p>

  <p class="normal">They swarmed over him as he stabbed and hacked and thrust. He swung the hound that hung on his arm against the rock beside him, crushing in its ribs, but another had locked its fangs in his calf and was tugging him cruelly off balance. He drove the point into its shaggy back and the hound shrieked and released him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Another went for his face and he struck at its head with the sword hilt. A great furry body smashed into his chest, a tang ripped his shoulder muscles.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were too many of them, overwhelming him, ripping and tearing at him, smothering him with their weight and strength. He went down on his knees, holding a frothing slavering animal away from his throat and face with one hand, strangling it, but he felt other teeth slashing at his back and belly and thighs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then abruptly the dog-handlers were there, whipping the pack away from him, shouting to the animals by name, dragging them back and leashing them in the strangling collars.</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly Timon pulled himself up onto his feet. He had lost his sword, and blood streamed down his shining black body from the deep cuts and lacerations that covered him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked up at the war elephant which towered over him. His last hope faded as he saw that Huy Ben-Amon was not amongst the hunters - and that Lannon Hycanus, the Gry-Lion of Opet was laughing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A good run, slave,’ Lannon laughed. ‘I thought that you might reach the river.’ He looked beyond Timon to where Sellene lay. ‘My huntmasters were correct, then. They judged by the sign that the woman had damaged her leg and that you were carrying her. A noble gesture, slave, most unusual for a pagan. All the same it will cost you dear.’ Lannon looked away to one of his slave-masters. ‘There seems little to be gained by returning with them. Execute them here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon looked up at the king and spoke in a strong clear voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am the living symbol of that love,’ he said, and Lannon’s head jerked around as he remembered the words. With the laughter gone from his lips he stared at the bleeding slave king, meeting those smoky yellow eyes. For long seconds, Timon’s life teetered on the verge of extinction, then suddenly Lannon’s eyes dropped away from those of Timon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Very well,’ he nodded. ‘You remind me of my duty to a friend. I will honour it, but I swear you will live to curse the moment you spoke those words. You will live - but in life you will long for the sweetness of death.’ Lannon’s face was a mask of cold anger, as he turned back to his slave-masters. ‘This man will not be executed, but he is declared “incorrigible” and he will be chained with a weight of two talents.’ Almost a hundred pounds’ weight of chains to be carried night and day, waking and sleeping. ‘Send him to the mines at Hulya, tell the overseer there that he is to be used at the deep levels.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon watched Timon’s face as he went on. ‘The woman cannot <span lang="en-US">claim</span> my protection, but we will take her back with us, none the less. Let her be chained to the castle of one of the war elephants and marched.’</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first time Timon showed emotion. He stepped forward and in appeal lifted one badly savaged arm from which the dark tattered flesh hung.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, the woman is hurt. She cannot walk.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She will walk,’ said Lannon. ‘Or she will be dragged. You will ride upon the elephant and encourage her. You will have time to decide if the swift death I offered you would not have been preferable to the life you have chosen.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They chained Sellene at the wrists with a light marching chain twenty paces long. The other end of the chain was shackled to the rear wall of the elephant castle.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timon, wearing his massive chains at neck and ankles, was seated in the castle. He was made to face backwards to where Sellene stood swaying slightly on one leg, favouring her grotesquely swollen ankle. Her face was greyish with pain, but she tried to smile up at Timon.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first jerk of the chain as the elephant started forward pulled her face downwards on the hard earth, with its sharp shales and harsh clumps of razor grass. She was dragged fifty paces before she managed to roll onto her feet again and hop and stumble after the striding elephant. Her knees and elbows were raw, and there were scratches across her belly and breasts.</p>

  <p class="normal">She fell and regained her feet a dozen times, each time her body was more battered and torn. She went down for the last time a little before sunset.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Timon sat in the castle, draped in his chains, he swore an oath. In his anger and grief and pain he swore an oath of vengeance, watching Sellene’s lifeless body bounce and slide over the rough places, leaving a damp brown smear across the dry red African earth. Then Timon wept, for the last time in his life he succumbed to tears. They ran down his face and dripped from his chin to mingle with the blood and dust that caked his body.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Huy filled a wine bowl from one of his choice amphorae, one that he had set aside for a rare occasion. He was humming softly to himself, and there was a small smile which came and went upon his lips and made his dark eyes sparkle.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had returned to Opet in the middle of the night, slept five hours and now, bathed and dressed in his best linen, he had sent a slave to summon the oracle of Opet to meet with him. All the blood and passion of these last weeks upon the escarpment of the great river were forgotten now in his anticipation of his reunion with Tanith. Forgotten were the memories of Sellene’s mutilated corpse dragged into camp behind the war elephant, the tall figure of Timon bowed beneath his chains and grief, led away by the slave-masters, those terrible accusing eyes turned towards Huy, the manacled wrists lifted in a gesture of menace or of appeal - Huy could not guess which. Then the slave-master’s whip hissing and snapping across the purple black shoulders, lifting a welt as thick as a finger without cutting the skin. For the first time since it had happened Huy was free of it, his whole being taken up with the joy of his love.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pursing his lips thoughtfully he let four drops of the clear liquid drop from the blue glass vial into the wine. He stoppered the bottle and stirred the wine with his forefinger, sucking his finger thoughtfully and wrinkling his nose at the faint musty taste of the opiate. He added a little wild honey to mask it, tasted again and at last satisfied he set the bowl on one of the wooden stools beside the pile of cushions. There was a dish of cakes and sweetmeats there already. Huy covered the wine bowl with a silken cloth, then surveyed his preparations with pleasure. He picked up his lute, and climbed the staircase to the parapet of the roof and seated himself. He tuned the instrument and strummed upon it, loosening his voice and fingers, watching the narrow lane that led up to the front gate.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the bright morning sunlight the lake waters were a cheery blue, only slightly darker than the sky The breeze had flecked the surface with little floppy waves, and one of Hab-bakuk Lal’s galleys had shipped her oars and was running in towards the harbour under a big lateen sail. The sea birds followed her, planing and soaring across her stern.</p>

  <p class="normal">High above the lake the midday clouds were building tall, frothy thunder-heads. There would be rain before sunset, Huy thought, feeling the thunder in the air, in the touch of his garments upon his skin and the curl of his beard.</p>

  <p class="normal">His breath caught, and the music died under his fingers as two figures turned into the lane and came up towards the gate. They wore the coarse brown-hooded robes that the priestesses of Astarte affected while travelling abroad. However, the bulky garments could not disguise the quick step and youthful carriage of the taller figure that hurried ahead, nor the age and aggravation of the bent figure that hobbled after her. The ancient voice, breathless and high, called with exasperation.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lady, slower! I pray you.’ And Huy grinned. A slave opened the gate, and as they crossed the courtyard Huy struck a single authoritative note on the lute, and Tanith stopped dead. The old chaperone, unhearing, moved on into the house mumbling and muttering while Tanith looked up at Huy upon the parapet of the roof.</p>

  <p class="normal">He began to sing, and the girl below him lifted the hood from her face and let it fall back on her shoulders. She shook her hair loose, watching his face with large green eyes and her expression was rapt and solemn. He sang the song he had written in the wilderness, the song to Tanith inscribed in the golden book, and as he let the last sweet note fall on the bright morning, Tanith’s cheeks were flushed and her lips trembled.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy went down the staircase and stood close to her, without touching her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are my soul,’ he said gently, and she swayed towards him as if drawn by a force beyond her control.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, I cannot trust myself to be with you where other eyes may see us. I fear I shall betray my love to the blindest of them. Be strong for me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy touched her elbow, guiding her towards the house. As they passed through into the main room, Tanith stumbled slightly, for a moment pressed against him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh! I cannot bear it,’ she said, and Huy’s voice shook as he answered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In a while, my love, In a very short while.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The old priestess was seated on the cushions already, mouthing a cake with bald gums, dropping crumbs and spittle down her robe and mumbling bitterly about her pains and aches.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy moved around behind her, and picked up the prepared wine bowl in both hands. Secure in the old priestess’s deafness he asked Tanith, ‘Is she strong?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As strong as most men,’ Tanith smiled. ‘Though she’ll not admit it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She does not complain of chest pains or shortness of breath?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Never.’ Tanith was intrigued. ‘Why do you ask?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have placed star-drops in her wine,’ Huy explained. ‘But I do not want her sleep to be eternal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith’s smile flamed, lighting the green depths of her eyes and sparkling on her teeth. ‘Oh, Holy Father, how clever of you.’ She clapped her hands, a childlike gesture that never failed to touch Huy to the core of his being.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How many drops?’ Tanith demanded</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Four,’ Huy admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Perhaps a few more would not hurt her,’ Tanith said. ‘I have not seen you in many weeks, Holiness. There is much to discuss.’</p>

  <p class="normal">During this exchange the old priestess had been nodding and grimacing intelligently, quite as though she had understood every word. Huy studied her a moment, then firmly thrust aside the temptation.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ he said. ‘Four is sufficient.’ And he came around in front of the priestess. The wrinkled monkey-like face split into a huge toothless grin and she reached for the bowl with a pair of bony claws, on which the old-age blotches and blue veins stood out clearly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You have a kind heart. Holiness,’ she keened.</p>

  <p class="normal">They seated themselves in front of her, and while they talked they watched her anxiously. The crone was drawing out her pleasure, sipping the wine and rolling it noisily around her mouth before swallowing and smacking her gums.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Since we have been apart, I have thought much upon what has happened between us,’ Huy admitted, without looking at Tanith.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have thought of nothing else.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As a man whose life is devoted to the service of the gods, I was greatly troubled that we had sinned against them,’ Huy told her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There can be no sin in something which gives so much pleasure and happiness.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I asked the gods to set a test for me, a trial of my sins.’ Huy had still not looked at her, but Tanith glanced at him sharply and her voice snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You did not indulge in foolish risk, did you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The trial was a fair one - the gods were not cheated.’ Huy wanted her to understand, and she understood too well.</p>
