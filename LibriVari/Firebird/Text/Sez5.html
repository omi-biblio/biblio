  <p class="normal">They were filled with semi-precious stones, amethyst, beryl, tigers’ eyes, jade and malachite. Some of these were crudely cut and incorporated in gold jewellery, thick clumsy pieces, collars, brooches, necklaces and rings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren hurried on down the aisle, and then stopped abruptly. In another recess that led off the main chamber, behind another iron gate, the gold was stacked in neat piles. Cast in the usual ‘finger’ moulds. The piles of precious metal were insignificant in bulk, but when, months later, it was all weighed the total was over sixty tons.</p>

  <p class="normal">Its value was in excess of £60,000,000 sterling. In the same recess as the gold were two small wooden chests. These yielded 26,000 carats of uncut and rough-cut diamonds of every conceivable colour and shape. Not one of these was smaller than one and a half carats, and the largest was a big sulky yellow monster of thirty-eight carats, and this added a further £2,000,000 to the intrinsic value of the treasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">Here was the wealth of forty-seven kings of Opet, accumulated painstakingly over the course of 400 years. No other treasure of antiquity could compare with this profusion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’ll have to be bloody careful, Ben. No word of this must leak out. You understand what might happen if it did?’ He stood with a finger of solid gold in each hand, looking down on the piles of treasure. ‘This is enough to kill for, to start a war!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you want me to do, Lo? I must have help in here. Ral or Sally even.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No!’ He turned on me ferociously. ‘No one else will be allowed in here. I will leave orders with the guards, no one but you and I.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I need help, Lo. I can’t do it myself, there is too much here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll help you,’ Louren said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It will take weeks.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll help you,’ he repeated. ‘No one else. Not a word to anyone else.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Until six o’clock that evening Louren and I explored the treasure vault.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s find out where the other branch of the tunnel leads to,’ I suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ Louren stopped me. ‘I want to keep normal hours here. I don’t want the others to guess that we are up to something. We will go down to the camp now. Tomorrow we will have a look at the other fork of the tunnel. It can’t be anything like this anyway.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We closed the stone door behind us, sealing off the secret passage, and at the guard post Louren made his orders clear, repeating them and writing them on the guard’s instruction sheet. Ral’s and Sally’s names were removed from the list of those allowed into the tunnel. And later he mentioned it to them at dinner. He explained it away as an experiment that he and I were attempting. It was a difficult evening for me. I was overwrought by the day’s excitement, and now that I had shaken off my mood of apathy I was over-reacting to the normal stimuli of living. I found myself laughing too loudly, drinking too much, and the agony of my jealousy returned more intensely than ever.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Louren and Sally looked at each other like that, I wanted to shout at them, ‘I know. I know about it, and damn you, I hate you for it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">But then I knew it was not true. I did not hate them. I loved them both and this made it all the harder to bear.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no chance of sleep for me that night. When I get myself into a certain state of nervous tension, then I can go for two or three nights without being able to still the racing of my overheated brain. I did not mean to spy on her. It was a mere coincidence that I was standing at the window of my hut staring cut from my darkened room at the moonlit night when Sally left her own hut.</p>

  <p class="normal">She wore a long pale-coloured dressing-gown and her hair was let down in a dark cloud around her shoulders. She paused in the doorway of her own hut and looked around carefully, making sure that the camp was asleep. Then guiltily, quickly, she hurried across the open moonlit yard to the hut in which Louren was living. She opened the door and went in without hesitating and for me a long harrowing vigil had begun.</p>

  <p class="normal">I stood by my window for two hours, watching the moon shadows change shape, watching the patterns of the stars swing and turn across the heavens, stars as fat and bright as they are only in the sweet clean air of the wilderness. The beauty of it was wasted on me this night. I was watching Louren’s hut, imagining each whispered word, each touch, each movement, and hating myself and them. I thought of Hilary and the children, wondering what madness it is that makes a man gamble his all on a few hours of transient pleasure. In that darkened hut how many confidences were those two betraying, how many people’s happiness were they risking.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then suddenly I realized that I was assuming that this affair was merely play on Louren’s part, and I faced the possibility that he was serious. That he would desert Hilary and go to Sally. I found this thought intolerable. I could no longer watch and wait, I must have some distraction and I dressed quickly and hurried across to the repository.</p>

  <p class="normal">The night-watchman greeted me sleepily, and I unlocked the door and went to the vault in which the golden books were kept, I took out the fourth book of Huy. I carried it across to my own office, and before I settled down to read I went to fetch a bottle of Glen Grant. My two opiates, words and whisky.</p>

  <p class="normal">I opened the scroll at random and re-read Huy’s ode to his battle-axe, the gleaming wing of the bird of the sun. When I had finished I was taken by an impulse and I lifted the great axe down from its place of honour. I caressed the shimmering length of it, studying it with new attention. I was convinced that this was the weapon of the poem. Could there be another answering the description so accurately? I held it in my lap, wishing that I could draw from it the story of the last days of Opet. I was sure it was involved intimately in the final tragedy. Why had it been left abandoned, a thing so well beloved and yet thrown carelessly aside to lie uncared for and discarded for nearly 2,000 years? What had happened to the Axeman Huy, and his king and his city?</p>

  <p class="normal">I read and dreamed, disturbed less frequently by thoughts of Sally and Louren. However, at every pause in my readings they came to me with a sick little slide of jealousy and despair in my guts. I was torn between the present and the distant past.</p>

  <p class="normal">I read on, sampling those portions of the scroll which were still unknown territory while the level in the whisky bottle sank slowly and the long night passed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then when midnight had flown and the new day was being born, I came upon a small piece of writing which touched a new depth of response in me. Huy makes a sudden heart-felt cry from the depths of his being. It is as though some long-suppressed emotion will no longer be contained and must come out in this appeal to have his physical form discounted when his value is assessed. From base earth flowers the purest gold, Huy cries, in his own poor distorted clay there were treasures concealed.</p>

  <p class="normal">I re-read the passage half a dozen times, making sure of my translation before I could accept that Huy Ben-Amon was like me. <em>A cripple.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><a id="dd"></a><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Dawn’s first promise was tracing the silhouette of the cliff tops with a pale rose colour when I laid the golden book away in its vault and walked slowly back towards my hut.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally stepped out of Louren’s doorway and came towards me in the darkness. Her gown was ghostly pale and she seemed to float above the ground. I stood still, hoping she would not see me. There was a chance, for I stood in the deeper shadow of her hut and I turned my face away, standing quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">I heard the rustle of her skirts, the whisper of her feet in the dust very close in the dark, then her startled gasp as she saw me. I looked at her then. She had seen but not recognized me. Her face was a pale moon of fear and her hands were at her mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All right, Sally,’ I said. ‘It’s only me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I could smell her now. On the clean night air of the desert it was a perfumed smell like crushed rose petals, and mingled with it the warm smell of perspiration and lovet. My heart slid in my chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben?’ she said, and we were both silent, staring at each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How long have you been here?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Long enough,’ I answered, and again the silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know, then?’ It was said in a small voice, shy and sad.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I didn’t mean to spy,’ I said, and another silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I believe you.’ She began to move away. Then she turned back. ‘Ben, I want to explain.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You don’t have to do that,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, I do. I want to.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It doesn’t matter, Sal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It does matter.’ And we faced each other. ‘It does matter,’ she repeated. ‘I don’t want you to think that I, well, that I am so terrible.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Forget it, Sally.’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I tried not to, Ben. I swear to you.’‘</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s all right, Sally.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I couldn’t help it, truly. I tried so hard to fight it. I didn’t want it to happen.’ She was crying now, silently, her shoulders shaking as she sobbed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It doesn’t matter,’ I said, and went to her. I took her gently to her room and put her on the bed. In the light I saw how her lips were swollen and kiss-inflamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Ben, I would have given anything for it to be different.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know, Sally.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I tried so hard, but it was too much for me. He had me in some kind of spell, from the very first moment I saw him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That evening at the airport?’ I could not help but ask the question, remembering how she had watched Louren that first time she met him and how later she had ranted against him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s why - later, with me - that’s why we—’ I did not want to hear her answer, and yet I must know if she had first come to me inflamed with thoughts of another man.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Ben.’ She tried to deny it, but she saw my eyes, and turned her face away. ‘Oh, Ben, I’m sorry. I didn’t want to hurt you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ I nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I truly didn’t want to hurt you. You are so good, so gentle, so different from him.’ There were dark shadows of sleeplessness beneath her eyes, and the peach-coloured velvet of her cheeks was rubbed pink by Louren’s unshaven skin.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ I said with my heart breaking.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Ben, what shall I do?’ she cried in distress. ‘I am caught in this thing. I cannot escape.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Does Lo - has he said what he is going to do? Has he, told you he, well, that he will leave Hilary, and marry you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’ She shook her head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Has he given you reason—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No! No!’ She caught my hand. ‘Oh, Ben. It’s just fun for him. It’s just a little adventure.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I said nothing, watching her lovely tortured face, glad at least that she knew about Louren. Realized that he was a hunter and she the quarry. There had been many Sallys in Louren’s life, and there would be many more. The lion must kill regularly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is there anything I can do, Sally?’ I asked at last.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Ben. I don’t think so.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If there is, tell me,’ I said and moved towards the door.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben,’ she stopped me, and sat up, ‘Ben, do you still love me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I nodded without hesitation. ‘Yes, <em>I</em> still love you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank you, Ben,’ she sighed softly. ‘I don’t think I could have taken it if you had turned away from me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll never do that, Sally,’ I said, and walked out into the lemon and rose glow of dawn.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Louren and I descended the staircase beyond the sun image. We went first to the treasure vault. While Louren gloated over the stacks of golden fingers, I watched his face. I was lightheaded from lack of sleep, and I could taste the spirits I had drunk in the back of my throat. Watching Louren, I tried to find hatred for him in my heart, I searched diligently without success. When he looked up and smiled at me, I could not but answer him with a smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This will keep, Ben,’ he said, ‘Let’s go and have a look at the rest of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">I had guessed what we would find beyond the junction of the tunnels, and once we had descended the last spiralling stairs and come into another short level passage I had my last doubts dispelled.</p>

  <p class="normal">The passage ended against another solid stone wall. Here, however, there was no attempt at concealment, for carved into the stone was an inscription. We stood before it, and Louren held the arc-lamp full upon it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What does it say?’ he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">I read it through slowly. Even with all my practice I read slowly, for in Punic there are no symbols for the vowels and each must be guessed from the context of the word.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on,’ Louren muttered impatiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘“You who come here to interrupt the sleep of the kings of Opet, and to despoil <span lang="en-US">their</span> tomb, do so at your peril, and may the curse of Astarte and great Baal hound you to your own graves.”’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Read it again,’ Louren commanded, and I did. He nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ he said, and stepped to the stone door. He began to seek the pivot point which we knew would trigger the mechanism. Here we were not so fortunate as we had been at the threshold of the sun door. After two hours, our way was still barred by that solid slab of uncompromising stone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m going to blow the bloody thing open,’ Louren warned, but I knew he would not commit such an atrocity in this sacred place. We rested and discussed the problem, before returning to the door. It had to be another simple leverage system, but the trick was to find the pressure point and the angle of movement.</p>

  <p class="normal">When we found it at last, I cursed my own stupidity. It should have been my first attempt. The symbol for the name of the sun-god Baal was once more the pressure point.</p>

  <p class="normal">The door swung open, ponderous and slow, and we went through into the tomb of the kings of Opet.</p>

  <p class="normal">There is only one other place I have known with the same atmosphere. That is Westminster Abbey which contains the tombs of so many of the kings of England. There was the same hushed cathedral sense of time past and history reborn.</p>

  <p class="normal">Neither of us spoke as we went to the centre of the long narrow vaulted tomb. The silence was an oppressive weight upon my ear drums. Utter silence, so complete as to be sinister and threatening. Here again the air was long disused, but with an even heavier musty quality to it. I thought I detected the faint, stale smell of dust and mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="normal">Along each wall, parallel to it, stood the sarcophagi of the kings of Opet. They were carved of massive granite. Solid, squat and grey. The lids were held in place by their own immense weight, and the upper surface had been polished and engraved with the name and style of the body that lay within. The mighty names that had echoed through the golden books of Huy. I recognized them, Hamilcar, Hannibal, Hycanus. Forty-seven great coffins, but the last was empty, its lid propped against the wall beside it. Its interior cut-out into a man’s shape, ready to swallow the last king of Opet.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the foot of the great stone coffin a man lay stretched upon his back on the floor of the tomb. His helmet was missing and his red-gold hair and beard formed a soft frame for the wizened mummified features. His breastplate had been removed exposing the dried parchment skin stretched over the gaunt skeletal rib-cage. The broken shaft of an arrow protruded from a long-dead chest. He wore a kilt of leather, studded with bronze rosettes and on his shins were greaves of bronze, on his feet light sandals.</p>

  <p class="normal">His arms lay at his side, his heels were together. The dead body had been laid out with care and obvious love.</p>

  <p class="normal">Over him stooped another figure, kneeling like a man in prayer. A figure in full armour, with only the war helmet and breastplate discarded on the floor beneath the empty sarcophagus. Long black hair hung forward to conceal his bowed face. Both hands clutched at his chest at the level of the diaphragm. From his chest a blade of steel protruded, a reversed sword, with its hilt securely anchored against the stone slabs of the floor, the point driven up under the ribs and lodged in his vitals.</p>

  <p class="normal">Here was a man in the attitude of final escape from the shame of defeat, a man who in despair had fallen upon his own sword. The weapon had supported his weight these many centuries, propping him up in that kneeling position.</p>

  <p class="normal">Neither Louren nor I could speak, as we drew closer to this tableau of ancient tragedy. For me there was no doubt as to the identity of these dried-out human husks.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon Hycanus, the last King of Opet, lay stretched on the cold stone floor. Above him knelt his friend and high priest Huy Ben-Amon.</p>

  <p class="normal">I felt choked with a sense of destiny, with a cold aching dread - for Huy Ben-Amon, the Axeman of the Gods, was a <em>hunchback</em>.</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>I</em> had to see his face. I had to see it! I ran forward, and knelt beside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">I touched his gaunt bony shoulder, covered by a tunic of brittle yellow linen. It was the lightest touch, a breath almost, but it was enough to shatter that delicately poised mummy.</p>

  <p class="normal">The corpse of Huy Ben-Amon slid forward and crashed down on the body of the king. Steel and bronze rang on the stone floor, and echoed about the vaulted tomb of Opet.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two figures burst into dust at the impact, a soft yellow explosion of mustard-yellow dust, swirling like smoke in the arc-light. There was nothing left of them but the metal of armour and sword, and two hanks of gold and sable hair in the puddle of talcum-soft dust.</p>

  <p class="normal">I stood up, choking with the yellow dust. My eyes were swimming with tears of wonder and burning with the dust. The dust smelled of mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren Sturvesant and I stared at each other without speaking. We had witnessed a miracle.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">I awoke from a screaming nightmare of blood and flame and smoke, a horror of shining black <span lang="en-US">faces</span> and sweat-polished bodies lit by crackling roaring flames and the scream of the dying and the animal roar of blood-crazed voices. I woke panting and choking from the memory, and the terror and horror of it stayed with me long after I had found myself alone in my quiet hut in the silent night.</p>

  <p class="normal">I switched on the bedside light and looked at my watch. It was still early, a little before eleven. I threw back my sheets and stood up, surprised to find my legs shaky and my breathing ragged. There was a twinge of pain at each breath I drew, and a dull tight sensation behind my eyes. My body felt hot, fever hot. I went to the washstand across the hut, and shook three aspirin from the bottle. I swallowed them with a mouthful of water, and then the tickling sensation in my lungs grew stronger. I coughed as though I was on sixty cigarettes a day, and the effort left me sweaty and trembling. My skin seemed to be aflame.</p>

  <p class="normal">Without really knowing why, I took my dressing-gown off the hook behind the door, pulled it on and went out into the yard. There was half a moon in the sky, horned and yellow. The shadows under the trees and around the buildings were very dark and ugly. I felt the lingering dread and horror of my nightmare still upon me as I hurried across towards my office, and I glanced about me nervously. I could smell the tinge of smoke on the night air, and it troubled me also. I sniffed at it, feeling the faint sting deep in my lungs.</p>

  <p class="normal">I reached the door of my office, and there was something waiting for me in the deep shadow beside the building. I saw it rush at me from the corner of my vision, a big dark thing, rounded and shapeless and deadly silent. I spun to face it, falling against the wall of the hut, weak with terror. A scream bubbled and died in my throat for there was nothing there. It was gone, I had imagined it, but now the pain in my head beat like hammer blows on the anvil.</p>

  <p class="normal">I pulled the door open, and fell into my office, slammed the door behind me, locked it, gasping with unnamed and baseless fear. Something scratched against the door from the outside, a terrifying clawing animal sound that ripped my quivering nerves.</p>

  <p class="normal">I backed away from the door towards my desk, crouching there, trembling, shaking and weak.</p>

  <p class="normal">The sound came again, but from the wall beside me, I spun to face it, and heard myself whimper.</p>

  <p class="normal">I needed a weapon, I looked around desperately and the great battle-axe of Huy hung on the wall above my desk. I snatched it down and backed into a corner, holding it ready, at the present position across my chest. I coughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a thick sheaf of white paper on my desk. It moved and I felt the gooseflesh crawl all over my hot body. The white square of paper quivered and wavered, it changed shape, crawled across my desk, and spread white bats’ wings. Then suddenly it launched into flight, wings whispering, and it flew at my face. I saw the wide open mouth ringed with needle vampire teeth, heard the shrill squeaks as it attacked. I shouted with horror, and struck with the axe. The white thing fluttered and squeaked against my throat and face, and I fought and shouted, striking it down onto the floor where, it crawled and slithered loathsomely. I struck with the edge of the axe, and inky black blood spurted from the thing and puddled the wooden floor of the hut.</p>

  <p class="normal">I backed away from the thing, and lay back against the wall. I felt weak, and terribly afraid. I began to cough. The cough took hold of my whole body and shook it, rocking me, doubling me against the wall. I coughed until my vision burst into bright lights, and there was a salty sweet taste in my mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">I sank to my knees against the wall, my mouth was filled with warm wetness and I spat a thick gob of bright blood onto the floor. I stared at it, not understanding what was happening to me. I <span lang="en-US">lifted</span> my hand to my mouth and wiped my lips. My hand came away smeared with blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">I knew then what it was. Louren and I had passed beyond two sealed doorways into the depths of a tomb closed for 2,000 years - and we had breathed air loaded with the spores of <em>cryptococcus neuromyces</em>, the curse of the Pharaohs.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was too late now for me to berate myself for overlooking the precautions. I had believed that because the archives were safe, the rest of it was also. In my eagerness and excitement I had not given another thought to the fungus danger, even when Louren and I had discussed the door seals and even when I had smelled the mushroom odour in the tomb of the kings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now my lungs were clogged with the horrible colonies of living fungus, a growing living thing within me, feeding on the soft tissues of my body, and pouring out its poisons into my blood to be carried to my brain.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Treatment,’ I gasped, ‘got to find the treatment.’ And I staggered across to my bookshelves. I tried to read the letters on the spines of the books, but they changed to little black insects and crawled away. Suddenly a thick mottled snake uncoiled from the top shelf, and dangled down towards my face, a thick bloated puff-adder with a flicking black tongue. I backed away, then turned and fled out into the night.</p>

  <p class="normal">The smoke was thick, swirling around me, choking me so that I coughed wildly. The flames around me lit all with a lurid satanic glow, a flickering glow. There were dark shapes and strange sounds. I saw Louren’s hut, and ran towards it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren,’ I screamed, bursting in through the door. ‘Louren!’ panting, coughing.</p>

  <p class="normal">The light went on. Sally was alone in Louren’s bed, she sat up, sleepy, soft-eyed, naked, and looked at me with unfocused vision.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where is he?’ I shouted at her. She looked confused, not understanding.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben, what is it? You’re bleeding!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where is Lo?’ It was desperately urgent. I had to find him. He had been exposed to the fungus also. I had to find him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally looked down at the bed beside her. There was the indentation on the pillow where Louren’s head had lain.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know,’ she said, big-eyed, puzzled. ‘He was here. He must have gone out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I coughed, great choking sobs, and felt fresh blood in my mouth. Sally was fully awake now. She stared at me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben, what is it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Neuromyces,’ I told her, and she gasped seeing the blood streaming down my chin.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren and I have opened a secret passage beyond the sun image in the archives. It’s infected with the spores. We took no precautions. It has got us. I’m sure he’s there now. I’m going to him.’ I stopped to breathe. Sally was out of bed slipping into her gown, coming to me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get Ral Davidson. Respirators. Take all precautions. Follow us. I will prop the doors open. Down steps. Turn left at bottom. Follow us. Louren will have it also, drives you mad. Crazy. Terrible things. Come quickly - do you understand?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, Ben.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get Ral,’ I said and turned. I ran out into the smoke and flames and darkness, running for the cliffs and the cavern. The great walls of the temple towered above me, walls long gone. The great phallic towers of Baal pointed to the moon, lit by the flames of a burning city. Towers that stood again after so long. They were screaming, the women, burning alive with their children. Dead men lay strewn in my path, cut down like the harvest of the devil, their dead faces terrible in the moonlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren,’ I shouted and ran on through the temple. They were in my path, dark and savage, crowding forward to oppose me. Dark, shapeless, terrifying, and I flew at them with a strange battle cry yelled from a blood-glutted throat. The mighty axe spun its silver circles in the firelight, and I was through them, running.</p>

  <p class="normal">I reached the cavern, saw it lit by the guttering torches, saw the pavement of stone bordering the circular green beauty of the emerald pool. The rows of stone benches, rising in tiers around it as they had 2,000 years before. With a last enormous effort of will, I forced my brain to discount this fantasy and to recognize reality.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wooden guard hut stood across the cavern from me. I staggered towards it. The guard sat at his desk reading. He looked up, his expression changing to surprise and incredulity.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good God, are you all right, Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mr Sturvesant, is he in the tunnel?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When did he go in?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘An hour ago.’ The guard came towards me. ‘Is something wrong? You are bleeding, Doctor!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wait here,’ I told him. ‘The others are coming. They know what do to.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I hurried on into the archives, smelling the smoke still and hearing the clamour <em>of</em> a dying city ring in my ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">Before the image of the sun-god I let the great battle-axe slip from my hand and left it lying on the stone floor. I pushed the stone door open, and propped it with one of the war shields to prevent it swinging closed behind me.</p>

  <p class="normal">I ran down the staircase. Halfway down I saw the glow of light from the tomb below.</p>

  <p class="normal">The inscribed doorway with its graven curse of the gods stood open, jammed in the hinge by the cable of the arc-light. The light lay on its side in the centre of the tomb where Louren had dropped it. The bulb still burned, lighting the tomb vividly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren lay on his back at the foot of the huge granite sarcophagus of Lannon Hycanus, the last king of Opet.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was naked to the waist. His face was deathly pale, his eyes closed, and bright blood stained the corners of his mouth and ran back down his cheeks into his ears and hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the last of my strength I staggered to where he lay and dropped onto my knees beside him. I stooped over him and tried to lift him, my arms around his shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">His skin was moist and burning hot, and his head flopped helplessly backwards. A new bright gush of blood ran out of his mouth, wetting my hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren,’ I cried, holding him to my chest. ‘Oh please, God, help me! Help me!’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was still life in him, just the last flicker of it. He opened his eyes, those pale blue eyes with the first shadows of death darkening them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben,’ he whispered, choking with his own blood. He coughed, spattering droplets of the bright lung blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben,’ he whispered so softly I could scarcely hear it. ‘All the way?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the way, Lo.’ I whispered, holding him like a sleepy child. His head of golden curls cradled against my shoulder. He was quiet for a little while, then suddenly he stirred again, and when he spoke it was in a clear strong voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fly!’ he said. ‘Fly for me, bird of the sun.’ And the life went out of him, he turned to nothing in my arms, the great wild spirit flown - gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">I knelt over him, feeling my own senses reel. The world turned and swung beneath me. I slipped over the edge of it, down into the swirling darkness of time. Down into a kind of death, a kind of life, for in my dying I dreamed a dream. In my poisoned sleep of death which lasted a moment and a million years I dreamed of long-dead men in a time long passed…</p>

  <h1 id="sigil_toc_id_3">Part II</h1>

  <p class="normal">Of the thirty days of the prophecy there were but two remaining when Lannon Hycanus and his train came at last to the Bay of the Little Fish on the farthest southerly shores of the great lake. It was already dark when ten ships of the fleet anchored in the shallow waters of the bay, and their torches and lamps smeared long ruddy paths of light across the black waters.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon stood beside the wooden gunwale of his steering-deck, and looked out across the fields of papyrus and hidden waterways to the south where the open country began and spread away endlessly into the unknown. He knew that here lay his destiny and that of the nation. For twenty-eight days he had hunted and now he felt an unaccustomed chill of fear fan his arms and neck, fear not of the terrible animal he had come to find, but of the consequences of the animal continuing to evade him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Behind him there were light footsteps on the wooden deck and Lannon turned quickly. His hand on the hilt of the dagger beneath his leather cloak relaxed as he saw the unmistakable shape of the man in the light of the torches.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Huy,’ he greeted him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Highness, you must eat now and sleep.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have they come yet?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not yet, but they will before morning,’ replied the hunchback, moving closer to his prince. ‘Come now. You will have need of a steady hand and clear eye on the morrow.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sometimes it seems I have ten wives, not nine,’ laughed Lannon, and regretted the jest when he saw the blood darken the face of the hunchback; quickly he went on. ‘You pamper me, old friend, but I think that tonight I will hunt sleep with as little success as I have hunted the gry-lion these twenty-eight days since my father’s funeral.’ He turned back to the bridge tail and looked across at the other nine ships. The ships of the nine families, come to watch him make good his claim to the throne of Opet and the four kingdoms, come to watch him take his gry-lion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look at them, Huy.’ And his friend came to his side. ‘How many of them have made sacrifices to the gods for my failure?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Three of them, certainly - you know which I mean. There are perhaps more of them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And those who are loyal to house Barca, those we can count upon without question?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know them also, my lord. Habbakuk Lal will stand with you until the seas turn to sand, house Amon, house Hasmon—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ Lannon interrupted. ‘I know them, Huy, every one of them, for and against. I was but talking to have the comfort of your voice.’ He touched the hunchback’s shoulder in a gesture of affection, before turning away to gaze once more into the southern wilderness.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When the prophecy was made did they ever foresee the day when the great gry-lion would pass from the land? When a prince might search for all thirty of the days allotted to the task without seeing even the marks of the beasts’ paws in the earth of Opet?’ Lannon spoke with sudden anger. He flung his cloak back over his shoulder and folded his arms across his naked chest. His skin was freshly oiled and the muscles glowed in the torch light, he kneaded his own flesh with the long powerful fingers.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My father killed on the twenty-fifth day, and that was forty-six years ago. They said even then that the gry-lion was finished. Since then how many have the scouts reported?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My Lord, the gods will decide,’ Huy tried to soothe him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have hunted every covert where the gry-lion has been seen in the last 200 years. Five full legions have swept the swamps in the north, three more along the great river.’ He broke off and began pacing the deck, pausing to look down into the hull where the tiers of naked slaves slept chained upon their benches, leaning on the mighty oars in the position in which they would die. The stench of the rowing decks came up to him as a solid thing in the humid night. He turned back to Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This reach of the swamps is the last place in the whole of my kingdoms which might hide a gry-lion. If it does not, then what will happen, Huy? Is there no other way in which I might prove my right? Is there no escape in the scrolls?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘None, my lord.’ Huy shook his head with regret.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The kingship must fall?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Unless there is a gry-lion taken then Opet will have no king.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who will rule without a king?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The Council of Nine, alone.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the royal house? What will become of house Barca?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let us not talk of it,’ Huy suggested softly. ‘Come, my lord. A slave is preparing a jug of hot spiced wine and a stew of fish. The wine will help you to sleep.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Will you make an oracle for tomorrow, my priest of Baal?’ Lannon asked suddenly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If the oracle is unfavourable, will it help you sleep?’ asked Huy, and Lannon stared at him a moment before barking with harsh laughter.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are right, as always. Come then, I am hungry.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon ate with vast appetite from the bowl of fish, sitting naked on his fur-covered bed. He had let his hair loose and it hung to his shoulders, curling and gleaming strangely golden in the light of the hanging lamp. He was a god-like figure among his dark-haired people.</p>

  <p class="normal">The leather awnings were opened, and a light breeze came tip from the south-east to cool the cabin and blow out the galley stench. The ship moved to the breeze and the light chop of the surface, her timber popped and creaked softly, a slave cried out in nightmare, and from the deck above came the steps of the night guard - all the familiar comforting sounds of the flagship at sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon wiped out the bowl with a piece of millet bread, popped it into his mouth, and washed it down with the last of the wine. He sighed with content, and smiled at Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sing for me, my bird of the sun.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy Ben-Amon squatted on the deck at the foot of the prince’s bed. He held his lute in his lap, and crouched over it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The curve of his back exaggerated the attitude, the long tar-black tresses of hair hung forward to hide his face, his massively developed arms seemed too powerful for the long delicate fingers that held the lute. He struck a note, and a listening hush fell upon the night. The footsteps overhead ceased, two slave girls ceased their work and came to kneel beside Lannon’s bed, the arguing voices from the ship anchored alongside quieted, and Huy sang.</p>

  <p class="normal">His voice rang sweetly across the dark waters, and the prince and the fleet listened. Dark shapes moved to the rails; of the nearest ships and stood quietly there looking across at the flagship. On the cheeks of one of the pretty slave girls stood tear-drops that glistened in the lamp light, when Huy sang of a lost love. Then she smiled through her tears when Huy changed the song to one of the bawdy marching tunes of the Sixth Legion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Enough. Huy looked up from his lute at last, ’There will be work tomorrow, my lord.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon nodded and touched one of the slave girls on the cheek. Immediately she stood up and loosed the shoulder strap of her linen tunic, letting it fall from her body. She was young and lithe, her body almost boyishly slim in the lamp light. She stooped and gathered her robe, dropped it across the bench beside the door and stepped naked into Lannon’s bed. The other girl went to snuff the lamp, and Huy rose from the deck with his lute slung on his shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">A voice hailed from the darkness, a great bull bellow from the edge of the papyrus beds that carried across the water to the flagship.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Open your lines for a friend!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who calls himself friend?’ One of the guards shouted a challenge, and the reply was bellowed hoarsely.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mursil, huntmaster of house Barca.’ And Lannon was out of his bed in one bound.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He has come!’ he exclaimed, flinging his cloak over his shoulders and hurrying to the companion ladder with Huy scampering beside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">A small canoe bumped alongside and Mursil came up through the entry-port as Lannon and Huy reached the deck, a huge figure, gross and apelike with his big beefy round face ruddy from sun and wine.</p>

  <p class="normal">The ship was awake now. Her officers swarming up onto the deck, new torches flaring to light the scene as day, the bustle and hum of excitement affecting them all.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mursil saw Lannon and hurried to him down the aisle which opened for him across the crowded deck. He was followed closely by a pygmy figure, a tiny brown naked manikin that looked about him from slanted eyes in obvious terror at these unfamiliar surroundings.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord.’ Mursil opened his cloak and dropped heavily to one knee in front of Lannon. ‘I bring good news.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then you are welcome.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This one,’ Mursil reached behind him and dragged the little bushman forward, ‘this one has found what we seek.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You have seen it?’ Lannon demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The tracks of his paws only, but this one has seen the beast itself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If it is true, you will be well rewarded, both of you,’ promised Lannon Hycanus and turned to grin triumphantly at Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The gods have decided. House Barca will have its chance once more.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The sky was only a shade lighter than the black brooding swampland, the dawn-flighting duck ghost-whistled unseen overhead and each minute the light strengthened.</p>

  <p class="normal">Half a mile out on the open plain a herd of buffalo grazed in a dark bunch. Heads down, tails swinging lazily, they moved back steadily towards the tall dense banks of papyrus reed.</p>

  <p class="normal">They moved faster as the light strengthened, hurrying to reach the sanctuary of the reed-beds, 200 huge bovine shapes with their armoured heads and bunched black shoulders. Dawn’s first light showed the white tick birds which hovered above the dark herd in a cold pink sheen. The swampy earth smoked with mist and the endless banks of papyrus stood frozen in the hush of dawn, for once their fluffy white heads were not nodding and dancing - except where something moved amongst the reeds.</p>

  <p class="normal">Following its track the papyrus heads stirred, an opening and closing movement that set them nodding briefly before settling into stillness once more. The movement was sedate and yet so weighty that it betrayed the size of the animal which stalked beneath it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The big bull buffalo that led the herd, stopped suddenly fifty yards from the edge of the papyrus bed. He lifted his nose high and spread his ears wide beneath the heavy boss of horn. With little suspicious piggy eyes he examined the bed of reeds ahead of him. Behind him the herd stopped also, alerted by his stillness.</p>

  <p class="normal">The gry-lion came out of the reeds at full charge, a blur of soft roan-brown, an animal as tall and almost as heavy as the quarry it hunted. It crossed the open ground so swiftly that the bull had only begun to turn away before the gry-lion was on him.</p>

  <p class="normal">It landed on his back, curved yellow claws hooked through thick black skin and flesh at shoulder and haunch. The long fangs sank into the back of the buffalo’s neck, holding it steady while one paw reached forward and grasped the bull’s nose. A single powerful wrench twisted the black neck back against the holding fangs, the spine snapped with a sharp report and the bull folded in full run.</p>

  <p class="normal">Before he went down the gry-lion had left him, dropping lightly to the ground, seeming hardly to touch it before he was in the air again, a long arcing leap, flashing soft brown against the pink dawn sky to land easily across the back of an old black cow that ran beside the bull.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lightly as a humming bird flashing from flower to flower, the gry-lion had killed again. Bone breaking sharply in the dawn, the victim carrying the great lion forward in the press of galloping buffalo, and as the cow died the gry-lion was gone, flitting to the next, killing again in one fleeting movement and flitting again.</p>

  <p class="normal">Six times the <span lang="en-US">gry</span>-lion killed before the surging, plunging, panicking herd had run 300 paces. Then he let them run, the thunder of their hooves dwindled, a far bank of papyrus swallowed them and they were gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">The gry-lion stood in the silky light of dawn. His long, black-tufted tail still slashed from side to side with the thrill of the hunt. Every muscle was tight and swollen and the great beast half crouched, the flat snakelike head lifted as though to counter the weight of those long white fangs that curved down almost to touch the fluffy fur of his chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">The face mask was elaborately patterned in black and startling white, an effect that enhanced the golden glowing savagery in the wide-set eyes, but the whiskers and eyelashes were long white bristle, and seemed to soften the animal’s expression. However, when it stood up from its crouch, with the short ruff of mulberry-brown mane along its back still fully erect, any illusion of softness vanished.</p>

  <p class="normal">As tall as a man, and as heavy as a horse, armed with those legendary fangs and claws, this was the most dangerous cat that all nature’s twists and evolutions had ever produced.</p>

  <p class="normal">The cat turned and paced back to where its last victim lay in the short grass of the plain. It stood over the dead buffalo, and it seemed impossible that such a large animal could move as swiftly as this one had at the height of the hunt.</p>

  <p class="normal">The gry-lion lifted its head, the massive jaws parted, the long pink tongue curled out between those unbelievable fangs, and it roared.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a sound that seemed to shake the purple skies of dawn, that made the earth shudder and ruffled the quiet waters of the great lake.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">In the dawn, upon the narrow muddy beach beside the reed banks, Huy Ben-Amon greeted his god. Huy wore light hunting armour of leather, a leather breastplate and arm-guards over a short linen tunic and bronze-studded leather kilt, but his weapons were laid aside, for he was about to offer the sacrifice, to send a messenger to great Baal. A messenger to carry the request of Lannon Hycanus to his god. The prince and his nobles were gathered in a half circle about the priest, all of them facing the eastern sky. Baal showed the tip of his fiery orb above the horizon, and they lifted their hands to him. Fingers spread in the sun-sign.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Great Baal,’ Huy called the greeting in sweet shimmering tones that seemed must carry to the sky. ‘Your children greet you!’ Huy’s swarthy, beak-nosed features were lit by a mystic glow which gave him a strange beauty.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have come to this place to choose a king for your people and we ask your blessing on our endeavours.’ Huy knew his gods intimately, and though he loved them yet he knew their all too human weaknesses. They were vain, inconsistent, touchy, greedy and sometimes bone-lazy. They must be flattered and cajoled, bribed and jollied along, they needed special ceremony and display to capture their jaded interest and attention, sacrifice, which Huy personally found revolting, to assuage their lust for warm blood. It was not enough that sacrifice was made, it must be made in all the correct forms before the gods would accept it, and as one of his lesser priests led the white bull forward Huy wondered if he had done the right thing in persuading Lannon to offer an animal rather than a slave. The gods preferred human blood, but Huy had argued with Lannon that a bull now and the promise of a slave later might be more effective. Huy had no compunction in bargaining with the great immortals, especially if it delayed the moment when he must look into the terrified, pleading eyes of a doomed slave. In the five years that Huy had directed the religious life of Opet, not more than 100 human messengers had been sent to the gods. Whereas there had been times in the city’s history when that number had been sent at a single ceremony.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We send you a fine white bull to carry our message.’ Huy turned and approached the animal. It was of the short stocky Opet type, white and grey dappled, with a fat hump on its shoulders and wide straight horns. It stood quietly as Huy took the vulture axe from one of his priests. The circle of nobles drew back a little, giving the axe space to swing and the blood to spurt.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Great Baal, receive our messenger!’ Huy shouted, and the axe went up, reflecting the low rays of the sun from its flashing blade. It hissed angrily as it fell, and the bull’s thick neck severed cleanly, the head seeming to leap from the trunk. Headless, the body fell to its knees and the blood pumped and gushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy leaned upon his weapon in the typical stance of the resting axeman.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A sign, great Baal!’ Huy shouted, making it more a demand than a request. ‘Give your children a sign!’ And his voice was tiny in the immensity of swamp and sky and water. The timeless silence of the swamps fell upon them, the silence of the ages in the smoky purple dawn.</p>

  <p class="normal">A flight of spur-winged geese passed overhead, wings beating heavily, long necks outstretched, silhouetted darkly against the rosy streamers of sun-touched mist. Huy watched them hopefully, tempted to claim them as god-forms.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A sign, great Baal!’ He thrust aside the temptation, but his irritation was increasing. The sacrifice had been meticulously performed right down to the single clean stroke of the axe - was this to be one of those occasions when the god’s attention had wandered, or was he being obstinate, pig-headed? A hippopotamus splashed and snorted out in the bay, and Huy turned towards it expectantly, but the fat grey sea-cow merely fluttered its ears like bees’ wings, then submerged with a swirl.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A sign, great Baal!’ The third and final request, and almost immediately it was answered.</p>

  <p class="normal">A sound rose from beyond the papyrus beds that startled the water birds into flight, that shook the fluffy white heads of the reeds, that seemed to roll across the heavens like thunder. A sound such as none of them had ever heard before. The roaring of the gry-lion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy’s dark scowl vanished beneath a beatific smile, and he turned those long-lashed gazelle eyes on his prince.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The gods have answered you, Lannon Hycanus.’ He was seeing the faces of the priests and nobles and warriors and huntsmen, the superstitious awe with which they gazed at him. He would sacrifice privately to Baal later, nothing ostentatious or expensive, a chicken perhaps, as a gesture of thanks for this magnificent cooperation. It would rank with one of his best performances ever. Huy was so delighted with his success that he could not resist a further histrionic gesture.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Go out, Prince of Opet, and take your gry-lion,’ said Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The little bushman led them along one of the buffalo paths. It was a green tunnel of reeds, the papyrus closing overhead to hide the sky, the damp peaty swamp earth underfoot, the musty animal swamp smell in their nostrils. They came out at last into the open grassland. Short, bright green grass cropped down by the countless herds of buffalo that infested this reach of the shore.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bushman turned and led them along the edge of the papyrus-beds. They were an unwieldy procession, four or five hundred strong, for some of the noble nine would not come ashore to look for the gry-<span lang="en-US">lion</span> without a thick screen of archers and axemen around them. They trailed far behind Lannon’s party which consisted of Mursil the huntmaster, smelling richly of fruity Zeng wine, the bushman, Huy, the prince and his two arms-bearers.</p>

  <p class="normal">The gods were as good as their promise that morning. The bushman led them around a bank of papyrus that thrust out into the plain like an accuser’s finger, and as they turned the point of it they came upon another bay of open grassland. It was a natural arena, fenced on three sides by the stands of dark reeds, a huge circular extent of lush grass about half a mile across.</p>

  <p class="normal">Down the centre of this opening, lying at regular intervals, were six large dark objects, clearly visible on the open plain, but the range was too long for immediate identification.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mursil, the huntmaster, spoke quickly to the pygmy scout in a formless dialect. Huy made a note to study this language, it was the only spoken word in all the four kingdoms in which he was not fluent.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, he says they are dead buffalo killed by the gry-lion,’ Mursil translated on <em>a</em> warm wave of wine fumes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where is the beast?’ Lannon asked, and the bushman pointed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is there, behind the second carcass. It has seen and heard us, and it is lying hidden,’ Mursil explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can he see it?’ Lannon demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, my lord. He can see the tips of its ears and its eyes. It is watching us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘At that distance?’ Lannon asked with disbelief, looking down at the bushman. ‘I do not believe it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is true, my lord. He has the eyes of an eagle.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘At your peril, if he is mistaken,’ Lannon warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘At my peril,’ Mursil agreed readily, and Lannon turned to Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Make ready, my bird of the sun.’</p>

  <p class="normal">While they stripped Lannon of his armour, bound his loins in a cloth of linen, and set light hunting sandals on his feet, the rest of the party straggled up. Some of the older nobles were in litters. Asmun, looking frail and white-haired, stopped his bearers beside Lannon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A clean kill,’ he wished the prince. ‘Like the one your father made.’ And they carried him to where he could have a view of the field. The party spread out along the edge of the reed bank, their arms and armour glinting in the sunlight, their robes purple and white and red, spots of gay colour against the dark reed-beds. A silence fell upon them as Lannon stepped forward and turned to face them.</p>

  <p class="normal">His body was naked but for the loin-cloth, and the skin was smooth and startlingly white except where the sun had gilded his face and limbs. It was a beautiful body, tall and gracefully proportioned, heavy in the shoulder and narrow at waist and belly. His curls were bound with a purple headband and his red-gold beard was clubbed and turned up against his throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked at the waiting ranks before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I make claim to the city of Opet, and all the four kingdoms,’ he said with simplicity, and his voice carried clearly to every one of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy took his weapons to him. The shield. Hide of the buffalo, shaped in a long oval, tall as a man and as wide as his shoulders. In its centre were the ‘eyes’, a pair of fierce owl eyes painted in white and yellow. When these were exposed to a beast they represented the natural aggressive stare which would usually trigger the charge of a predator.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘May this shield cover you well,’ Huy told him softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank you, old friend.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Next Huy offered him the lion spear. This was such a heavy cumbersome weapon that only a powerful man could handle it. The shaft was of carefully selected hard wood, fire-treated, and bound with green leather which had been allowed to dry and shrink upon it. It was as thick as Lannon’s wrist, and twice as tall as he was.</p>

  <p class="normal">The unbarbed blade was in proportion wide and heavy, bound into the shaft with leather strips, the round point honed to a razor edge. It was designed to allow the maximum penetration into flesh and, once buried, to open a massive wound that would induce heavy bleeding.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘May this blade find the heart,’ Huy whispered, and then louder. ‘Roar for me, Gry-Lion of Opet.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon reached out and touched the priest’s shoulder. He squeezed it briefly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fly for me, bird of the sun,’ he said and turned away. With the shield on his back, careful not to show the ‘eyes’, Lannon walked out towards the waiting beast. He walked tall and proud in the sunlight, a king in all but name, and Huy’s heart went with him. Quietly Huy began to pray, hoping that the gods were still attentive.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon strode through the soft grass that brushed his knees. As he went he remembered the advice of the oldest and best of his huntmasters, rehearsing each move, each word of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wait until he growls before you show him the eyes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Make him come to you at an angle.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He charges with head held low. You must open his chest from the side.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The skull is like iron, the bones of the shoulders will turn the finest metal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is one place only. The base of the neck, between spine and shoulder.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the words of the only man amongst them all who had ever faced the gry-lion, Hamilcar Barca, the forty-sixth Gry-Lion of Opet, ‘Once the spear is in, hold it, my son, cling to it with your life. For the gry-lion is still alive and that shaft is all that will keep him from you until he dies.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon walked on steadily watching the black swollen-bellied carcass of the buffalo, seeing no sign of the beast he was hunting.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are mistaken,’ he thought. ‘There is nothing here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He could hear his own heart beating in the silence, his own footfalls, and the hiss and suck of his breath. He watched the dead buffalo and walked on, tucking the butt of the lion spear more firmly under his right armpit.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is nothing here. The gry-lion has gone,’ he thought, then suddenly he saw movement ahead of him. Just the flick of two ears held erect for a moment then flattened again, but he knew that it was there waiting for him. He felt his steps begin to drag, feet heavy with fear, but he forced himself onwards.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fear is the destroyer,’ he thought, and tried to force it down, but it was a cold heavy thing like oil in his guts. He walked on, and suddenly the gry-lion stood up beside the carcass of the buffalo. It stood facing him, with ears erect, its tail swinging lazily, head up, watching him, and Lannon gasped aloud. He had not expected it to be so large. He missed a step, hesitating. It was huge, unbelievable, like something from a nightmare.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was 200 paces from it, and he walked on towards it, concealing the ‘eyes’, and watching the giant cat’s tail swish faster with agitation as he approached.</p>

  <p class="normal">A hundred paces from it, and now the tail began to slash angrily, like a whip against the gry-lion’s flanks. The cat crouched a little, the ears flattening against the skull. Lannon could see the eyes now, hot yellow eyes in the patterned face-mask.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked on, and the gry-lion’s ruff of mane came erect, swelling out the shape of its head, it sank a little lower into its crouch. Its tail slashed furiously, and Lannon walked on towards it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Fifty paces separated them now, and the gry-lion growled. It was the muttering menace of distant thunder, the drumming of the earth in quake, a belly-jarring sound like the crash of surf on a storm-swept beach. Lannon stopped, he could not walk on with that sound in his ears. He stood frozen, staring at this terrible animal in its mounting rage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Long seconds he hesitated, then with an abrupt movement born of tear he swept the shield from his back and showed the ‘eyes’. The glaring roundels were all that was needed to precipitate the beast’s anger. The black tufted tail froze rigid, lifted slightly above the level of its back, the head dropped low against its chest, and it charged.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the same moment as the charge began Lannon went up on his toes, and jumped forward. The shackles of fear fell from his limbs, and he bounded towards the charging cat with long light strides. He was angling his run across the gry-lion’s front, forcing it to keep turning towards him, bringing it in at an angle, exposing the neck and the side of the chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Lannon ran the spear blade danced above the earth ahead of him, like a firefly of light in the sun.</p>

  <p class="normal">The gry-lion came fast, and low, head down so that the incredible fangs almost touched its chest, curved and ivory pale. It seemed to snake against the grass as it closed for the kill, and its enormous bulk filled the whole of Lannon’s vision.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the last possible instant Lannon lifted the spear-tip slightly, centring it on the vital spot at the base of the neck, and the gry-lion came on to the spear with its whole weight driving it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The blade plunged into the brown furry body, sucked into unresisting flesh, and the shock of the impact drove up the shaft and hurled Lannon backwards onto his knees - but he held on to the spear.</p>

  <p class="normal">A storm raged about him, great waves of sound engulfed him, battering his eardrums, as the gry-lion roared out its death throes. The shaft of the lion-spear whipped and thrashed in his grip, smashing against his ribs, crushing and bruising his flesh, shaking him so his teeth clashed together in his skull lacerating his tongue. He clung to the spear.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was lifted from his feet, riding high on the shaft of the spear as the gry-lion reared, then he was smashed down onto the earth again as the great cat plunged. He felt muscle and sinew tear in his arm and shoulders, felt the gry-lion’s claws raking the flimsy leather shield, felt weakness in his body and darkness in his head, but still the storm raged and shook him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once more the gry-lion roared and reared. Lannon felt himself hurled towards the heavens, the shaft of the lion-spear snapped like a brittle twig, and Lannon was thrown with the butt of it still in his hands. He flew for long seconds, bird free, then earth thumped the breath from his lungs. Painfully he dragged himself into a sitting position, and looked around him stunned, clutching the broken shaft of the spear to his chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ten paces away the gry-lion was crawling towards him through the grass. The broken hilt of the spear protruded from the exact spot in the neck where Lannon had aimed. The gry-lion’s throes had worked the blade mercilessly in its own flesh, opening a hideous wound from which the bright heart blood pumped, but the gry-lion’s yellow eyes were still upon him, and those great curved fangs gleamed for his flesh.</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly it crawled towards him, its breath drumming in the mighty throat, dragging its paralysed hind quarters, dying but still deadly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Die,’ thought Lannon, watching it with fascination, crushed by the conflict, unable to move. ‘Die,’ he thought. ‘Please die.’ And suddenly the final spasm caught the giant cat. Its back arched, the legs stiffened, claws ripping into the earth, the mouth opened wide and pink, and it groaned. One last long pitiful groan, and it died.</p>

  <p class="normal">The half circle of watchers shouted, a cheer that was lost in the great silence of the swamps, and they began moving forward slowly towards the tiny figure of the king out on the grassy plain. But Huy was running. On legs too long for his crumpled trunk he seemed to dance over the ground, his long black tresses flowing out behind him and the vulture axe on his shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was halfway to where Lannon sat bowed in the grass when the second gry-lion stood up from where it had lain concealed behind the carcass of the nearest buffalo, Huy saw it and shouted as he ran.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lannon! Behind you! Beware!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon looked back and saw it. It was the female, lighter in colour, daintier in build, but notoriously more savage than the male. It moved towards Lannon with the deadly concentration of a stalking cat.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Baal speed me!’ Huy prayed as he ran towards his prince, and saw him trying to struggle to his feet. The gry-lion was slinking low along the ground, moving forward in short dashes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy ran with all his might, driven by horror and fear for his prince, Lannon was on his feet now, reeling weakly away from the stalking cat. The movement triggered the hunting reflex of the gry-lion, it closed remorselessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy shouted at it. ‘Here!’ he yelled. ‘Come!’ And the cat noticed him for the first time. It lifted its head and looked at him. The fangs glinting long and pale, the eyes yellow and splendid.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes!’ shouted Huy. ‘Here I am!’ He saw Lannon stagger and fall, dropping out of sight into the grass, but he watched the beast. Saw the tail stiffen and the head drop. It began its charge, and Huy checked his.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood to meet the gry-lion, braced on long powerful legs, with the axe on his shoulder, and he let the cat come straight.</p>

  <p class="normal">As it closed he fastened his gaze on the black diamond pattern between the gry-lion’s eyes, and he adjusted his grip on the axe, settling it carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">The axe went up and the gry-lion covered the last few paces in a soft roan-coloured blur of fluid movement, towering over the little hunchback.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For Baal!’ howled Huy and the axe moaned in flight. The blade cracked into skull, buried in the gry-lion’s brain and was instantly torn from his grip as the full weight of the dead beast smashed into his chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy came back from deep down and tar away along a tunnel of roaring darkness, and when he opened his eyes Lannon, Hycanus, the forty-seventh Gry-Lion of Opet, knelt over him in the sunlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The fool,’ said the king, his own face bruised and swollen, caked with drying blood. ‘Oh! The brave little fool.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Brave, yes,’ whispered Huy painfully. ‘But fool never, Majesty.’ And saw the relief dawn in Lannon’s eyes.‘</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">They spread the wet skins of the two gry-lions on the main mast of the flagship, and Lannon Hycanus received the oaths of allegiance from the heads of the nine houses of Opet while reclining on a couch of soft fur beneath them. Huy Ben-Amon carried the cup of life, despite the protests of his king.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You must rest, Huy. You are badly wounded, I believe the ribs of your chest are stove—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, I am the cup-bearer. Would you deny me that honour?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Asmun was the first of the nine to make oath. His sons helped him from the litter, but he shrugged away their hands as he approached Lannon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In respect of the snow upon your brow, and the scars of your body, you need not kneel, Asmun.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will kneel, my king,’ replied Asmun, and went down on the deck in the sunlight. Baal must witness the oath of this frail old man. When Huy held the cup of life to his lips he sipped it, and Huy carried the cup to the king. He drank and then offered it back to Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Drink also, my priest.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is not the custom,’ Huy demurred.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The King of Opet and the four kingdoms makes the custom. Drink!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy hesitated a moment longer, then lifted the cup and took a long draught. By the time Habbakuk Lal, the last of the nine, came forward the cup had been refilled five times with the heavy sweet wine of Zeng.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do your wounds still trouble you?’ Lannon asked softly as Huy brought the cup to him for the last time.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Majesty, I feel no pain,’ Huy replied and then giggled suddenly and spilled a drop of wine down the king’s chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fly high, Sunbird,’ laughed Lannon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Roar loudly, Gry-Lion,’ said Huy, and laughed with him. Lannon turned to the nobles who crowded the steering deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is food and drink.’ The ceremony was over, Lannon Hycanus was king. ‘Habbakuk Lal!’ Lannon picked out the big ginger-bearded seaman with his freckled and sea-brined face.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Will you weigh, and set for Opet?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A night run?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, I wish to reach the city before noon tomorrow, and I trust your seamanship.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Habbakuk Lal inclined his head at the compliment and the heavy gold earrings dangled against his cheek. Then he turned on his heel, and stumped across the deck, bellowing orders at his officers.</p>

  <p class="normal">The anchors came up over the stern, and the drummer on the <span lang="en-US">forecastle</span> of the flagship struck the hollow tree trunk with the wooden drumstick, beating out the rhythm for the racing start.</p>

  <p class="normal">Three swift, two slow, three swift. The bank of oars dipped and swung and rose and swung forward and dipped to the beat. In perfect unison, an undulating movement, like the wet silver wing-beats of a great water bird. The long narrow hull slicing boldly through the sunset blush of lake water, the clean run of the wake streaming out behind her, the standard of house Barca hoisted at the crosstree of her masthead and her high castles fore and aft standing tall and proud above the papyrus banks on either hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">As she swept past the other vessels of the fleet they dipped their standards, and fell in behind the flagship. Each of them holding their station meticulously in line ahead, the steersmen leaning on the rudder oar and the drum-beats booming out across the lake.</p>

  <p class="normal">His hobbling gait was all that betrayed Huy’s discomfort as he moved from group to group upon the torch-lit deck, with each of them he pointed the bottom of the wine bowl to the starry bright night sky, and bounced the ivory dice across the deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Damn your luck,’ laughed Philo, but the laughter did not hide the anger in his brooding gypsy dark features. ‘Am I mad to dice with a favourite of the gods?’ But he stacked gold upon the board, covering Huy’s pile, and Huy scooped the dice and threw the three black fish again. Philo pulled his robes closer about him and moved away with the laughter and the shouted gibes of the watchers following him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bright white star of Astarte had set when at last Lannon and Huy stood together beneath the spread skins of the gry-lions and looked about the deck. It was a battlefield when the battle is spent. The bodies lay strewn about in the torch light, lying where they had fallen, loose and senseless. A wine bowl rolled back and forth with the easy motion of the ship that still sped on into the darkness.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Another victory,’ Lannon spoke thickly, peering blearily around at the carnage.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A notable victory. Majesty.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think,’ Lannon began, but did not finish. His legs buckled under him. He swayed and swung forward. Huy caught him neatly as he fell, and settled him across one shoulder. Ignoring the pain in his chest he lifted the king and carried him down to the main cabin below the deck. He dropped Lannon on the bed, and arranged his limbs and head more comfortably. A moment longer he stayed, hanging over the supine figure.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sweet sleep, my beautiful king,’ he blurted and turned to stagger away to his own cabin. The slave girl rose at his entrance.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have set out your writing pallet,’ she told him, and Huy peered at the scroll, ink bowl and stylus under the hanging lamp.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not tonight.’ He started towards the bed, lost direction, crashed into the bulkhead and bounced backwards. The slave girl ran to help him, and steered him into port.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy lay on his back and looked up at her. She was one of Lannon’s household. Huy wished he could afford one like her, but she would fetch ten fingers of gold at the least.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is there anything else, my lord?’ she asked. She was a pretty little thing with dark soft hair and pale ivory-yellow skin. Huy closed one eye the better to focus on her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Perhaps,’ he said shyly. ‘If you will help a little.’ But his aspirations were too ambitious, and in a few moments his snores shook the ship to its keel. The girl rose, pulled on her robe and for a moment smiled down at him before she slipped out of the cabin.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the darkness before dawn Huy stood on the forecastle of the galley and worked the axe, keeping it in flight, humming and hissing in the gloom. He felt the sluggish old wine in his veins begin to course faster, the sweat broke out on his body that the cool lake air could not quench. He changed hands smoothly on the cut, and the great axe sang. The dullness in his head lightened and the sweat poured now, streaming down his muscled legs and arms, over the bull-humped back, soaking the loin-cloth, running into his eyes, and Huy began to dance, lightly he spun and leapt and weaved, and still the axe flew.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dawn was pinking the sky when at last he stopped and leaned upon the axe. His breath steamed and gasped in the cold stream of air, but his blood raced through his body and he felt like a man again.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the cabin one of Lannon’s slave girls scraped the sweat from his body with the gold strigil that was a gift from Lannon. Then she rubbed him down with perfumed oil, plaited and set his hair and beard, and held a loose unbelted robe of white linen for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He came up on the steering-deck just as the order to heave to was passed to the fleet, and they swung towards the east to await the coming of the sun with the slave oarsmen collapsing thankfully over their oars. As the sun showed over the horizon Huy led the praise chant to Baal. Then there was breakfast on the open deck with the company squatting on mats of plaited reeds. Huy looked at their faces, grey and crumpled, baggy-eyed and bad-tempered. Even Lannon was pale and his hands shook as he breakfasted on a bowl of warm milk and honey.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy started on millet cakes dripping with oil and honey, then he ate a large smoked and salted lake bream, and when he called for a broiled duck reeking with rank wild garlic and more millet cakes the company watched him with awe. Huy ripped the duck to pieces and forced an expression of relish as he ate, for he was jealous of his reputation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Philo spoke for them all when he cried at last ‘Great Baal! You insult not only your own belly but mine as well.’ And he jumped up and hurried below.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He is right,’ Lannon laughed for the first time that day. ‘You look like a child who has drunk nothing more poisonous than his mother’s milk.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He was weaned on red Zeng wine, and he cut his teeth on the blade of a battle-axe.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If the lake was wine he would lower the level so we could walk across.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy twinkled at them like a mischievous gnome, and tore another leg from the carcass of the duck.</p>

  <p class="normal"><a id="ff"></a>In the middle of the morning they reached the shallows and Habbakuk Lal went forward to pilot the ship through the narrow channel. Water hyacinth, papyrus and a dozen other varieties of vegetation threatened to clog the lifeline of Opet. The channel boats pulled out of the lane as the ten great ships flew past on their silver-wet wings. The officers saluted the standard of Barca at the masthead with a clenched fist, but the slave gangs who were doomed for ever to fight the lake weed stood dumbly and watched with patient animal eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Closer to Opet now they began passing the fishing fleet, the nets coming in over the side with fish shining silver in the mesh like captured stars, and the white clouds of gulls shrieking and fussing overhead.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the cliffs came up on the horizon, glowing dusky red in the sunlight and the rail was crowded with those who were enjoying this moment of homecoming.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mursil, the huntmaster, came to Lannon on the steering deck and knelt briefly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You sent for me, Majesty.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes - and the pygmy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He is here, King.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I promised you a reward. Name it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, I have three wives. All of them avaricious.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Gold?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If it please you, my lord.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Huy, write an order on the treasury for five fingers of gold.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘May Baal shine upon you always!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What of the pygmy?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Mursil called the little yellow bushman to him, and Lannon examined him with interest.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is he named?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Xhai, my lord.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Does he not understand the language?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, my lord, he speaks only his own primitive tongue.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ask him what he desires - freedom, perhaps?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He does not understand the idea of freedom. He is like a dog, Majesty. Deprive him of a master and you deprive him of the reason for life.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ask him what he wants.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Mursil and the bushman spoke for a long while in that birdlike chittering tongue, before the huntmaster turned back to the king.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is a strange request.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Name it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He wishes to hunt with the slayer of the gry-lion.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon stared at the bushman, who grinned at him with the beguiling candour of a child.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He thinks, my lord, and you will forgive the impertinence,’ Mursil was sweating a little, ill at ease, ‘he thinks you are a god, and he wants to belong to you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon let out a bull roar of laughter and slapped his thigh.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So be it then. He is elevated to a master of the royal hunt - with the pay and privileges. Take him, Huy. Teach him to speak the language, or failing that learn to speak his!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the strays and cripples,’ thought Huy ruefully. His household was filled with them, whenever he had accumulated sufficient gold tor a luscious young slave maid it went on another who was too old or infirm to justify his keep and who was consigned by his master to the pool of Astarte. At least the pygmy would have his pay as a huntmaster to help with the costs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon dismissed the subject and turned back to the rail. The mother city came up over the horizon at last. The walls of the temple shone a ruddy rose in the sunlight, and the lower city was brilliant white, the walls of the houses painted with the ash of the lake shellfish.</p>

  <p class="normal">The war fleet of Opet streamed out from the harbour to meet them. The shields and helmets of the legionaries sparkled in the sun as each ship in turn wheeled across the flagship’s bows with the gilt work on her arrow-sharp prow catching the sunlight. They saw the raw skins hanging below the standard of house Barca and a cheer roared out across the water.</p>

  <p class="normal">The flagship led them into the harbour, still scudding to the drive of her banked oars. Habbakuk Lal aimed at the stone jetty below the city where the crowds thronged the shore. The entire population of the city was out in their best and most brilliant robes, shrieking and cheering their new king from 100,000 throats.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the last possible moment Habbakuk Lal dropped his hand in a signal to the drummer and steersman. The ship spun on her heel, with every oar clawing at the water to drag her to a halt, her side lightly touching the stone jetty. Lannon Hycanus and his train stepped ashore.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon’s wives were the first to greet him. Nine of them, one from each of the noble houses, young matrons of the blood, proud and beautiful. Each one came forward to kneel before Lannon, and call him ‘sire’ for the first time.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy looked at them with a heart that ached. These were not the pliant, brainless slave girls whose company was all he had ever known. These were full women. He needed someone like that to share a life with, and he had tried so hard. He had carried his suit to every one of the great houses of Opet, and had it rejected. They could see no further than his back, and he could not blame them for it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The dignity of the occasion was abruptly shattered by a loud chorus of ‘Hoo! Hoo!’ and the twins broke away from their nursemaids and raced each other across the jetty. Ignoring their father and the gathered nobles, they ran to Huy and danced about him, tugging at his robe and demanding his attention. When he picked them up they competed so fiercely for his kisses that it developed into a hair-pulling bout. The nursemaids flew to the rescue and dragged them away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Imilce’s hands still locked in Helanca’s golden tresses, and from the scowl on Lannon’s face Huy knew that there would be retribution and that those plump little bottoms would soon be glowing red. He wished there was some way he could prevent it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy slipped away into the crowd. On the way to the temple he haggled for a chicken with one of the merchants and struck a good bargain. After he had sacrificed he went to his own house in the precinct of the priests between the outer and inner wall of the temple. His household were all there to meet him, doting and doddering, fussing about him with their grey heads and toothless gums. All agog for the news of his latest exploits, demanding the story of the hunt, while they bathed and fed him.</p>

  <p class="normal">When at last he escaped to his sleeping quarters to rest, he had not <span lang="en-US">lain</span> tor long when the four eldest princesses arrived. Aged from ten to six, they broke through the feeble defences of his slaves and invaded his room as if by right.</p>

  <p class="normal">With a sigh Huy abandoned rest and sent one of them to fetch his lute, and as he began to sing the slaves, one at a time, crept into the room and sat quietly along the wall. Huy Ben-Amon was home again.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">In the year 533 from the founding of Opet, six months after he had taken the gry-lion and <span lang="en-US">claimed</span> the four kingdoms. Lannon Hycanus, the head of house Barca, left the city of Opet and went out to march around his borders, a custom that would bind his claim irrevocably. He was twenty-nine years old in that spring, a year older than his high priest.</p>

  <p class="normal">He marched with four of his wives, the childless ones, hoping to change their status upon the two-year journey. He took with him two legions each of 6,000 hoplites, light infantry, axemen and archers. The legions were composed mostly of Yuye freedmen with officers from the noble families of Opet. These legions were organized along the Roman lines, in the manner that Hannibal had adopted during his campaign in Italia. There were ten cohorts to a legion and six centuries to a cohort. They were uniformed in leather body armour with conical iron helmets and circular leather shields studded with bronze rosettes. On their legs and feet they wore leather greaves and nailed sandals, and they sang as they marched.</p>

  <p class="normal">The officers were more magnificently appointed as befitted their noble origins. Their armour was of bronze and their cloaks were of fine linen dyed purple and red, and they marched at the head of their divisions.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no cavalry. In 500 years no attempt to bring horses from the north had succeeded. Every one of the animals had succumbed to the sea voyage, or surviving that had died soon after arrival at Opet of a mysterious disease that made their coats stand on end and turned their eyeballs to bloody red jelly.</p>

  <p class="normal">In place of cavalry were the elephants. Huge, ugly-tempered beasts, who struck terror into the hearts of the enemies of Opet when they charged with the archers in the castles upon their backs loosing a shower of arrows as they came on. In battle frenzy, however, they could wreak as much havoc amongst their own army as that of the enemy, and their handlers were equipped with a mallet and spike to drive into the brains of the berserk animals. Lannon took twenty-five of these beasts upon his march.</p>

  <p class="normal">With him went his high priest and a dozen lesser priests, engineers, physicians, armourers, cooks, slaves and a huge flock of camp followers: merchants, prospectors, gamblers, soothsayers, liquor-sellers and prostitutes. The bullock train carrying the tentage and supplies stretched for seven miles, while the whole unwieldy column spread out over fifteen miles. This was no problem in the huge unpeopled grass plains of the south with their plentiful supplies of water and forage, but when Huy Ben-Amon stood on a low hill with his king and saw the slow straggling mass coming down out of the north he thought of the time when they would turn north again in a great circle amongst the forests and broken country along the great river. Such a collection of wealth would be a sore temptation to the pagan war bands from the unknown lands beyond the river. He told Lannon his misgivings and Lannon laughed, crinkling his pale blue eyes into the sun.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You think more like a soldier than a priest.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am both.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Of course.’ Lannon dropped a hand on his shoulder. ‘Not for nothing the command of the sixth legion - well, Huy, I have thought much of this march. In the past, it has always been a great time-waster and a sorry expense on the treasury of Opet. My march will be different. I intend to turn a profit.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy smiled at that magic word, the one understood by all in Opet, noble or commoner, king or priest.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I intend to make this a different type of march. In the south kingdom we will hunt - hunts such as you have never conceived, and the meat will be smoked and dried and sold to the houses and mines to feed their slaves. We will hunt also for elephant. I would like my army to have 200 of these animals to meet the threats from the north of which you have just reminded me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I had wondered at the multitude of empty wagons that follow us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They will be filled before we turn northwards again,’ Lannon promised. ‘And when we pass through the gardens of Zeng, I will change the garrisons there, leaving these men in their place. Troops who stay too long in one billet grow lazy and corrupt. At Zeng I will meet the emissaries of the Dravs from the east and renew our treaty with them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But what of the north?’ Huy came back to his original question.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘From Zeng we will march north in battle array. The women and the others will be sent home to Opet along the road through the middle kingdom. We will come to the river with two full legions to reinforce the two already there, and we will cross the river on a burning and slave-taking raid that will warn the tribes beyond that a new king reigns in Opet.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon turned and glared towards the north, and his mane of golden and red hair and beard shone in the sunlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For a hundred years now they have plagued us, and we have been too soft with them. Each year they have grown more numerous, more daring. I will show them the iron of my hand, Sunbird. I will show them that the river is held by a barrier of bright steel, and they will press against it at their cost.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where do they come from, I wonder, and how many of them are there?’ Huy asked softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are the hosts of darkness, black because they are not of the sun-god Baal as we are. They were spawned in darkness in the forests of eternal night to the north, and when you can number the greedy locusts, then you will count them also.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you afraid, Lannon?’ Huy asked, and the king turned to him with a fiery anger darkening his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You presume, priest,’ he snarled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Call me friend, not priest - and I do presume to show you that unreasoning hatred is based on fear.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon’s anger faded, and he fiddled with the hilt of his sword, glancing about to make sure that his aides were out of earshot.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is reason for fear,’ he said at last.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know,’ said Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Huy led the praise chant to Baal in the dawn, but they kept the volume of their voices low so as not to alarm the nearest herds, and afterwards Huy asked the gods to look with favour upon the hunt, promising that a part of the spoils would be left for the Sunbirds to carry on high. Then Huy and Lannon drank a bowl of wine and ate a dry millet cake together as they waited for the hunt to develop.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mursil, the huntmaster of the south, had chosen the ground with cunning and care. From where they sat on the low line of the escarpment they could look down the vast funnel-shaped plain hemmed in by hills on either hand; along the summit of the hills the signal fires smoked in the early morning to show that the warriors were in position there to turn any of the game that tried to cross out of the valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the distance, beyond the range of the eye the two legions were spread out across the plain. Already they were moving forward, 10,000 men, sweeping the grassland like a wave across the beach. The dust of their advance rose palely against the egg-shell blue of the morning sky, and below the pall an occasional flash of light came from helmet or spear.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It has begun,’ said Lannon with satisfaction.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy looked out on the tens of thousands of grazing animals scattered in herds about the plain. This was the tenth great hunt in fifty days, and the slaughter was beginning to sicken him a little.</p>

  <p class="normal">He glanced down to where the plain narrowed and the river that bisected it ran down onto the neck. At the base, squeezed into a wedge shape by the hills, was a gap of 500 paces which promised escape to the limitless expanse of grassland beyond. The whole plain was thinly scattered with tall flat-topped acacia trees.</p>

  <p class="normal">Even from where they sat above the gap they could barely see the treble line of concealed pits across the gap that joined the spurs of the two ranges of hills. A thousand of Lannon’s archers lay in ambush there, each with a bundle of 300 arrows and a spare bow.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beyond them still was a double line of netting, heavy woven mesh standing on flimsy poles that would collapse when a heavy body charged into it, smothering the animal in its folds until one of the hoplites could jump up from his hiding-place and run forward with a javelin to dispatch the animal and reset the net. Here another 1,000 javelin throwers lay in waiting.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We should go down now.’ Lannon finished the last of the wine and brushed a few crumbs from his cloak.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A little longer,’ Huy suggested. ‘I should like to watch this.’</p>

  <p class="normal">A restlessness was running through the herds upon the plain, beginning with the animals nearest the lines of beaters. The long lines of gnu began running in aimless circles with their noses almost raking the ground, black bodies with long flowing manes kicking and frolicking. The herds of zebra grouped themselves in compact masses of some 200 or 300 animals and looked curiously towards the line of approaching beaters. Their close relatives, the quagga, short and sturdier, assembled in lesser herds, a darker bay colour than the grey zebra. Mixed with them were herds of brilliant yellow and red hartebeest, purple sassaby, and the great bovine eland, striped and maned and majestic. This vast multitude began a stirring and moving, a general slow retreat down the valley towards the gap - and the dust rose around them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ah,’ said Lannon. ‘What a booty.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There could never have been a greater in the history of the hunt,’ Huy agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How many, do you think?’ Lannon asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not know - fifty, a hundred thousand - it would not be possible to count them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the long-necked giraffe were infected by the growing alarm, they left the shelter of the acacia trees and their calves followed them as they joined the mass movement down the valley. Amongst the host trotted an occasional rhinoceros, big and cumbersome, horned and snorting, lifting his massive hooves high as he ran,</p>

  <p class="normal">Like a flux holding the entire mass together moved the smoky brown herds of dainty springbok. They came on down the valley, moving more urgently, like flood waters, and the dust rose thicker, swirling up in choking clouds. The hills squeezed the herds into a denser mass, and when the harte-beest and sassaby tried to cross the ridges on either hand there was a line of screaming, weapon-brandishing men to meet and turn them from the crest. They charged down the slopes again carrying and spreading the panic through the closely packed herds below.</p>

  <p class="normal">They surged forward, and the sound of their hooves rose like the sound of storm, surf and wind. The ground began to shake. ‘Come,’ shouted Lannon and he jumped up and went bounding down the slope. For a moment longer Huy watched that unbelievable phalanx of living creatures thundering down on the gap, then he shouldered his axe and went racing down the slope after Lannon. His long black hair streamed out behind him, and he ran goat-footed, rabbit fast, so that he and Lannon came out on the plain together and Huy led the way into the centre of the gap where a pit had been dug for them and a dozen bundles of javelins lay ready.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon jumped down beside him. ‘There was no gold on that race,’ he laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There should have been,’ said Huy, and they went to the front lip of the pit and looked up the valley. It was a terrifying sight. The entire valley from side to side was clogged with a great tide of living things, and above them rose a high brown wall of dust through which the low sun glared bale-fully.</p>

  <p class="normal">The heads and manes of the lead animals tossed and heaved like the surface of a torrent, and above them rose the stick-like necks of the giraffe and ostrich. The whole bore down upon them, and the earth trembled beneath them and they stared in awe and wonder.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon was judging his moment carefully, waiting for the first wave of game to cross his range-markers. The moment came and he snapped an order to his trumpeter. The single urgent note of the attack rang out, repeated stridently over and over again.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the earth at the feet of the advancing wall of living things rose the line of archers. They loosed four times before the wall swept over them. Four thousand arrows in twenty seconds and those that followed fell over the wind-rows of dead animals, screaming with the agony of broken bone and arrow-impaled flesh.</p>

  <p class="normal">Borne by the weight of their own forward momentum the masses of game pressed onwards while flight after flight of arrows decimated their ranks, and the corpses and wounded piled in ridges and huge mounds.</p>

  <p class="normal">The smaller game were wiped out by the archers, but the larger thick-skinned animals came through with the arrows bristling in their flanks. Great grey rhinoceros, lumbering wild-eyed towards the line of nets, tossing their long curved nose horns. Giraffe galloping long-legged and terror-driven. A squadron of black buffalo running in a mass, shoulder to shoulder like a team in span.</p>

  <p class="normal">They came into the nets, and fell struggling and screaming. The javelins whipped into them as they rolled and roared, smothered in the folds of heavy netting. Desperately Lannon and his men worked to clear the dead from the netting and reset the poles, but it was effort wasted. There were too many of them now, and there was death out there in the open beyond the security of the pits. Arrow-maddened, the wounded game charged for any man who showed himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy saw a soldier tossed by an angry rhinoceros. He cartwheeled in the air, and fell on the hard earth to be kicked and trampled to a muddy pulp in the dust by the hordes that followed.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the pit now Lannon hurled his javelins with an uncanny accuracy and power, aiming each bolt for the soft ribs behind the shoulder of the passing game. He piled the bodies about the pit, shouting and laughing in the frenzied excitement of the hunt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy also was infected by it. He danced and shouted and waved his axe, guarding Lannon’s back and flank, hurling a javelin when some huge animal seemed about to crash into the pit on top of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Both he and Lannon were soaked with their own sweat and caked with the swirling dust; a stone flung by a dashing hoof had cut Huy’s forehead open to the bone of the skull and he ripped the hem from his tunic and bound the wound quickly, hardly interrupting his dance of excitement.</p>

  <p class="normal">In front of them the archers had been overwhelmed by the sheer weight of animal flesh. With their arrows exhausted they cowered in their pits and let the solid ranks pour over them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy saw the fresh ranks driving down on them and he grabbed his blood-crazed king and dragged him struggling to the floor of the pit, and they lay with their heads covered by their arms while the edges of the pit crumbled in on top of them under the impact of hooves. Earth smothered them and they covered their faces with the hems of their tunics and gasped for breath.</p>

  <p class="normal">A young zebra stallion fell into the pit on top of them, kicking and neighing in terror, with its powerful yellow teeth snapping indiscriminately; it was a deadly danger.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy rolled away from its flying razor-sharp hooves. He paused a moment to aim and then shot his right arm upwards. The spiked head of the vulture axe lanced up under the terrified animal’s jaw, entering the brain cleanly. It collapsed warm and limp and shivering on top of them, and its corpse was a protection from the storm of hooves that raged about them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The storm dwindled, passed over, and rumbled away into the distance. In the quiet that followed, Huy rolled towards Lannon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you safe?’ And Lannon crawled with difficulty from under the dead zebra. They dragged themselves from the pit and looked about them with wonder.</p>

  <p class="normal">Across a front of 500 paces, and to a depth of the same distance the ground was covered by a thick carpet of dead and dying game. From their pits amongst this terrible carnage the archers and javelin-throwers climbed and stood staring with the dazed air of drunken men.</p>

  <p class="normal">The line of beaters seemed to wade towards them out of a swamp of hanging dust, even the sky was dulled with the dust, and the pitiful cries and the bleating, of the dying and wounded animals shamed the silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">The beaters came forward in lines through the fields of bleeding flesh and their swords rose and fell as they killed the wounded. Huy reached under his tunic and brought out a leather flask of Zeng wine.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I can always trust you for comfort.’ Lannon grinned, and drank greedily. The wine drops shone like blood in his dusty beard.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Was there ever a hunt like that?’ he asked as he handed the flask to Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy drank and then looked about him at the field. ‘I cannot believe there ever was,’ he said softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will smoke and dry this kill - and then hunt again,’ Lannon promised and strode away to order the butchery.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">A high dome of orange light hung over the plain, light reflected from 10,000 fires. All afternoon and all that night the army worked to butcher the enormous bag. To cut the flesh into strips and hang it on the rocks over the smoking fires. The smell of sweet raw flesh, the musty reek of split entrails, and the sizzle of the cooking meat drifted across the camp where Huy sat beneath the awning of his leather tent and worked by the fluttering light of an oil lamp.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon came out of the darkness, still filthy with dust and dried blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wine! Sunbird, for the love of a friend.’ He pretended to stagger with thirst, and Huy passed both amphora and bowl to him. Scorning the bowl Lannon drank directly from the neck of the jug and wiped his beard on his arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I come with news,’ he grinned. ‘The bag was 1,700 head.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How many of them men?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fifteen men died, and there are some wounded - but was it not worth it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy did not answer, and Lannon went on.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is more news. Another of my javelins has struck the mark. Annel has missed her moon.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The southern air must be beneficial. All four of them with child in two months.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is not the air, Sunbird,’ Lannon laughed and drank again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am pleased,’ said Huy. ‘More of the old blood for Opet.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When did you ever care for blood, Huy Ben-Amon? You are pleased to have more of my brats to spoil - I know you.’ Lannon came to stand behind Huy. ‘You are writing,’ he said, unnecessarily. ‘What is it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A poem,’ said Huy modestly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What of?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The hunt - today’s hunt.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sing it to me,’ commanded Lannon and dropped onto Huy’s fur bed, with the amphora still grasped by the neck.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy fetched his lute, and squatted on the reed mat. He sang, and when he had finished Lannon lay quietly on the bed staring out through the opening of the tent into the night.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I did not see it like that,’ he said at last. ‘To me it was just a taking, a harvest of flesh.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He was silent again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have displeased you?’ Huy asked, and Lannon shook his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you truly believe that what we did today has destroyed something that will never be replaced?’ he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not know, perhaps not - but if we hunted like that every day, or even once every ten days, would we not soon turn this land into a desert?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon brooded quietly over the half-empty amphora for a long while, then he looked up at Huy and smiled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have taken sufficient meat. We will not hunt again this year - only for ivory.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, has the wine jug stuck to your hand?’ Huy asked softly, and Lannon stared at him for a moment then laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A trade, Sunbird, another song and I will give you wine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A fair trade,’ Huy agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the amphora was empty, Huy sent one of his ancient slaves for another.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bring two,’ suggested Lannon. ‘It will save time later.’</p>

  <p class="normal">At midnight Huy was soft from the wine, and desolated by the beauty of his own voice and the sadness of his own song. He wept, and Lannon seeing him weep, wept with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will not have such beauty recorded on the skin of beasts,’ cried Lannon with the tears cutting runnels through the dust on his cheeks and pouring into his beard. ‘I will have a scroll made of the finest gold, and on it you will inscribe your songs, my Sunbird. Then they will live forever to delight my children and my children’s children.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy stopped weeping. The artist in him aroused, his mind quickly assimilating the offer which he knew Lannon would not remember in the morning.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am truly honoured, my lord.’ Huy went to kneel at the side of the bed. ‘Will you sign the treasury order now?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Write it, Huy, write it now, this instant,’ Lannon commanded. ‘I will sign it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And Huy ran for his writing pallet.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal"><a id="gg"></a>The column moved on slowly in a great circle-to the south and east through the southern plains of grass. It was a land of such limitless dimensions that the fifteen-mile column was as significant as a file of safari ants. There were rivers and ranges of hills, forests and plains teeming with game. The only men they met were the garrisons of the king’s hunting camps. Their task was primarily to provide a steady supply of dried meat for the multitudes of slaves that were the foundation of the nation’s prosperity.</p>

  <p class="normal">They crossed the river of the south* six months after departure from the city of Opet and 100 miles beyond they reached the range of thickly forested blue mountains** which marked the border of the southern kingdom.</p>

  <p class="normal">* Limpopo River ** Zoutspansberg</p>

  <p class="normal">They went into camp at the mouth of a dark rocky gorge that tore its way through the heart of the mountains, and Lannon and Huy with a cohort of infantry and archers took the precipitous path through the gorge. It was an eerie place of tall black stone cliffs hanging high above the roaring frothing torrent in the depths below. It was a cold dark place where the warmth of the sun seldom penetrated. Huy shivered, not from the cold, and clutched his axe firmly. He prayed almost continually during the three days that they marched through the mountains for it was most certainly a place frequented by demons.</p>

  <p class="normal">They camped on the southern slopes of the mountains and built signal fires, sending the smoke aloft in tall columns that could be seen for fifty miles. To the southward stretched a land as vast as that to the north.</p>

  <p class="normal">Looking out across its golden rolling grasslands and its dark green forests, Huy felt a sense of awe. ‘I would like to go down into that land,’ he told Lannon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You would be the first,’ Lannon agreed. I wonder what it holds. What treasures, what mysteries?‘</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We know there is a Cape to the far south with a flat-topped mountain where the fleet of Hycanus IX was destroyed, but that is all we know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have a mind to defy the prophecy and lead an expedition southwards beyond these mountains - what say you, Huy?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I would not counsel it, my lord,’ Huy answered formally. ‘No good ever comes of challenging the gods, they have damnably long memories.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I expect you are right,’ Lannon conceded. ‘Yet I am sorely tempted.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy changed a subject which was making him uncomfortable, he should never have broached it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I wonder when they will come.’ He looked up at the smoke from the signal fires streaming up into the calm blue of the midday sky.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They will come when they are ready,’ Lannon shrugged. ‘But I wish they would make it soon. Whilst we wait, we will hunt the leopard.’</p>

  <p class="normal">For ten days they hunted the big spotted cats which abounded in the misty cliffs and woody gorges of the mountains. They hunted with specially trained hounds and lion-spears. They would run the quarry with the pack, until it was cornered or bayed and they would then surround it and close in until the charge was provoked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the man selected by the leopard would take the snarling, slashing animal on the point of his spear. Two of the hunters were killed in those ten days - and one of them was a grandson of Asmun. the old nobleman. He was a fine brave lad and they all mourned, although it was a good and honourable death. They cremated his body, tor he had died in the field, and Huy sacrificed for a safe passage of his soul to the sun.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the eleventh day, in the dawn after Huy had greeted Baal, and they had breakfasted and were dressing and arming for the hunt, Huy noticed the agitation and restlessness of the little bushman huntmaster, Xhai.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it that troubles you, Xhai?’ he asked him in his own language, which he now spoke with authority.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My people are here,’ the bushman told him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How do you know that?’ Huy demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know it!’ Xhai answered simply, and Huy hurried through the camp to Lannon’s tent.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They have come, my lord,’ he told him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good.’ Lannon laid aside his lion-spear and began stripping his hunting armour. ‘Call the stone-finders.’ And the royal geologists and metallurgists came hurrying to the summons.</p>

  <p class="normal">The meeting place was at the foot of the mountains where thick forest ended abruptly at the edge of a wide glade.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon led his party down amongst the rocks and at the edge of the glade they halted, and threw out a protective screen of archers. In the centre of the glade, well out of arrow-shot of the forest edge or the rocky slope, a pole had been driven into the soft earth and the tail of a reed buck dangled from it like a standard. It was the sign that the trade could begin.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon nodded to his senior path-finder, Aziru, and Rib-Addi, master of the royal treasury. The two of them walked out into the glade unarmed and with two slaves following them. The slaves each carried a leather bag.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the foot of the pole was a dried gourd which contained a handful of bright pebbles and stones of various colours ranging from glassy to fiery red.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two officials examined each stone, rejecting some by dropping them in a neat pile on the earth, selecting others by returning them to the gourd. Then from the leather bags they doled out glass beads into a pottery jar which they placed beside the gourd. They withdrew to the rocky slope where Lannon and his archers stood.</p>

  <p class="normal">The waited until a dozen tiny figures left the edge of the forest and approached the pole. The troop of little bushmen squatted beside the gourd and jar and there was a long heated debate before they withdrew to the forest once more. The two officials went out into the glade and found gourd and jar untouched. The offer had been refused. They added a dozen iron arrow-heads to the offering.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the third attempt a bargain was struck when the bushmen accepted the beads and arrow-heads and copper bangles, leaving the stones to be collected.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then another batch of stones was set out beside the pole and haggled over. It was a tedious business which occupied four whole days, and while they waited Huy added considerably to his knowledge of geology.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘From where do these sun stones come?’ he asked Aziru, as he examined a yellow diamond the size of an acorn which had been traded for a pound’s weight of glass beads.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When sun and moon show together in the sky, then it may happen that their rays mingle and become hot and heavy. They fall to earth, and if they strike water then they are quenched and freeze into one of these sun stones.’ Huy found this explanation utterly convincing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A love-drop of Baal and Astarte,’ he whispered with reverence. ‘No wonder then that they are so beautiful.’ He looked up at Aziru. ‘Where do the pygmies find them?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is said that they search in the gravel beds of the rivers, and also the edge of the lakes,’ Aziru explained. ‘But they are not adept at recognizing the true sun stone and their offerings contain many common stones.’</p>

  <p class="normal">When the bushmen had traded their entire gathering of diamonds, they offered for sale the unwanted children of the tribe. These little yellow mites were left bound and shivering with terror beside the trading pole. The slave masters, experts in appraising human flesh, went out to examine them and offer payment. The pygmies were much in demand as slaves, for they were tractable, loyal and hardy. They made excellent hunters, guides, entertainers, and, strangely, children’s companions.</p>

  <p class="normal">Xhai stood behind his tall yellow-haired king and watched the trade, exactly the bargaining which had been conducted over him as a child.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the end of the fourth day the treasury of Opet had acquired five large pottery jars of fine diamonds. Trade in these stones was a jealously guarded monopoly of the ruling house of Barca. In addition there were eighty-six bushman children between the ages of five and fifteen years. They were wild slaves, and had to be bound until tamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy devoted himself almost entirely to their welfare during the return across the mountains. With the help of Xhai and the other tame bushmen he was able to save most of them. Only a dozen of the tiny creatures died of terror and heartbreak before they could be handed over to the slave women of the main camp.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon broke the camp under the southern mountains and they turned north and east, recrossing the river and picking up the mountains of Bar-Zeng* on the horizon. They began passing through the populous kingdom of the east, where the Yuye peasants farmed the corn lands along the Lion River**.</p>

  <p class="normal">* The Chimanimani Mountains **The Sabi River</p>

  <p class="normal">At each settlement the freedmen turned out to welcome them, and make tribute to their new king. They were a cheerful throng, and the mud-walled villages were clean and prosperous-looking. Even the slaves in the fields were sleek and well cared for, only a fool would abuse a valuable possession. The slaves were mostly blacks, taken in the north, but amongst them were those of mixed blood, sired by their own masters, or by selected stud slaves. They were unbound, differing little in dress or ornament from their masters.</p>

  <p class="normal">Along their way the legionaries who had completed their military service left their regiments and returned to their villages. Their places in the ranks were filled by the young recruits.</p>

  <p class="normal">They camped each night at one of the walled and fortified garrisons that studded the road to the mountains of Zeng. They were passing now through the fringes of the wide gold belt that ran east and west across the middle kingdom. It was this belt on which the wealth of Opet was based, and the king’s stone-finders had developed an almost supernatural ability to find the enriched reefs in which the gold was hidden. The results of their efforts were numerous mines where the ore was prised from the earth by platoons of black slaves working naked in the narrow stifling stopes. At the surface it was crushed and the powdered rock washed from the grains of native gold in specially designed copper basins.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon paused in his march to inspect many of these works, and Huy was impressed by the ingenuity of the engineers who overcame the problems that the extraction of the ore presented at each separate site.</p>

  <p class="normal">Where the gold-bearing reef was narrow, they kept the headroom in the stopes as low as possible by using only women and children in the workings.</p>

  <p class="normal">They employed elephants for hauling the ore baskets to the surface, and for carrying water to the mines situated in the drier areas.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had developed a method of undermining massive ore bodies and collapsing them under their own weight. It was a dangerous procedure, and at one of the mines practising this method Lannon and Huy were kept from sleep the entire night by the mourning wailing from the slave compound. During the day an ore body had collapsed prematurely and over a hundred slaves with a few slave-masters had been crushed beneath it. Huy wondered how much of that hideous sound was on account of the dead slave-masters.</p>

  <p class="normal">Driven by his insatiable curiosity, Huy had himself lowered in one of the ore baskets to the lower levels of one of the workings. It was a hellish place of foul air, and heat and sweat, lit by the flickering oil lamps. The naked slaves toiled in cramped and dangerous chambers hacked from the living rock. Huy watched an intrusive outcrop of harder rock demolished by the means Hannibal had used hundreds of years before to clear his passage across the alps. A slow fire was lit and kept burning upon the rock until it had heated to a dull glow. It was quenched then with buckets of liquid, a mixture of water and sour wine, that exploded in a swirling cloud of steam, and split the rock into chunks which were hacked out and dragged away by the slaves. Huy went to the face where he saw the native gold shine in the mother lode, rich and yellow, and he mused at the price that must be paid for its extraction.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Huy was again hoisted to the surface he was soaked with sweat, and filthy with dirt from the stopes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon shook his head. ‘What did you want to do that for? Have the birds got your brain, that you must grovel around in the earth?’</p>

  <p class="normal">At one of the mines the ore had been exhausted above the level of the subterranean water. It was impossible to go down below this level, for no method had yet been devised to clear the water from the workings. Bucket chains of slaves were seldom able to lower the level by more than a few inches. The mine must be returned to Astarte the mother of moon and earth. She had given of her bounty, and in return she must receive.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon, as was his right, selected the messengers, conferring with his slave-masters to decide which fifteen slaves would be the least loss to the labour force. The gods were not particular about the quality of the sacrifice. To them a life was a life, and therefore acceptable.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy’s heart went out to them as they were led down into the workings for the last time. They wore the symbolic chains of the sacrifice, and they shuffled along, stooped and maimed and coughing with the lung disease of the miners.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy delegated one of his priests to supervise the sending, and when his emissary emerged from that evil pit Huy led the praise chant to Astarte, and the work of refilling the mine began. It would continue for many weeks because of the amount of rock that must be carefully repacked into the caverns.</p>

  <p class="normal">This refilling was necessary to placate the earth mother further and also to allow new gold to grow.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aziru explained the need for this. ‘This is benevolent ground, suitable for the growth of gold. We replace rock in the earth and the action of the sun upon it will, in time, engender a fresh growth of the precious metal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All life is in Baal,’ Huy intoned formally.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Our children’s children will one day thank us for this seeding of the earth,’ Aziru predicted smugly, and Huy was impressed with this forethought - and he recorded every detail of it all in his neatly flowing script.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Three hundred days after leaving the city of Opet, the column climbed the foothills of the Zeng Mountains.* The air was cool and fresh after the heat of the lowlands, and at night the mist hung heavily along the slopes and woke the fever in men’s bones so that they shivered and huddled in their cloaks about the campfires.</p>

  <p class="normal">* Inyanga Mountains</p>

  <p class="normal">Those hills were the gardens of Opet, where tens of thousands of acres of land had been terraced and cultivated, and where tens of thousands of slaves tended the olive groves and vineyards. The centre and citadel of these gardens was a fortified hilltop town named after the twelfth Gry-Lion of Opet, Zeng-Hanno. Here there were temples to both Baal and Astarte, the religious strongholds of the eastern kingdom, and Huy spent twenty days in synod with his priests and priestesses. Huy also exercised and inspected his own personal legion, the sixth Ben-Amon, which was the only one of the eight legions of Opet composed entirely of warriors of the blood. Their standard was a golden vulture set on a shaft of polished ebony.</p>

  <p class="normal">These religious activities were interrupted when Lannon summoned Huy to accompany him on a short journey to the east, from whence word had come that the Dravs awaited Lannon to renew the five-year treaty.</p>

  <p class="normal">Three sheikhs of the Drav met them when they descended the mountains of <em>Zeng</em> towards the eastern sea. They were tall, brown-skinned men with fierce eagle features and dark glittering eyes. They wore head-dresses of white over their long black hair, and they dressed in full-length robes belted with sashes of filigree and semi-precious stones. Each carried a magnificent broad curved dagger at his waist, and wore slippers with long pointed toes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Their warriors dressed differently, wearing baggy pantaloons, on their heads onion-shaped helmets, body armour of silver breastplates; and they were armed with round iron shields and long curved scimitars, spears and short oriental bows. Most of them were Negroes, but they had clearly adopted the Drav manner of speech and dress. Two hundred years of relentless warfare had preceded the treaty between the Drav and the kings of Opet.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two armies bivouacked on each side of a wide valley, with a stream of clear water overhung with shady green trees separating the camps.</p>

  <p class="normal">Under these trees the council tents were pitched, and here for five days the two delegations feasted and bargained and manoeuvred diplomatically.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy spoke the language of the Dravs and he translated tor Lannon the negotiations towards a treaty of unrestricted trade and mutual military aid.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord, Prince Hassan is concerned to know how many warriors Opet could put into the field in the event of a threat to the security of the two nations.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They sat on piles of silken cushions and lovely woven woollen rugs of vivid design and colour, drinking sherbet, for the Drav would not touch even the finest wines, eating a dish of mutton and fish spiced with herbs, smiling at each other and not trusting each other farther than the range of the eye.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Prince Hassan,’ replied Lannon, nodding and smiling at him, ‘is concerned to know with what force we would oppose an attempt to seize the gardens of Zeng and the gold mines of the middle kingdom.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Of course,’ Huy agreed. ‘What shall I tell him?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell him I can field fourteen regular legions, as many auxiliaries, and 400 elephants.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He will not believe those figures, my lord.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Of course not, no more do I believe his. Tell him anyway.’ And so the bargaining proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual trust.</p>

  <p class="normal">They agreed to secure each other’s flanks, combine to hold the line of the great river in the north against invasion by the migrant black tribes, and to come to each other’s assistance if that border was violated.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The prince would like to revolve the unit of trade, my lord. He suggests that 500 mikthals should equal one Opet finger of gold.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell him politely to swing on his own testicles,’ Lannon replied, smiling at the prince, and the prince nodded and smiled back at him, the gem stones sparkling and glittering on his fingers.</p>

  <p class="normal">They set the rate of exchange at 590 mikthals per finger, and went on to negotiate the slaving agreement, and the cotton and silk clauses. On the fifth day they ate salt together and exchanged extravagant gifts, while the armies gave displays of archery and swordsmanship and drill. These were intended to impress the other side.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Their archers are ineffectual,’ Lannon appraised them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The bow is too short, and they draw to the waist not the chin,’ Huy agreed. ‘They limit their range and accuracy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Then later when the infantry drilled:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Their infantry are lighter armed and armoured, my lord. They have no axemen, and I doubt those breastplates would turn an arrow.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And yet they move fast, and they have a fiery spirit - do not dismiss them lightly, my Sunbird.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, my lord. I will not do that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The elephants charged across the open ground with the archers in their castles spraying a shower of arrows ahead of the line. The huge grey beasts tossed and trampled the lines of straw dummies and their squeals and trumpets rang against the crest of the hills.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘See their faces,’ Lannon murmured. ‘The prince seems to be looking on the eternal seas!’ And it was true that the Dravs were silent and subdued for they had no elephants of their own, they had not mastered the art of training them.</p>

  <p class="normal">They parted and when Lannon and Huy looked back into the valley they saw the Drav army winding away eastwards in column, with the sunlight sparkling on helmets and spearheads.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Our eastern border is secure for five more years,’ Lannon declared with satisfaction.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Or until the princes change their minds,’ Huy qualified.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Sunbird. They must honour the treaty - it is in their own best interest. Trust me, old friend.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You, I trust,’ said Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">On the return to Zeng-Hanno the legions assembled and preparations began for the burning which Lannon planned to lead across the great river.</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy’s legion was one of those chosen, and he spent much time with his priest-officers. They dined with him in the splendid quarters set aside for him within the enclosure of the temple of Baal. Huy invited the reverend priestesses of Astarte, and provided magnificent fare for he had hunted the day before and there was game to add to the beef and chicken and fish seasoned with spices traded from the Drav, while the gardens of Zeng provided the best of their fruits and wines.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon was the guest of honour, and they were all decked with wreaths of flowers and boisterous with wine.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Reverend Mother,’ one of Huy’s priests, a handsome young rake named Bakmor, called across the board to the High Priestess of Astarte. ‘Is it true that you have discovered a new oracle among your novices to replace the Lady Imilce who died two years ago of the shivering sickness?’</p>

  <p class="normal">The reverend mother turned wise old eyes on the young officer. She had pale, brittle-looking skin and her hair was fine and fluffy white. Her arms were thin and pale also and her hands skeletal and corded with blue veins. Up until now she had sat withdrawn from the revelry.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is true that one of the temple novices shows wisdom and wit beyond her years or training, it is true also that she has seen beyond the veil and made prophecy, but the sisterhood has not yet decided to send her to the High Priest for examination.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is there doubt then, Reverend Mother?’ Bakmor insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There is always doubt, my son,’ the priestess answered, in a tone that clearly rebuked his presumption and the youngster sat back discomforted.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have not heard of this,’ Huy remarked with interest and a trace of accusation in his tone. For two years the priesthood had been without the services of an oracle, and the search had been diligent. Fees for divination and prophecy formed a significant proportion of the temple income, and there were also political reasons why Huy was anxious to find a successor to Lady Imilce.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Forgive me, Holy Father. I had determined to discuss this with you privately,’ the High Priestess spoke confidentially, but Lannon leaned across Huy to join the discussion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Send for the wench,’ he said, speaking thickly with wine. The priestess stiffened at his choice of words. ‘Send for her, let her entertain us with her prophecies.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My lord,’ Huy wished to remonstrate but Lannon brushed his protest aside, and raised his voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Send for the oracle - let her speak on the outcome of the campaign to the north.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy turned back to the priestess with an apology in his eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The king commands,’ he said, and the priestess inclined her head then turned to whisper to her body slave. The slave hurried from the hall.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she came the loud voices and laughter stilled, and they stared at her with curiosity. She was a tall girl with finely boned wrists and ankles. She wore the long green robes of the temple novice which left her arms bare, and her skin had a lustre and smoothness which made it glow in the lamp light. Her hair was dark and soft, so that it floated cloudlike to her shoulders. She wore the gold crescent moon emblem of Astarte on her deep bulging forehead, dangling from a fine chain of gold, and her earrings were two small sun stones that shone like the stars of heaven.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her eyes were green, a colour that reminded Huy of the pool of Astarte in the cavern of the temple of Opet. Her lips were full and quivered faintly, betraying her agitation at his unexpected summons, while there were spots of colour in her cheeks. However, her manner was calm and controlled, and she moved with dignity to where Huy sat. He saw then that she was very young.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Pray for me, Holy Father,’ she greeted him and bowed her head. Huy studied her avidly, taken with her direct manner and her dignity.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Greet your king, my child,’ he murmured and the girl turned to Lannon. While she made the formal greeting Huy continued to examine her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is your name? he asked, and the girl turned back to Huy and fixed him with those solemn green eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tanith,’ she answered. It was the ancient name of the goddess, from the days of the old city of Carthage.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is a pretty name,’ Huy nodded. ‘I have always loved it.’ And the girl smiled at him. It was a smile that took him by surprise, for it was as warm and uplifting as the dawn of Baal.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are kind, Holy Father,’ she said, smiling at him and Huy Ben-Amon fell in love. He felt the bottom fall out of his stomach, and his vitals sucked downwards in a long sliding sensation. He stared at Tanith, unable to speak, feeling his cheeks flush with hot blood, searching desperately for the right word but not finding it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon broke the spell by shouting at a slave, ‘Bring a cushion.’ And they seated Tanith before the king and priests.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Make an oracle,’ Lannon commanded, and leaned towards her, breathing heavily and with the wine flushing his face. Tanith looked at him calmly with the faintest trace of a smile on her lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If it were within my power, I would speak an oracle for you, lord, but then there would be a matter of fee and question.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is the fee?’ Lannon demanded, he had flushed a little darker with the first stirring of anger. He was not accustomed to this treatment.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Holy Father, would you set the fee?’ Tanith asked of Huy and the devil took Huy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘One hundred fingers of fine gold,’ he spoke before he realized what he had done. It was an enormous fee, and it constituted a challenge to Lannon, daring him to back down or pay. Tanith smiled again now, a provocative dimple appeared in her cheek and she held Lannon’s scowl with a cool amused stare. Huy was suddenly aware that he had placed the girl in a position of peril. Lannon would not forgive this readily, and Huy hastened to give Lannon a graceful escape.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For this fee the Gry-Lion may put as many questions as he has fingers on his sword hand.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon hesitated, Huy could see that he was still angry but slightly placated by Huy’s amendment.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I doubt that the wisdom of a child will be worth that much, but it amuses me to test this wench,’ Lannon mumbled, looking anything but amused. He took up his wine bowl and drank deeply, then he wiped his beard and looked at Tanith.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I go northwards on a mission. Speak to me of the outcome,’ he ordered, and Tanith settled herself on the leather cushion, spreading her green robe about her. She lowered her head slightly, and her green eyes seemed to look inwards. There was an expectant hush on the guests now, and they watched her eagerly. Huy noticed that her cheeks paled, and her lips also rimmed with white.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There will be a mighty harvest,’ Tanith whispered hoarsely in a strange unnatural monotone, ‘more than the Gry-Lion expects or realizes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The guests stirred, glancing at each other, whispering, pondering the answer. Lannon frowned over the girl’s words.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you speak of a harvest of death?’ Lannon asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You will take death with you, but death will return with you unknown and secretly,’ Tanith replied. It was an unfavourable oracle, the young officers were restless, sobering rapidly. Huy wanted to intervene - he was regretting the whole business. He knew his king, knew he would not readily forget or forgive.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What must I fear?’ Lannon asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Blackness,’ Tanith answered readily.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How will I find death?’ Lannon was shaking with anger now, his voice guttural and his pale blue eyes deadly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘At the hand of a friend.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who will reign in Opet after me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He who kills the gry-lion,’ Tanith replied, and Lannon struck the wine bowl aside and it shattered on the earthen floor, the red wine splattering the feet of a waiting slave.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The gry-lion is finished,’ he shouted. ‘I killed the last of them - do you dare prophesy the death of house Barca?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That is your sixth question, my lord.’ Tanith looked up. ‘1 cannot see the answer to it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get her out of here,’ Lannon roared. ‘Take the witch away.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And Huy signalled quickly for the High Priestess to take her, for a slave to replace Lannon’s wine bowl, and for another to fetch his lute. After Huy’s third song Lannon laughed again.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">On the eve of the departure of the legions from Zeng-Hanno, Huy sent for the priestess and the novice Tanith. It was five days since her disastrous prophecies to Lannon Hycanus, and it had taken all Huy’s strength of will not to send for her earlier.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she came she was fresher and lovelier than he remembered. While the priestess sat in the shade, Huy walked with Tanith upon the walls of the city, looking down on the one hand upon the streets and courtyards with the bustle of the army preparing for its march, while on the other hand they looked across the wooded hills and terraces where the slaves tended the neatly laid out vineyards and orchards.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have instructed the reverend mother that you will join the convoy to Opet through the middle kingdom. You will travel with the wives of the king, and at Opet you will enter the sisterhood of Astarte - and await my return.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, my lord.’ Her humble tone was at odds with her saucy expression. Huy stopped and looked into her green eyes, she held his gaze easily, smiling a little.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you truly possess the sight, Tanith?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not know, my lord.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The words you spoke to the king, what did they mean?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do not know. They are words that came into my mind unbidden. 1 cannot explain them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy nodded, and paced on in silence. There was an appealing innocence about this girl, coupled with a bright mind and a sunny disposition it was impossible to resist. Huy stopped again, and she waited for him to speak.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you love the gods, Tanith?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you believe that I am their appointed one?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do, Holy Father,’ she answered with such conviction, with such transparent honesty and respect, that Huy’s reservations were set at rest. There was no doubt that she was an instrument which could be used, as long as it was used with skill.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is your destiny, Tanith?’ he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I cannot see it,’ she answered, but she hesitated then and for the first time Huy knew she was uncertain. ‘But this I know, that this - this meeting between you and me is part of that destiny.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Huy felt his heart swell, but his voice was gruff as he replied. ‘Caution, child. You are a priestess, dedicated to the goddess. You know better than to speak like that to a man.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Tanith dropped her eyes and colour stained her skin a dusky rose. The soft wing of dark hair swung forward against her cheek, and she pushed it away with her hand. Huy felt his soul shrivel with despair. Her presence was a physical agony, for no matter how great his need of her it could never be slaked. She belonged to the gods, forbidden, untouchable.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know that,’ Huy warned her sternly. ‘Do not trifle with the gods.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She looked up at him demurely, but Huy could have sworn there were glints of laughter and teasing mockery in the green eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Holiness, you wrong me. I did not mean as man and maid.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How then?’ demanded Huy, disappointed and with a hollow feeling in his guts at the denial.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will find the answer to that when we meet at Opet, Holiness,’ she murmured and Huy knew that the months until then would pass slowly.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon stood over a clay box in which was modelled a relief map of the great river area. In the east rose the Clouds of Baal, a mighty waterfall where the river fell hundreds of feet into a dark gorge and the spray from the torrent rose high into the heavens, a perpetual cloud that stood upon the plains.* From here the river flowed into a deep valley, a hot unhealthy place where rough and rocky ramparts rose on each bank, heavily forested and rich with the ivory-bearing herds. Six hundred miles farther east the river entered the territory of the Dravs, and ran through a wide alluvial plain which was inundated in the season of rain. Then at last the river joined the eastern sea through a dozen fan-shaped mouths.</p>

  <p class="normal">* Victoria F<em>alls</em></p>

  <p class="normal">Lannon pointed out the main features of this country on the model to his generals, occasionally turning for verification to his garrison commanders who had held the river during the past year. There were twenty men in the large leather tent, and the sides were lifted to allow a dry breeze to enter - and to show the view across the wide valley below the camp. The great river itself was obscured by the tall dark green growth of trees along its bank. There was an occasional flash of reflected sunlight from the water amongst the trees. Far to the north the opposite escarpment of the valley rose in smoky blue tiers of hills.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Our spies have marked the main towns at which the tribes are gathered. They are mostly on the high ground, a day’s march beyond the river, and it is important that each tribe be attacked on the same day.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He went on to assign a target to each of his commanders, a crossing place over the river, and a return route.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There will be no danger of attack on the return march, as long as you break their spirit on the first day. Each of the tribes is at war with the others, and they will not rally to the assistance of each other. The only way in which we can fail is if warning is carried to the barbarians and they scatter before our thrust.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He explained the plan in detail, dwelling on the logistics of supply and routes of march, until at last Lannon set a date for the attack.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Twelve days from now. That will give each of your legions time to march to the crossing places, and reach the towns of the barbarians.’</p>

  <p class="normal">From the camp on the escarpment of the valley, Huy marched the Sixth Ben-Amon to the garrison fort on the banks of the great river at Sett, and here he put the legion into camp in a forest of mopane trees which would screen them from observers on the opposite bank. Fires were forbidden during the day and were carefully screened at night and the men were kept busy building the rafts for the crossing. Heavy rains in the west had swollen the river and the ford was impassable.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mago Tellema, the garrison commander, was a tall balding disillusioned man with the yellowish skin and eyes of the shivering sickness which was endemic along the river. He seemed pathetically glad of Huy’s company during the waiting days, and Huy found his information valuable, so they dined together every evening - Huy provided the wine out of the ample stocks he had brought from Zeng.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have kept my patrols on their usual routine, as you ordered.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good,’ Huy nodded over a bowl of baked river fish and wild rice. ‘Have they noticed any increase in activity since my arrival?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Holiness. A war party of a few hundred crossed last night and attacked one of my outposts. We drove them off readily enough, killing fifty of them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do they gain by these raids?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Weapons, and an appraisal of our strength.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is the whole border so active?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Holy Father. But here at Sett we oppose one of the more warlike tribes, the Vendi - they are exceptional. You recall how four years ago they crossed in strength, 20,000 of them overwhelmed the garrison here and left the valley—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ Huy interrupted. ‘I was with the legions when we met them at Bhor.’</p>
