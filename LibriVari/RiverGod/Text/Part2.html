    <p class="Chap">THE FESTIVAL ENDED IN THE TEMPLE OF the god. It seemed once more that all the populace of Greater Thebes was packed into the courtyards. We were jammed so tightly that I could scarcely breathe in the press and the heat.</p>

    <p>I was feeling wretched, for I had slept little for two nights in succession on account of the worry and the strain. Apart from the uncertainty of the fate of Tanus, I had been further burdened by my Lord Intef with the onerous duty of arranging the wedding ceremony of the king to his daughter, a duty that ran so contrary to my own desires. Added to which, I was parted from my mistress, and I could scarcely bear it. I do not know how I came through it. Even the slave boys were concerned about me. They declared that they had never seen my beauty so impaired, or my spirits so low.</p>

    <p>Twice during Pharaoh’s interminable speech from the throne, I found myself swaying on my feet, on the very point of fainting. However, I forced myself to hold on, while the king droned out the platitudes and half-truths with which he sought to disguise the true state of the kingdom and to placate the populace.</p>

    <p>As was only to be expected, he never referred directly to the red pharaoh in the north or the civil war in which we were embroiled, except in such broad terms as ‘these troubled times’ or ‘the defection and insurrection’. However, after he had spoken for a while it suddenly became plain to me that he was referring to every one of the issues that Tanus had raised in his Reclamation, and attempting to find remedies for each of them.</p>

    <p>It was true that he was doing so in his usual inept and vacillating fashion, but the simple fact that he had taken notice of what Tanus had said braced me and focused my wandering attention. I edged forward in the press of humanity until I had a better view of the throne, by which time the king was speaking about the impudence of the slaves and the disrespectful behaviour of the lower classes of our society. This was another issue that Tanus had mentioned, and I was amused to hear Pharaoh’s solution. ‘From henceforth the slave-owner may order fifty lashes to the insolent slave, without recourse to the magistrate to sanction such punishment,’ he announced.</p>

    <p>I smiled when I remembered how this same king had almost wrecked the state twelve years previously with another proclamation that ran in the exact opposite direction to this latest pronouncement. Still idealistic at his coronation, he had set out actually to abolish the ancient and honourable institution of slavery. He had wanted to turn every slave in Egypt loose and make him a free man.</p>

    <p>Even at this remove in time, such folly is still incomprehensible to me. Though I am myself a slave, I believe that slavery and serfdom are the institutions on which the greatness of nations is founded. The rabble cannot govern itself. Government should be entrusted only to those born and trained to it. Freedom is a privilege, not a right. The masses need a strong master, for without control and direction anarchy would reign. The absolute monarch and slavery and serfdom are the pillars of a system that has allowed us to develop into civilized men.</p>

    <p>It had been instructive to see how the slaves themselves had rebelled at the prospect of having freedom thrust upon them. I had been very young at the time, but I too had been alarmed at the prospect of being turned out from my warm and secure niche in the lioys’ quarters to scavenge on the rubbish-heaps for my next crust of bread with a horde of other freed slaves. A bad master is better than no master at all.</p>

    <p>Of course, the kingdom had been thrown into chaos by this folly. The army had been upon the brink of revolt. Had the red pharaoh in the north seized the opportunity, then history might have been written differently. In the end our own pharaoh had hastily withdrawn his misguided decree of manumission, and managed to cling to his throne. Now here he was little more than a decade later proclaiming increased punishments for the impudence of a slave. It was so typical of this hesitant and muddling pharaoh that I pretended to mop my brow in order to cover the first smile that had creased my face in the last two days.</p>

    <p>‘The practice of self-mutilation for the purpose of avoiding military service will in future be strongly discouraged,’ the king droned on. ‘Any eligible young man claiming exemption under this dispensation is to appear before a tribunal of three army officers, at least one of whom is to be a centurion or officer of superior rank.’ This time my smile was one of reluctant approval. For once Pharaoh was on the right tack. I would dearly love to see Menset and Sobek displaying their missing thumbs to some hardened old veteran of the river wars. What tender sympathy they could expect! ‘The fine for such an offence will be one thousand rings of gold.’ By Seth’s bulging belly, that would make those two young dandies pause, and my Lord Intef would have to meet the fine on their behalf.</p>

    <p>Despite my other concerns, I was beginning to feel a little more cheerful, as Pharaoh continued, ‘From this day forward it will be an offence punishable by a fine of ten gold rings for a harlot to ply for trade in any public place, other than one set aside by the magistrates for that purpose.’ This time I could barely prevent myself from laughing aloud. Vicariously Tanus would make puritans and honest men of all of Thebes. I wondered how the sailors and the off-duty soldiers would welcome this interference in their sporting lives. Pharaoh’s period of lucidity had been short-lived. Any fool knows the folly of trying to legislate to man’s sexual foibles.</p>

    <p>Despite my doubts as to the wisdom of the king’s remedies, still I found myself overtaken by a tremulous excitement. It was clear that the king had taken serious notice of every issue that Tanus had brought forward in his declamation. Could he now go on to condemn Tanus for sedition? I wondered.</p>

    <p>However, Pharaoh had not finished yet. ‘It has been brought to my notice that certain officials of the state have abused the trust and faith that I have placed in them. These officials, concerned with the collection of taxes and the handling of public funds, will be called upon to account for the monies placed in their care. Those found guilty of embezzlement and corruption will be summarily sentenced to death by strangulation.’ The populace stirred and sighed with disbelief. Would the king truly seek to restrain his tax-collectors?</p>

    <p>Then a single voice at the back of the hall cried out, ‘Pharaoh is great! Long live Pharaoh!’ The cry was taken up until the temple rang with the cheering. It must have been an unusual sound for the king to hear, that spontaneous applause. Even at the distance that I was from the throne I could tell that he enjoyed it. His lugubrious expression lightened and the double crown seemed to weigh less heavily on his head. I was certain that all of this must improve Tanus’ chances of escaping the executioner’s noose.</p>

    <p>When the cheering eventually subsided, the king went on in his particular style to diminish everything that he had just achieved. ‘My trusted grand vizier, the noble Lord Intef, will be placed in sole and absolute charge of this investigation of the civil service, with the full powers of search and arrest, of life and of death vested in him.’ There was just the softest echo of applause to greet this appointment, and I used it to disguise a sardonic chuckle. Pharaoh was sending a hungry leopard to count the birds in his chicken-coop. What sport my Lord Intef would have amongst the royal treasuries, and what a redistribution of the nation’s wealth would now take place with my master doing the counting, and milking the tax-collectors of their secret hoards of savings!</p>

    <p>Pharaoh had a rare talent for capsizing or running the noblest sentiments and intentions on to the rocks with his blundering helmsmanship. I wondered what other folly he would manage to perpetrate before he finished speaking that day, and I did not have too long to wait.</p>

    <p>‘For some time it has been a cause for great concern to me that a state of lawlessness exists in the Upper Kingdom, placing the lives and the estates of honest citizens in the gravest jeopardy. I had made dispositions to deal with this state of affairs at an appropriate time. However, the matter was recently presented to me in such an untimely and ill-advised manner as to reek of sedition. It was done under the dispensation of the festival of Osiris. However, that dispensation does not cover treason or the crime of blasphemy, an attack on the person and divinity of the king.’ Pharaoh paused significantly. It was clear that he was speaking of Tanus, and I was once again critical of his judgement. A strong pharaoh would not explain his motives to the people, or seek to win their approval for his actions. He would simply have ,pronounced sentence and have had done with the matter.</p>

    <p>‘I speak, of course, of Tanus, Lord Harrab, who played the role of the great god Horus at the pageant of Osiris. He has been arrested for the crime of sedition. My councillors are divided on the subject of this person’s guilt. There are those amongst them who wish him to pay the supreme penalty?’ I saw my Lord Intef, standing below the throne, avert his gaze for a moment, and it confirmed what I already knew, that he was the chief amongst those who wished to see Tanus executed ‘?and there are those who feel that his declamation at the festival was indeed inspired by divine forces and that it was not the voice of Tanus, Lord Harrab, that spoke out on these matters, but the veritable voice of the god Horus. If this latter be the case, then clearly there can be no culpability to the mortal through whom the god chose to speak.’</p>

    <p>The reasoning was fair, but what pharaoh worth the double crown would deign to explain it to this horde of common soldiers and sailors and farmers, of tradesmen and labourers and slaves, most of whom were still suffering from the ill-effects of too much wine and revelry? While I still pondered this, the king gave a command to the captain of his bodyguard who stood below the throne. I recognized him as Neter, the officer who had been sent to arrest Tanus. Neter marched away smartly and returned a moment later, leading Tanus from the sanctuary at the rear of the hall.</p>

    <p>My heart leaped at the sight of my friend, and then with joy and hope I realized that he was unbound, there were no chains on his ankles. Although he carried no weapons and wore no badge of rank, and was dressed in a simple white kilt, he walked with his accustomed elastic step and jaunty grace. Apart from the,healing scab on his forehead where Rasfer had struck him, he was unmarked. He had not been beaten or tortured, and I felt my optimism revived. They were not treating him as a condemned man.</p>

    <p>A moment later all my hopes were dashed to pieces. Tanus made his obeisance before the throne, but when he rose to his feet again, Pharaoh looked down upon him severely and spoke in a voice without pity. ‘Tanus, Lord Harrab, you stand accused of treason and sedition. I find you guilty of both these crimes. I sentence you to death by strangulation, the traditional punishment of the traitor.’</p>

    <p>As Neter placed the noose of linen rope around Tanus’ neck to mark him as one condemned to die, a groan went up from the people who watched. A woman wailed, and soon the temple was filled with cries of lamentation and the ululation of mourning. Never before had such a display accompanied the passing of die death sentence. Nothing could demonstrate more clearly the love which the populace bore Tanus. I wailed with them and the tears broke from my lids and streamed down my face to pour like a waterfall on to my chest.</p>

    <p>The bodyguards fell upon the crowd, using the butts of their long spears in an attempt to beat the mourners into silence. It was in vain, and I screamed out over their heads, ‘Mercy, bountiful Pharaoh! Mercy for the noble Tanus!’</p>

    <p>One of the guards struck me on the side of the head, and I fell to the ground half-stunned, but my cry was taken up. ‘Mercy, we beseech you, oh divine Mamose!’ It took all the efforts of the guards to restore some order, but still a few of the women were sobbing.</p>

    <p>Only when Pharaoh raised his voice again were we at last silent, so that every one-of us heard his next pronouncement. “The condemned man has complained of the lawless state of the kingdom. He has called upon the throne to stamp out the bands of robbers who ravage the land. The condemned man has been called a hero, and there are those who say that he is a mighty warrior. If this be true, then he himself would be better suited than any other to carry out those measures he demands.’</p>

    <p>Now the people were confused and silent, and I struck the tears from my face with my forearm as I strained to catch the next word. ‘Therefore, the sentence of death is deferred for two years. If the condemned man was truly inspired by the god Horus when he made his seditious speech, then the god will assist him in the task I now place upon him.’</p>

    <p>The silence was profound. None of us seemed able to understand what we were hearing, although hope and despair filled my soul in equal measure.</p>

    <p>At a signal from the king one of the ministers of the crown stepped forward and offered Pharaoh a tray on which lay a tiny blue statuette. Pharaoh held it aloft and announced, ‘I issue to Lord Harrab the hawk seal of the pharaohs. Under the auspice of the seal he may recruit all the men and materials of war that he deems necessary to his task. He may employ whatever means he chooses, and no man may prevent him. For two full years he is the king’s man, and he answers only to the king. At the end of that time, on the last day of the next festival of Osiris, he will come before the throne once again, wearing the noose of death around his neck. If he has failed in his task, the noose will be tightened and he will be strangled to death on the spot where he now stands. If he has completed his task, then I, Pharaoh Mamose, will lift the noose from around his neck with my own hands and replace it with a chain of gold.’</p>

    <p>Still none of us could speak or move, and we stared in fascination as Pharaoh made a gesture with the crook and the flail. ‘Tanus, Lord Harrab, I charge you with the task of eradicating from the Upper Kingdom of Egypt the outlaws and robber bands that are terrorizing this land. Within two years you will restore order and peace to the Upper Kingdom. Fail me at your peril.’</p>

    <p>A roar went up from the congregation, wild as the sound of storm surf beating on a rocky shore. Though they cheered unthinkingly, I lamented. The task that Pharaoh had set was too great for any mortal man to achieve. The cloud of death had not been lifted from over Tanus. I knew that in two years from today he would die on the very same spot where he now stood so young and proud and tall.</p>

    <p class="Chap">FORLORN AS A LOST WAIF, SHE STOOD alone in the midst of the multitude, with the river that was her patron god at her back and before her a sea of faces.</p>

    <p>The long linen shift that fell to her ankles was dyed with the juice of shellfish to the colour of the finest wine, a colour that proclaimed her as a virgin bride. Her hair was loose. It flowed down on to her shoulders in a soft dark tide that shone in the sunlight as though with an inner fire. On those shining locks she wore the bridal wreath woven from the long stems of the water-lily. The blossoms were an unearthly cerulean blue, with throats of the clearest gold.</p>

    <p>Her face was as white as freshly ground cornflour. Her eyes were so large and dark that they reminded me heart-breakingly of the little girl whom, in years gone by, I had so often woken from the grip of nightmare, and lit the lamp and sat beside her cot until she slept again. This time I could not help her, for the nightmare was reality.</p>

    <p>I could not go to her, for the priests and Pharaoh’s guard surrounded her, as they had all these days past, and they would not let me near unto her. She was lost to me for ever, my little girl, and I could not support the thought of it.</p>

    <p>The priests had built the wedding canopy of river rushes on the bank above the Nile, and my Lady Lostris waited beneath it for her bridegroom to come to claim her. At her side stood her father, with the Gold of Praise glittering around his neck and the smile of the cobra on his lips.</p>

    <p>The royal bridegroom came at last, to the solemn beat of the drum and the bleat of gazelle-horn trumpets, and to me this wedding march was” die saddest sound in all the earth.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh wore the nemes crown and carried the sceptre, but behind the pomp and the regalia, he was still a little old man with a pot-belly and a sad face. I could not help but think of the other bridegroom who might have stood under the canopy beside my mistress, if only the gods had been kinder.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh’s ministers and high officials attended him so closely that my view of my mistress was obscured. Despite the fact that it was I who had been forced to arrange every detail of it, I was excluded from the wedding, and I had only glimpses of my Lady Lostris during the ceremony.</p>

    <p>The high priest of Osiris washed the hands and the feet of both the bride and the groom with water freshly drawn from the Nile to symbolize the purity of their union. Then the king broke a morsel from the ritual corn-loaf and offered it to his young bride as a pledge. I glimpsed my mistress’s face as he placed the crust between her lips. She could neither chew nor swallow but stood with it ia her mouth as though it were a stone.</p>

    <p>Once again she was hidden from my view, and it was only when I heard the crunch of the empty jug that had contained the marriage wine as the bridegroom shattered it with a blow of his sword, that I knew that it was done and that Lostris was for ever more beyond the reach of Tanus’ arms.</p>

    <p>The crowd beneath the canopy opened and Pharaoh led his newest bride forward to the front of the platform to present her to the people. They showed their love for Lostris in a chorus of adulation that went on and on until my ears rang and my head swam.</p>

    <p>I wanted to escape from the press and go to find Tanus. Although I knew that he had been released from detention and was once again at liberty, he had not attended the ceremony. He was perhaps the only man in Thebes who had not come to the riverside today. I knew that wherever he might be, he stood in as dire need of me as I was of him. The only small comfort that either of us might find on this tragic day was with each other. However, I could not tear myself away. I had to see it out to the final harrowing moment.</p>

    <p>At last my Lord Intef came forward to take his farewell of his daughter. As the crowd subsided into silence he embraced her.</p>

    <p>Lostris was like a corpse in his embrace. Her arms hung limply at her side, and her face was pale as death. Her father released her, but kept a grip on her hand as he turned and faced the congregation to offer the ritual gift to his daughter. Traditionally, this gift was made over and above the dowry that went directly to the bridegroom. However, only the nobility observed this custom, which was designed to give the bride an independent income.</p>

    <p>‘Now that you go from my house and from my protection to the house of your husband, I bestow upon you the gift of parting, that you will remember me always as the father that loved you.’ The words were inappropriate to the circumstances, I thought bitterly. My Lord Intef had never loved another living soul. However, he continued the ancient formula, as though the sentiments were his own. ‘Ask any boon of me, my beloved child. I will refuse you nothing on this joyous day.’</p>

    <p>It was the usual practice for the extent of the gift to be agreed in private between father and daughter before the ceremony, hi this case, however, my Lord Intef had told his daughter unequivocally what she was entitled to ask for. He had done me the honour of discussing the matter with me the previous day, before .informing Lostris of his decision. ‘I don’t want to be extravagant, but on the other hand I do not wish to appear parsimonious in Pharaoh’s eyes,’ he had mused. ‘Let us say, five thousand gold rings and fifty feddan of land?not on the riverfront, mind you.’</p>

    <p>He had, with my prompting, finally decided on five thousand gold rings and one hundred feddan of prime irrigable land as being a suitable gift for a royal wedding. On his instruction I had already drawn up the deed of grant for the land, and set aside the gold from a secret store that my master kept out of the way of the tax-collectors.</p>

    <p>The matter was settled. It remained only for Lostris to give voice to the request before her groom and all the wedding guests. But she stood pale and silent and withdrawn, seeming neither to see nor hear what was going on around her.</p>

    <p>‘Speak up, my child. What is it that you desire from me?’ My Lord Intef s tones of paternal love were becoming strained, and he shook his daughter’s hand to rouse her. ‘Come, tell your father what he can do to make this happy day complete.’</p>

    <p>My Lady Lostris stirred as though coming awake from a dreadful dream. She looked about her and her tears welled up and threatened to break over her quivering eyelids. She opened her mouth to speak, but what came from her throat was the weak little cry of a wounded bird. She closed her lips again and shook her head speechlessly.</p>

    <p>‘Come, child. Speak out.’ My Lord Intef was having difficulty sustaining an expression of paternal affection. ‘Name your marriage gift, and I will give it to you, whatever it is that you desire.’</p>

    <p>The effort that Lostris had to make was apparent to me, even though I stood so far from her, but this time when she opened her mouth her request rang out over our heads, clear as the music of the lyre. There could not have been a soul in the crowd who did not hear every word of it.</p>

    <p>‘For my gift give me the slave, Taita!’</p>

    <p>My Lord Intef reeled back a pace as though she had thrust a dagger into his belly. He stared at her aghast, his mouth opening and closing without a sound escaping. Only he and I knew the value of the gift that Lostris had demanded. Not even he, with the store of wealth and treasure that he had garnered over a lifetime, could afford such a payment.</p>

    <p>He recovered swiftly. His expression was once more calm and benign, though his lips stretched tight. ‘You are too restrained, my darling daughter. A single slave is no fitting gift for Pharaoh’s bride. Such stinginess is not in my nature. I would rather you accepted a gift of real value, five thousand rings of gold and?’</p>

    <p>‘Father, you have always been too generous with me, but I want only Taita.’</p>

    <p>My Lord Intef smiled a white smile, white teeth, white lips and white rage. While he still stared at Lostris I could see that his mind was racing.</p>

    <p>I was the most valuable of all his possessions. It was not simply my wide range of extraordinary talents that made up the full measure of my worth to him. Even more, it was that I knew intimately every convoluted thread of the intricate tapestry of his affairs. I knew every informer and spy in his network, every person whom he had ever bribed and who had bribed him. I knew which favours were outstanding on each account, which favours remained to be settled, and which grudges were still to be paid off.</p>

    <p>I knew all his enemies, a long list; and I knew those he counted his friends and allies, a much shorter list. I knew where every nugget of his vast treasure was hidden, who were his bankers and his agents and his nominees, and how he had concealed the ownership of great tracts of land and stores of precious metals and gemstones in the legal labyrinth of deeds and titles and servitudes. All of this was information that would delight the tax-collectors and cause Pharaoh to revise his opinion of his grand vizier.</p>

    <p>I doubted that my Lord Intef himself could remember and trace all his wealth without my assistance. He could not properly order and control his sprawling, shadowy empire without me, for he had kept himself aloof and separated from the most unsavoury aspects of it. He had preferred to send me to take care of those details which, if discovered, might incriminate him.</p>

    <p>So it was that I knew a thousand dark secrets, and I knew of a thousand fearful deeds, of embezzlement and extortion, of robbery and bloodiest murder, all of which taken together could destroy even a man as powerful as the grand vizier.</p>

    <p>I was indispensable. He could not let me go. And .yet, before Pharaoh and the entire population of Thebes, he could not deny Lostris her request.</p>

    <p>My Lord Intef is a man full of ire and hatred. I have seen such rage in him that must have made Seth, the god of anger, start up and take notice. But I had never seen such fury as now that his own daughter had him cornered.</p>

    <p>‘Let the slave Taita stand forward,’ he called, and I saw that it was a ruse for him to gain a respite. I pushed my way as swiftly as I was able to the foot of the wedding platform, to give him as little time as possible to plan his next mischief.</p>

    <p>‘I am here, my lord,’ I cried, and he stared down at me with those deadly eyes. We have been together so long that he can speak to me with a look almost as clearly as with the spoken word. He stared at me in silence until my heart was racing and my fingers fluttered with fear, then at last he said in soft, almost affectionate tones, ‘Taita, you have been with me since you were a child. I have come to regard you as a brother more than as a slave. Still, you have heard my daughter’s request. I am by nature a fair and kind man. After all the years it would be inhuman of me to discard you against your wishes. I know that it is unusual for a slave to be given a say in his own disposal, but then your circumstances are indeed unusual. Choose, Taita. If you wish to stay in your home, the only home you have ever known, then I cannot find the heart to send you away. Not even at the request of my own daughter.’ He never took his eyes off me, those terrible yellow eyes. I am not a coward but I am careful of my safety. I realized that I was staring into the eyes of death, and I could not find my voice.</p>

    <p>I tore my gaze from his, and looked towards my Lady Lostris. There was such appeal there, such loneliness and terror, that my own safety counted for nothing. I could not desert her” now, not at any price or under any threat.</p>

    <p>‘How can a poor slave deny the wish of Pharaoh’s wife? I am ready to do the bidding of my new mistress,’ I cried out at the top of my lungs, and I hoped that my voice had a manly ring to it and was not as shrill as it sounded in my own ears.</p>

    <p>‘Come, slave!’ my new mistress ordered. ‘Take your place behind me.’</p>

    <p>As I mounted the platform, I was forced to pass close to &gt; my Lord Intef. His white, stiff lips barely moved as he spoke: for my ears alone. ‘Farewell, my old darling. You are a dead; man.’</p>

    <p>I shuddered as though a poisonous cobra had slid across my path and I hurried to take my place in the retinue of my mistress, as though I truly believed that I could find safety in her protection.</p>

    <p class="Chap">I STAYED CLOSE TO LOSTRIS DURING THE rest of the ceremony and I waited on her personally at the wedding feast, hovering at her elbow and trying to make her eat a little of the meats and fine fare that was spread before her. She was so wan and sickly that I was certain that she had eaten nothing in the last two days, not since her betrothal and the condemnation of Tanus.</p>

    <p>In the end I succeeded in getting her to take a little watered wine, but that was all. Pharaoh saw her drink and thought that she was toasting him. He lifted his own gold chalice, and smiled at her over the rim as he returned the toast, and the wedding guests cheered the couple delightedly.</p>

    <p>‘Taita,’ she whispered to me as soon as the king’s attention was diverted by the grand vizier who sat at his other hand, ‘I fear that I am going to vomit. I cannot stay here another moment. Please take me back to my chamber.’</p>

    <p>It was an impudence and a scandal, and had I not been able to adopt the role of surgeon, I could never have achieved it, but I was able to creep on my knees to the king’s side, and to whisper to him without causing an undue comment amongst the wedding guests, most of whom were well along in wine at this stage.</p>

    <p>As I grew to know him better, I found that Pharaoh was a kindly man, and this was the first proof he gave me of it. He listened to my explanations and then clapped his hands and addressed the guests. ‘My bride will go to her chamber now to prepare for the night ahead,’ he told them, and they leered and greeted the announcement with lewd comment and lascivious applause.</p>

    <p>I helped my mistress to her feet, but she was able to make her obeisance to the king and leave the banquet hall without my support. In her bedchamber she threw up the wine she had drunk into the bowl that I held for her, and then she collapsed upon the bed. The wine was all her stomach contained and my suspicion that she had been starving herself was confirmed.</p>

    <p>‘I don’t want to live without Tanus.’ Her voice was weak, but I knew her well enough to recognize that her will was as strong as ever.</p>

    <p>Tanus is alive,’ I tried to console her. ‘He is strong and young and will live for another fifty years. He loves you and he promises to wait for you to the end of time. The king is an old man, he cannot live for ever?’</p>

    <p>She sat up on the fur bedcover and her voice became stern and determined. ‘I am Tanus’ woman and no other man shall have me. I would rather die.’</p>

    <p>‘We all die in the end, mistress.’ If only I could distract her for the first few days of this marriage, I knew I could see her through. But she understood me too well.</p>

    <p>‘I know what you are up to, but all your pretty words will do you no good. I am going to kill myself. I order you to prepare a draught of poison for me to drink.’</p>

    <p>‘Mistress, I am not versed in the science of poison.’ It was a forlorn attempt, and she crushed it effortlessly.</p>

    <p>‘Many is the time that I have seen you give poison to a suffering animal. Do you not remember your old dog, the one with abscesses in its ears, and your pet gazelle that was mauled by a leopard? You told me that the poison was painless, that it was the same as going to sleep. Well, I want to go to sleep and be embalmed and go on to the other world to wait fpr Tanus there.?</p>

    <p>I had to try other persuasion. ‘But what about me, mistress? You have only this day taken possession of me. How can you abandon me? What will become of me without you? Have pity on me.’ I saw her waver, and I thought I had her, but she lifted her chin stubbornly.</p>

    <p>‘You will be all right, Taita. You will always be all right. My father will take you back gladly after I am dead.’</p>

    <p>‘Please, my little one,’ I used the childhood endearment in a last attempt to cajole her, ‘let us talk of this in the morning. Everything will be different in the sunlight.’</p>

    <p>‘It will be the same,’ she contradicted me. ‘I will be parted from Tanus, and that wrinkled old man will want me in his bed to do horrid things to me.’ Her voice was raised so that the other members of the king’s harem might hear every word. Fortunately most of them were still at the wedding feast, but I trembled at the thought of her description of him being relayed to Pharaoh.</p>

    <p>Her voice became shriller with the edge of hysteria in it. ‘Mix me the poison draught now, this instant, while I watch you do it. I order you to do it. You dare not disobey me!’ This command was so loud that even the guards at the outer gates must be able to hear her, and I dared not argue longer.</p>

    <p>‘Very well, my lady. I will do it. I must fetch my chest of medicine from my rooms.’</p>

    <p>When I returned with the chest under my arm, she was up from the bed and pacing around her chamber with glittering eyes in that pale, tragic face.</p>

    <p>‘I am watching you. Don’t try any of your tricks on me now,’ she warned me, as I prepared the draught from the scarlet glass bottle. She knew that colour warned of the lethal contents.</p>

    <p>When I handed the bowl to her, she showed no fear, and paused only to kiss my cheek. ‘You have been both father and loving brother to me. I thank you for this last kindness. I love you, Taita, and I shall miss you.’</p>

    <p>She lifted the bowl in both hands as though it were a wassail cup rather than a fatal potion.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus, my darling,’ she toasted him with it, ‘they shall never take me from you. We shall meet again on the far side!’ And she drained the bowl at a swallow, then dropped it to shatter on the floor. At last, with a sigh, she fell back upon the bed.</p>

    <p>‘Come, sit beside me. I am afraid to be alone when I die.’</p>

    <p>Taken on her empty stomach, the effect of the draught was very rapid. She had only time to turn her face to me and whisper, ‘Tell Tanus again how much I loved him. Unto the portals of death, and beyond.’ Then her eyes closed and she was gone.</p>

    <p>She lay so still and pale that for a moment I was truly alarmed, afraid that I had misjudged the strength of the powder of the Red Shepenn which I had substituted for the essence of the deadly Datura Pod. It was only when I held a bronze hand-mirror to her mouth that the clouded surface reassured me she still breathed. I covered her gently, and tried to convince myself that in the morning she would be resigned to the fact that she was still alive, and that she would forgive me.</p>

    <p>At that moment there was a peremptory knock upon the door of the outer chamber and I recognized the voice of Aton, the royal chamberlain, demanding entrance. He was another eunuch, one of the special brotherhood of the emasculated, so I could count him as a friend. I hurried through to greet him.</p>

    <p>‘I have come to fetclTyour little mistress to the king’s pleasure, Taita,’ he told me, in high girlish tones so incongruous with such a large frame. He had been gelded before puberty. ‘Is she ready?’</p>

    <p>‘There has been a small mishap,’ I explained, and led him through to see Lostris for himself.</p>

    <p>He puffed out his rouged cheeks with consternation when he saw her condition. ‘What can I tell Pharaoh?’ he cried. ‘He will have me beaten. I will not do it. The woman is your responsibility. You must answer to the king, and stand before his wrath.’</p>

    <p>It was not a duty that I relished, but Aton’s distress was real, and at least I had my medical status to afford me some protection from the king’s frustrated expectations. Reluctantly, I agreed to accompany him to the royal bedchamber. However, I made sure that there was one of the older and more reliable slave maids in attendance in my mistress’s outer chamber before I left her alone.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh had removed his crown and his wig. His head was shaved as bare and white as an ostrich egg. The effect startled even me, and I wondered how my mistress would have responded to the sight. I doubt that it would have raised either her ardour or her opinion of him.</p>

    <p>The king seemed as startled to see me as I was to see him. We stared at each other for a moment before I fell to my knees and made my obeisance.</p>

    <p>‘What is this, Taita the slave? I sent for another?’</p>

    <p>‘Merciful Pharaoh, on behalf of the Lady Lostris I come to beg your understanding and indulgence.’ I launched into a harrowing description of my Lady Lostris’ condition, larding it with obscure medical terms and explanations that were intended to divert the royal appetite. Aton stood beside me, nodding in emphatic corroboration of all I had to say.</p>

    <p>I am sure that it would not have worked with a younger and more vigorous bridegroom, ready and rearing to get to the business, but Mamose was an old bull. It would have been impossible to tally all the lovely women who over the past thirty years or so had enjoyed his services. In single file they would probably have encircled the city of Thebes of a hundred gates, possibly more than once.</p>

    <p>‘Your Majesty,’ Aton interrupted my explanations at last, ‘with your permission, I will fetch you another female companion for the night. Perhaps the little Human with the unusual control of her?’</p>

    <p>‘No, no,’ the king dismissed him. ‘There will be plenty of time for it when the child is recovered from her indisposition. Leave us now, chamberlain. There is some other matter that I wish to discuss with the doctor?I mean, with this slave.’</p>

    <p>As soon as we were alone the king lifted his shift to display his belly. ‘What do you think is the cause of this, doctor?’ I examined the rash that adorned his protuberant paunch, and found it to be an infestation of the common ringworm. Some of the royal women washed less frequently than is desirable in our hot climate. I have noted that filth and the contagious itch go together. The king had probably contracted the infection from one of them.</p>

    <p>‘Is it dangerous? Can you cure it, doctor?’ Fear makes commoners of us all. He was deferring to me now as would any other patient.</p>

    <p>With his permission, I went to my quarters to fetch my medicine chest, and when I returned, I ordered him to lie on the ornate gold and ivory marquetry bed while I massaged an ointment into the inflamed red circle of skin on his belly. The ointment was of my own concoction and would heal the rash within three days, I assured him.</p>

    <p>‘In a great measure you are responsible for the fact.that I have married this child who is your new mistress,’ he told me as I worked. ‘Your ointment may cure my rash, but will your other treatment provide me with a son?’ he demanded. ‘These are troubled times. I must have an heir before I am another year older. The dynasty is in jeopardy.’</p>

    <p>We physicians are always reluctant to guarantee our cures, but then so is the lawyer and the astrologer. While I procrastinated he gave me the escape I was searching for.</p>

    <p>‘I am no longer a young man, Taita. You are a doctor and I can tell you this. My weapon has been in many a fierce battle. Its blade is no longer as keen as once it was. Of late it has failed me when I most had need of it. Do you have something in that box of yours that would stiffen the wilting stem of the lily?’</p>

    <p>‘Pharaoh, I am pleased that you have discussed this with me. Sometimes the gooVwork in mysterious ways?’ we both made the sign to avert evil before I went on, ‘your first congress with my virgin mistress must be perfectly executed. Any faltering, any bending from our purpose, any failure to raise on high the royal sceptre of your manhood, will frustrate our efforts. There will be only one opportunity, the first union must be successful. If we have to try again there will be the danger of your fathering yet another female.’ My medical grounds for this prognosis were rather insubstantial. Nevertheless, we both looked grave, he graver than I did.</p>

    <p>I held up my forefinger. ‘Had we made the attempt tonight, and?’ I said no more, but let my forefinger droop suggestively, and shook my head. ‘No, we are fortunate to have been given another chance by the gods.’</p>

    <p>‘What must we do?’ he demanded anxiously, and I was silent for a long while, kneeling in deep thought beside his bed.</p>

    <p>It was difficult not to let my relief and satisfaction become apparent. Within the first day of my mistress’s marriage, I was already working my way into a position of influence with the king, and I had been offered a perfect excuse for keeping her maidenhead intact for at least a little longer, long enough perhaps for me to be able to prepare her for the brutal shock of her first act of procreation with a man whom she did &lt;w&gt;t love and who was, indeed, physically distasteful to her. I told myself that with clever management of the situation, I might be able to draw out this period of grace indefinitely.</p>

    <p>‘Yes indeed, Your Majesty, I can help you, but it will take some time. It will not be as easy as curing this rash.’ My mind was racing. I had to wring every drop out of this sponge. ‘We will have to go on to a very strict diet.’</p>

    <p>‘No more bull’s balls, I beseech you, doctor.’</p>

    <p>‘I think you have had enough of those now. However, we will need to warm youf blood and sweeten your generative fluids for the fateful attempt. Goat’s milk, warm goat’s milk and honey three times a day, and of course the special potions I will prepare for you from the horn of the rhinoceros and the root of the mandrake.’</p>

    <p>He looked relieved. ‘You are certain this will work?’</p>

    <p>‘It has never failed before, but there is one other measure that is essential.’</p>

    <p>‘What is that?’ His relief evaporated, and he sat up and peered at me anxiously.</p>

    <p>‘Complete abstinence. We must allow the royal member to rest and regain its full strength and force once again. You must forsake your harem and all its pleasures for a while.’ I said this with the dogmatic air of the physician that cannot be gainsaid, for it was the one sure way to ensure that my Lady Lostris would remain untouched. However, I was worried by what his reaction would be. He could conceivably have flown into a rage at the thought of being denied his conjugal pleasures. He might have rejected me, and I could have lost all the advantage that I had so newly won. But I had to take the risk for the benefit of my mistress. I had to protect her just as long as I was able.</p>

    <p>The king’s reaction surprised me. He simply lay back on his headrest and smiled complacently to himself. ‘For how long?’ he asked quite cheerfully, and I was struck by the realization that my strictures had come as a relief to him.</p>

    <p>For me, to whom the act of love with a beautiful woman would always be an unattainable and elusive dream, it took an immense effort to understand that Pharaoh was content to be relieved of a once pleasurable duty that, by reason of being so often performed, had become onerous.</p>

    <p>There must have been at least three hundred wives, and concubines in his harem at that time, and some of those Asian women were notorious for their insatiable appetites. I tried to sympathize with the effort that it must require to act like a god night after night, and year after year. The prospect did not daunt me as the actuality seemed to have wearied the king.</p>

    <p>‘Ninety days,’ I said.</p>

    <p>‘Ninety days?’ he repeated thoughtfully. ‘Nine Egyptian weeks of ten days each?’</p>

    <p>‘At least,’ I said firmly.</p>

    <p>‘Very well.’ He nodded without rancour and changed the subject easily.</p>

    <p>‘My chamberlain tells me, doctor, that apart from your medical skills, you are also one of the three most eminent astrologers in this very Egypt of ours?’</p>

    <p>I wondered why my friend the chamberlain had qualified his assertion. For the life of me I could not think who the other two might be, but I inclined my head modestly. ‘He flatters me, Your Majesty, but perhaps I do have some little knowledge of the heavenly bodies.’</p>

    <p>‘Cast a horoscope for me!’ he ordered, sitting up eagerly.</p>

    <p>‘Now?’ I asked with surprise.</p>

    <p>‘Now!’ he agreed. ‘Why not? For on your orders there is nothing that I should rather be doing at this moment/ That unexpected smile of his was really quite endearing, and despite what he meant to Tanus and my mistress, I found myself liking him.</p>

    <p>‘I shall have to fetch some of my scrolls from the palace library.’</p>

    <p>‘We have all night,’ he pointed out. ‘Fetch whatever you need.’</p>

    <p>The exact time and date of the king’s birth were well documented and I had in the scrolls all the, observations of the movements of the heavenly bodies made by fifty generations of astrologers before me. While the king watched avidly, I made the first cast of the royal horoscope, and before I had half finished it I saw the character of the man, as I had observed it, perfectly endorsed by his stars. The great red wandering star, that we know as the eye of Seth, dominated his destiny. It was the star of conflict and uncertainty, of confusion and war, of sadness and misfortune, and in the end of violent death.</p>

    <p>But how could I tell him all these things?</p>

    <p>I extemporized and put together a scantily veiled resume of the well-documented facts of his life, and laced these with a few less well-known details that I had gathered from my spies, one of whom was the royal chamberlain. Then I followed with the usual assurances of good health and long life that every client wants to hear.</p>

    <p>The king was impressed. ‘You have all the skills that your reputation made me expect.’</p>

    <p>“Thank you, Your Majesty. I am pleased that I have been able to be of service.’. I began to gather up my scrolls and my writing instruments preparatory to taking my leave. It was very late by now. From the darkness beyond the palace walls I had already heard the first cockerel crow.</p>

    <p>‘Wait, Taita. I have not given you permission to leave. You have not told me what I really want to know. Will I have a son and will my dynasty survive?’</p>

    <p>‘Alas, Pharaoh, those matters cannot be predicted by the stars. They can give only the general inclination of your fate, and the overall direction that your life will take, without making clear such details?’</p>

    <p>‘Ah, yes,’ he interrupted me, ‘but there are other means of seeing into the future, are there not?’ I was alarmed by the direction in which his questions were leading, and I attempted to head him off, but he was determined.</p>

    <p>‘You interest me, Taita, and I have made enquiry about you. You are an adept of the Mazes of Ammon-Ra.’ I was distressed. How had he found this out? Very few knew of this esoteric gift of mine, and I wanted it to remain thus. However, I could not blatantly deny it, so I remained silent.</p>

    <p>‘I saw the Mazes hidden at the bottom of your medicine chest,’ he said, and I was relieved that I had not attempted to deny my gift and been caught out in the lie. I shrugged with resignation, for I knew what was coming.</p>
  </div>

  <a id="section_1"></a>

  

  <div>
    <p>‘Work the Mazes for me, and tell me if I am to have an heir and whether or not my dynasty will survive,’ he ordered.</p>

    <p>A horoscope is one thing; it requires only a knowledge of the configuration of the stars and their properties. Some little patience, and the correct procedure will result in a fairly accurate prediction. A divination by the Mazes of Am-mon-Ra is another matter entirely. It requires an expenditure of the life-forces, a burning up of something deep inside the seer that leaves him worn out and exhausted.</p>

    <p>These days I will go to lengths to avoid having to exercise this gift. It is true that on rare occasions I can still be persuaded to work the Mazes, but then for days thereafter I am spiritually and physically depleted. My Lady Lostris, who knows of this strange power of mine, also knows of the effect that it has upon me, and she has forbidden me, for my own sake, to practise it, except occasionally on her behalf.</p>

    <p>However, a slave cannot deny a king, and with a sigh I reached for the leather bag in the bottom of my chest that contained the Mazes. I set the bag aside and prepared a mixture of the herbs that are necessary to open the eyes of the soul, to enable them to look into the future. I drank the potion, and then waited until the familiar but dreaded sensation of rising out of my own body assailed me. I felt dreamy and far from reality as I brought out the leather bag which contained the Mazes.</p>

    <p>The Mazes of Ammon-Ra consist of ten ivory discs. Ten is the mystical number of the greatest potency. Each disc represents a single facet of human existence, from birth to death and the hereafter. With my own hands I had carved the symbols on the face of each of the Mazes. Each one was a tiny masterpiece. By constantly handling and breathing upon them over the years I had endowed them with part of my own life-force.</p>

    <p>I poured them from the bag and began to fondle them, concentrating all my powers upon them. Soon they began to feel warm as living flesh to my touch, and I experienced the familiar sensation of depletion as my own strength flowed.from me into the ivory discs. I arranged the Mazes face-down in two random stacks and invited Pharaoh to take up each pile in turn, to rub them between his fingers and to concentrate all his attention upon them at the same time as he repeated his questions aloud: ‘Will I have a son? Will my dynasty survive?’</p>

    <p>I relaxed completely and opened my soul to allow the spirits of prophecy to enter. The sound of his voice began to penetrate into my soul, deeper and deeper with each repetition, like missiles from a slingshot striking upon the same spot.</p>

    <p>I began to sway slightly where I sat, the same way that the cobra dances to the flute of the snake-charmer. The drug took its full effect. I felt as though my body had no weight to it and that I was floating in air. I spoke as if from a great distance and my voice echoed strangely in my own head, as though I sat in a cavern below the surface of the earth.</p>

    <p>I ordered the king to breathe upon each stack and then to divide it into halves, setting aside one half and retaining the other. Again and again I made him split each pile and then combine the remainder, until he was left with only two of the coin-shaped Mazes.</p>

    <p>For the last time he breathed upon them and then at my instruction placed one in each of my hands. I held them tightly and pressed them to my breast. I could feel my heart pounding against my clenched fists as it absorbed the influence of the Mazes.</p>

    <p>I closed my eyes and from the darkness saw shapes begin to emerge, and strange sounds filled my ears. There was no form or coherence to them, it was all confusion. I felt dizzy, and my senses blurred. I felt myself grow lighter still, until I seemed to float in space. I allowed myself to be carried upwards as though I were a blade of dry grass caught in a whirlwind, one of those dust devils of the Saharan summer.</p>

    <p>The sounds in my head became clearer, and the dark images firmed.</p>

    <p>‘I hear a new-born infant cry.’ My voice was distorted, as though my palate had been riven at birth.</p>

    <p>‘Is it a boy?’ Pharaoh’s question throbbed in my head, so that I felt rather than heard it.</p>

    <p>Then slowly my vision began to harden, and I looked down a long tunnel through the darkness to a light at the far end. The ivory Mazes in my hands were hot as embers from the hearth and seared the flesh of my palms.</p>

    <p>In the nimbus of light at the end of the tunnel I saw a child, lying in the bloody puddle of its own birth-waters, with the fat python of the placenta still coiled upon its belly.</p>

    <p>‘I see a child,’ I croaked.</p>

    <p>‘Is it a boy?’ Pharaoh demanded from out of the surrounding darkness.</p>

    <p>The infant wailed and kicked both legs in the air, and I saw rising from between the chubby thighs a pale finger of flesh surmounted by a cap of wrinkled skin.</p>

    <p>‘A boy,’ I confirmed, and I felt an unexpected tenderness towards this phantom of my mind, as though it were truly flesh and blood. I reached out to it with my heart, but the image faded, and the birth cry receded and was lost in the blackness.</p>

    <p>“The dynasty? What will become of my line? Will it endure?’ The king’s voice reached me, and then was lost in a cacophony of other sounds that filled my head?the sound of battle trumpets, the shouts of men in mortal conflict, and the ring of bronze. I saw the sky above me, and the air was dark with flights of arrows arcing overhead.</p>

    <p>‘War! I see a mighty battle that will change the shape of the world,’ I cried to make myself heard above the sounds of conflict that filled my head.</p>

    <p>‘Will my line survive?’ The king’s voice was frantic, but I paid it no heed, for there was a mighty roaring in my ears, like the sound of the khamsin wind, or the waters of the Nile boiling through the great cataracts. I saw a strange yellow cloud that obscured the horizon of my vision, and the cloud was shot through with flashes of light, which I knew were the reflection of the sun from weapons of war.</p>

    <p>‘What of my dynasty?’ Pharaoh’s voice tugged at my mind, and the vision faded. There was a silence in my head and I saw a tree standing upon the bank of the river. It was a great acacia in full leaf, and its branches were heavy with fruit pods. On the topmost branch was perched a hawk, the royal hawk, but even as I watched, the hawk changed shape and colour. It was transformed into the’double crown of Egypt,’ red and white, the papyrus and the lotus of the two kingdoms entwined. Then, before my eyes, the waters of the Nile rose and fell, and rose and fell again. Five times in all I saw the waters flood.</p>

    <p>While still I stared with burning eyes, abruptly the sk;; above the tree darkened with flying insects, and a dens® cloud of locusts descended upon the tree. They covered ii completely. When they rose again the tree was devastate* and bare of the last trace of green. Not a leaf remained on the dry brown twigs. Then the dead tree toppled and fell ponderously to earth. The fall shattered the trunk and thci crown was smashed into pieces. The fragments turned to dust and were blown away on the wind. Nothing remained but the wind and the driven sands of the desert.</p>

    <p>‘What is it that you see?’ Pharaoh demanded, but it all faded and I found myself once more seated on the floor o&gt; the king’s bedchamber. I was gasping for breath, as though I had run a great distance, and salt sweat scalded my eyesi and poured down my body in rivulets to soak the linen o) my kilt and to form a pool on the tiles beneath me. I was shaking with a burning fever and there was that familiar sicM and heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach that I knew would be with me for days to come.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh was staring at me and I realized what a haggard: and dreadful sight I presented to him. ‘What did you see?’ he whispered. ‘Will my line survive?’</p>

    <p>I could not tell him the truth of my vision, so I invented: another to satisfy him. ‘I saw a forest of great trees thali reached to the horizon of my dream. There was no end ta their number and on top of each tree there was a crown, the red and the white crown of the two kingdoms.’</p>

    <p>Pharaoh sighed and covered his eyes with his hands fon a while. We sat in silence, he in the release that my lie had) given him, and I in sympathy for him.</p>

    <p>At last I lied softly. ‘The forest that I saw was the line: of your descendants,’ I whispered, to spare him. ‘They reachi to the boundaries of time, and each of them wears the crowni of Egypt.’</p>

    <p>He uncovered his eyes, and his gratitude and his joy were; pathetic to watch. ‘Thank you, Taita. I can see how the: divination has taxed your strength. You may go now andl rest. Tomorrow the court will sail for my palace on Elephantine Island. I will have a galley set aside for the safe passage of you and your mistress. Guard her with your life, for she is the vessel that contains the seeds of my immortality.’</p>

    <p>I was so weak that I had to use the frame of the bed to lift myself to my feet. I tottered to the door and steadied myself agaiiist the jamb. However, I was not so weakened that I could not think of my duty to my mistress.</p>

    <p>‘There is the matter of the marriage sheet. The populace will expect to have it displayed,’ I reminded him. ‘Both your reputation and that of my mistress is at stake.’</p>

    <p>‘What do you suggest, Taita?’ This soon he was relying on me. I told him what must be done, and he nodded. ‘See to it!’</p>

    <p>Carefully I folded the sheet that covered the royal bed. It was of the finest linen, white as the high cirrus clouds of summer, embroidered with the rare silk thread that the trade caravans occasionally bring in from the East. I carried the folded sheet with me when I left the king’s bedchamber and made my way back through the still dark and silent palace to the harem.</p>

    <p>My mistress was sleeping like a dead woman, and I knew that with the amount of the-Red Shepenn I had given her, she would sleep the day away and would probably only wake that evening. I sat beside her bed for a while. I felt exhausted and depressed for the Mazes had drained my soul. The images they had evoked still troubled me. I felt certain that the infant I had seen was that of my mistress, but then how could the rest of my vision be explained? There seemed to be no answer to the riddle, and I set the thought aside for I still had work to do.</p>

    <p>Squatting beside Lostris’ bed, I spread the embroidered sheet upon the floor. The blade of my dagger was sharp enough to shave the hair from my forearm. I picked out one of the blue rivers of blood beneath the smooth skin on the inside of my wrist, and I pricked it with the point of the dagger and let the dark slow blood trickle on to the sheet. When I was satisfied with the extent of the stain, I bound up my wrist with a strip of linen to staunch the bleeding, and bundled the soiled sheet.</p>

    <p>The slave girl was still in attendance in the outer chamber. I ordered that Lostris was to be allowed to sleep undisturbed.</p>

    <p>Knowing that she would be well cared for, I was content to leave her, and climb the ladder to the top of the outer wall of the harem.</p>

    <p>The dawn was only just breaking, but already an inquisitive crowd of old women and loiterers had gathered below the walls. They looked up expectantly when I appeared.</p>

    <p>I made a show of shaking out the sheet before I draped it over the ramparts of the outer wall. The bloodstain in the centre of the cloud-white ground was the shape of a flower, and the crowd buzzed with gossip at this badge of my mistress’s virginity and her bridegroom’s virility.</p>

    <p>At the rear of the crowd stood a figure taller than those around him. His head was covered by a striped woolen shawl. It was only when he threw this back and exposed his face and his head of red-gold hair that I recognized him.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus!’ I shouted. ‘I must speak to you.’</p>

    <p>He looked up at me upon the wall, and his eyes were filled with such pain as I wished never to see again. That stain upon the sheet had destroyed his life. I also had known the agony of lost love and remembered every detail of it even after all the long years. Tanus’ heart wound was fresh and bleeding still, more agonizing than any hurt that he had received on the battlefield.</p>

    <p>He needed my help now, if he were to survive it. ‘Tanus! Wait for me.’</p>

    <p>He threw the shawl over his head, covering his face, and he turned from me. Unsteady as a drunkard, he stumbled away.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus!’ I shouted after him. ‘Come back! I must talk to you.’ He did not look round, but quickened his pace.</p>

    <p>By the time that I had climbed down from the wall and run out of the main gates, he had disappeared into the maze of alleys and mud huts of the inner city.</p>

    <p class="Chap">I SEARCHED FOR TANUS HALF THE MORNING, but his quarters were deserted and nobody had seen him in any of his customary haunts.</p>

    <p>At last I had to abandon the search, and to make my wajfcback to my own rooms in the quarters of the slave boys. The royal flotilla was preparing to sail for the south. I had still to assemble and pack my possessions if my mistress and I were to be ready for the departure. I forced aside the sense of gloom that the Mazes and my glimpse of Tanus had left me, and I set about bundling up my possessions and breaking up the only home that I had ever known.</p>

    <p>My animals seemed to sense that something untoward was happening. They fretted and chirped and whined, each trying in his own way to attract my attention. The wild birds hopped and fluttered on the paved terrace outside, while in the corner nearest my bed, my beloved Saker falcons stretched their wings and raised the feathers along their backs, and screeched at me from their perches. The dogs and the cats and the tame gazelle crowded around my legs, trying to brush against me, and hindered my efforts to pack my possessions.</p>

    <p>In exasperation I noticed the jug of soured goat’s milk beside my bed. It is one of my favourite drinks, and the slave boys make certain that the jug is always refilled. My animals also enjoy the thickened milk, so to distract them I carried the jug out on to the terrace and filled their clay drinking-bowls. They crowded around the bowls, pushing and shoving each other, and I left them and went back to my task, closing the awnings of rush matting to keep them out.</p>

    <p>It is curious how many possessions even a slave can gather about him over a lifetime. The boxes and bundles were piled high against one wall before I was at last finished. By this time my mood of depression and weariness was almost prostrating, but I was still sufficiently alert to be aware of the silence. I stood for a while in the centre of my room, listening uneasily. The only sound was the jingle of the tiny bronze bells on the jesses of my female falcon where she sat in the far corner and watched me with that intent, implacable gaze of the raptor. The tiercel, smaller but more handsome than she, was asleep on his own perch in the other corner, with the soft leather hood of the rafter covering his eyes. None of my other pets made a sound. Not one of the cats mewed or hissed at the dogs, nor did the wild birds chirrup or sing, none of my puppies growled or tumbled over each other in boisterous play.</p>

    <p>I went to the rash awning and drew it aside. The sunlight burst into the room and blinded me for a moment. Then my vision returned and I cried out with horror. They were scattered upon the terrace and down into the garden every bird and animal.</p>

    <p>They lay in the abandoned attitudes of death, every one of them where he had fallen. I rushed out to them, calling my favourites by name, kneeling to pick one of them up in my armsi and hugging the slack warm body as I searched for signs of life., There was no flicker of it in any of them, though I went to eachi of them. The birds were small and light in my hand, their mar-velous plumage undimmed by death.</p>

    <p>I thought that my already heavy heart must now burst: with the sheer weight of my grief. I knelt on the terrace with my family scattered around me and I wept.</p>

    <p>It was some time before I could bring myself to think about the cause of this tragedy. Then I stood up and went to one of the empty bowls that lay on the tiles. They had licked it clean, but I sniffed at it to try and fathom the nature of the poison that had been intended for me. The odour of soured milk disguised any other smell; all I knew was that it had been swift and deadly.</p>

    <p>I wondered who had placed the jug beside my bed, but it did not matter whose hand had carried the vessel to me. I knew with utter certainty who had given the order for it. ‘Farewell, my old darling. You are a dead man,’ Lord Intef had told me, and he had not waited long to transform the words into the deed.</p>

    <p>The anger that seized me was a form of madness. It was aggravated by my unsteady state and sombre mood. I found that I was shaking with a rage that I had never known before. I drew the little dagger from my belt and before I realized what I was doing, I was rushing down the steps of the terrace with the naked blade in my hand. I knew that at this time of the morning Intef would be in his water-garden. I could no longer bear to think of him as my Lord Intef. The memory of every outrage he had ever visited upon me, every agony and every humiliation, was bright and clear in my mind. I was going to kill him now, stab him a hundred times through that cruel and evil heart.</p>

    <p>I was in sight of the gate to the water-garden before I regained my sanity. There were half a dozen guards at the gate, and there would be as many more beyond. I would never get within dagger-thrust of the grand vizier before they cut me down. I forced my flying feet to check and turn back. I slipped the dagger into the jewelled leather sheath, and brought my breathing under control. I walked slowly back to the terrace and gathered up the pathetic bodies of my pets.</p>

    <p>I had planned to plant a row of sycamore trees along the border of my garden. The holes to take them had already been dug. The trees would never be planted now that I was leaving Kamak, and the pits would serve as graves for my beloved creatures. It was the middle of the afternoon before I had filled the last grave, but my rage was unabated. If I could not yet have my full vengeance, at least I could give myself a foretaste of it.</p>

    <p>There was still a little of the sour milk left in the jug beside my bed. I held the jug in my hands and tried to think of some way in which I could get it to the grand vizier’s kitchens. It would be so fitting to pay him his own vile coin, although I knew in my heart that the idea was futile. Lord Intef was far too cunning to be taken so easily. I myself had helped him devise the system he used to keep himself secure from poison and assassination. He could not be reached without much careful planning. What was more, he would be especially on his guard now. I would have to be patient, but that was impossible. Even if I could not kill him yet, I could exact some lesser payment as a deposit against what I was determined must follow.</p>

    <p>Still carrying the fatal jug, I slipped out of one of the side-doors of the boys’ quarters into the street. I did not have to go far to find a milkman surrounded by his flock of nanny-goats. While I waited he stripped the rich milk from the swollen udders of one of them, topping the jug to the brim. Whoever had prepared the poison had used enough to murder half the citizens of Karnak. I knew that more than sufficient remained in the jug for my purpose.</p>

    <p>One of the grand vizier’s bodyguards loafed at the door to Rasfer’s chamber. The fact that he had him under guard proved to me that Rasfer was still valuable to Lord Intef, and the loss of his personal lieutenant would annoy if not seriously discommode him. ‘</p>

    <p>The guard recognized me and waved me into the sickroom that smelled like a sty. Rasfer lay on his filthy bed, basting in his own sweat. However, I could tell at once that my surgery had been successful, for he opened his eyes and cursed me weakly. He must also be so certain of his own eventual recovery that he need no longer toady to me.</p>

    <p>‘Where have you been, you ball-less freak?’ he growled at me, hardening my resolve and ridding me of the last traces of any pity that I might have felt for him. ‘I have been in agony ever since you drilled into my skull. What kind of physician are you?’</p>

    <p>There was much more in this style, which I pretended to ignore as I unwound the soiled bandage from around his head. My interest was purely academic as I examined the small wound that the trepan had left in his scalp. It was another perfectly executed operation, and I felt a certain professional regret that it would be wasted.</p>

    <p>‘Give me something for the pain, eunuch!’ Rasfer tried to seize the front of my tunic, but I was too quick for him and stepped back out of his reach.</p>

    <p>I made a fuss of shaking a few crystals of harmless salt from a glass vial into his drinking-bowl, and then topped it up with milk from my jug.</p>

    <p>‘If the pain becomes too bad, this will relieve it,’ I told him as I set the bowl near to his hand. Even at this stage, I could not bring myself to hand it to him directly.</p>

    <p>He heaved himself up on one elbow and reached for the bowl to guzzle it down. Before his fingers touched it, I pushed it out of his reach with my foot. At the moment I thought that this was merely a desire to prolong the anticipation, and I felt satisfaction at his distress as he whined at me, ‘Good Taita, give me the potion. Let me drink. This pain in my head will drive me mad.’</p>

    <p>‘First let’s talk a while, good Rasfer. Did you hear that the Lady Lostris asked for me as her parting gift from Lord Intef?’</p>

    <p>Even in his pain, he grinned at me. ‘You are a fool if you think he will let you go. You are a dead man.’</p>

    <p>“The very words Lord Intef used. Will you mourn for me, Rasfer? Will you weep for me when I am gone?’ I asked softly, and he began to chuckle, then broke it off and glanced at the bowl.</p>

    <p>‘In my own way, I have always been rather fond of you,? he grunted. ‘Now let me have the bowl.’</p>

    <p>‘How fond of me were you when you castrated me?’ I asked, and he stared up at me.</p>

    <p>‘Surely you do not still bear a grudge for that? It was long ago, and besides, I could not disobey the orders of Lord Intef. Be reasonable, Taita, let me have the bowl.’</p>

    <p>‘You laughed as you cut me. Why did you laugh? Did you enjoy it so much?’</p>

    <p>He shrugged and then winced at the pain that the movement caused him. ‘I am a jovial man. I always laugh. Come now, old friend, say you forgive me and let me have the bowl.’</p>

    <p>I nudged it towards him with my foot. He reached out and seized it, his movements still uncoordinated. A few drops slopped over the rim as he raised it greedily to his mouth.</p>

    <p>I didn’t realize what I was about to do, until I had leapt forward and struck the bowl out of his hands. It hit the floor without shattering and rolled into the corner, splashing milk up on to the wall.</p>

    <p>Rasfer and I stared at each other. I was appalled by my own stupidity and my weakness. If ever a man deserved a death by the agony of poison, it was this one. But then I saw again the contorted bodies of my pets strewn across the terrace, and I knew why I had not been able to allow Rasfer to drink. Only a fiend could commit such an act. I have too high a regard for myself ever to descend to the ignominy of the poisoner.</p>

    <p>I saw understanding dawn in Rasfer’s bloodshot eyes. ‘Poison,’ he whispered. ‘The bowl was poisoned.’</p>

    <p>‘It was sent to me by Lord Intef.’ I don’t know why I told him this. Perhaps I was trying to excuse myself for the atrocity that I had almost committed. I don’t know why I was behaving so strangely. Maybe it was still the aftereffects of working the Mazes. I staggered slightly as I turned for the door.</p>

    <p>Behind me Rasfer began to laugh, softly at first and then louder, until great gusty bellows of laughter seemed to shake the walls.</p>

    <p>‘You are a fool, eunuch,’ he roared after me as I ran. ‘You should have done it. You should have killed me, for now as surely as I have a hole between my buttocks, I will kill you.’</p>

    <p>As I had expected, when at last I returned to her chamber my Lady Lostris was still asleep. I settled at the foot of her bed, intending to wait for her to wake on her own. However, the rigours and the exertions of the past day and night had been too much for me. I slumped down and fell asleep, curled like a puppy on the tiles.</p>

    <p class="Chap">I WOKE UNDER ATTACK. SOMETHING struck the side of my head such a painful blow that I was on my feet before I was properly awake. The next blow took me across the shoulder and stung like the bite of a hornet.</p>

    <p>‘You cheated me!’ my Lady Lostris screamed at me. ‘You did not let me die.’ She swung the fan again. It was a formidable weapon, the bamboo handle was as long as twice the span of my arms, and the comb at its head that held the fan of ostrich feathers was of solid silver. Fortunately she was still groggy from the drug and from oversleeping, and her aim was erratic. I ducked under the blow, and the momentum of it swung her around so that she collapsed on the bed again.</p>

    <p>She dropped the fan and burst into tears. ‘I wanted to die. Why did you not let me die?’</p>

    <p>It was some time before I could approach her, and put one arm around her to comfort her. ‘Did I hurt you, Taita?’ she asked. ‘I have never beaten you before.’</p>

    <p>‘Your first attempt was a very good one,’ I congratulated her ruefully. ‘In fact you are so good at it that I do not think you need practise it further.’ Theatrically I rubbed the side of my head, and she smiled through her tears.</p>

    <p>‘Poor Taita. I do treat you so badly. But you did deserve it. You cheated me. I wanted to die and you disobeyed me.’ I saw it was time to change the subject. ‘Mistress, I have the most remarkable news for you. But you must promise to tell no one of it, not even your maids.’ Not since she had first learned to talk had she been able to resist a secret, but then what woman can? The promise of one had always been enough to distract her, and it worked yet again.</p>

    <p>Even with her heart broken and the threat of suicide hanging over her, she sniffed back the last of her tears and ordered, ‘Tell me!’</p>

    <p>Recently, I had accumulated a good store of secrets to choose from, and I paused for a moment to make my selection. I would not tell her of the poisoning of my pets, of course, nor of my glimpse of Tanus. I needed something to cheer her rather than to depress her further.</p>

    <p>‘Last night I went to Pharaoh’s bedchamber and I spoke to him for half the night.’</p>

    <p>The tears rose to the surface of her eyes once more, ‘Oh, Taita, I hate him. He’s an ugly old man. I don’t want to have to?’</p>

    <p>I wanted no more in that vein, in moments she would be weeping again, so I hurried on, ‘I worked the Mazes for him.’ Instantly I had her complete attention. My Lady Los-tris is totally fascinated by my powers of divination. If it were not for the deleterious effect that the Mazes have upon my health, she would make me work them every single day.</p>

    <p>‘Tell me! What did you see?’ She was riveted. No thought of suicide now, all sadness forgotten. She was still so young and artless that I felt ashamed of my trickery, even though it was for her own good.</p>

    <p>‘I had the most extraordinary visions, mistress. I have never had such clear images, such depths of sight?’</p>

    <p>Tell me! I declare I will die of impatience if you don’t tell me immediately.’</p>

    <p>‘First you must swear secrecy. Not another soul must ever know what I saw. These are affairs of state and dire consequence.’</p>

    <p>‘I swear. I swear.’</p>

    <p>‘We cannot take these matters lightly?’</p>

    <p>‘Get on with it, Taita. You are teasing me now. I order you to tell me this very moment or, or,’ she groped for a threat to coerce me, ‘or I shall beat you again.’</p>

    <p>‘Very well. Listen to my vision. I saw a great tree upon the bank of the Nile. Upon the summit of the tree was the crown of Egypt.’</p>

    <p>‘Pharaoh! The tree was the king.’ She saw it at once, and I nodded. ‘Go on, Taita. Tell me the rest of it.’</p>

    <p>‘I saw the Nile rise and fall five times.’</p>

    <p>‘Five years, the passing of five years!’ She clapped her hands with excitement. She loves to unravel the riddles of my dreams.</p>

    <p>“Then the tree was devoured by locusts, and thrown down and turned to dust.’</p>

    <p>She stared at me, unable to utter the words, so I spoke for her. ‘In five years Pharaoh will be dead, and you will be a free woman. Free from your father’s thrall. Free to go to Tanus, with no man to stop you.’</p>

    <p>‘If you are lying to me, it will be too cruel to bear. Please say it is true.’</p>

    <p>‘It is true, my lady, but there is more. In the vision, I saw a new-born babe, a boy child, a son. I felt my love go out to the infant, and I knew that you were the mother of the child.’</p>

    <p>‘The father, who was the father of my baby? Oh, Taita, tell me please.’</p>

    <p>‘In the dream I knew with absolute certainty that the father was Tanus.’ This was the first deviation from the truth that I had allowed myself, but once again I had the consolation of believing that it was for her benefit.</p>

    <p>She was silent for a long time, but her face shone with an inner glow that was all the reward I could ever ask for. Then at last she whispered, ‘I can wait for five years. I was prepared to wait all eternity for him. It will be hard, but I can wait five years for Tanus. You were right not to let me die, Taita. It would have been an offence in the face of the gods.’</p>

    <p>My relief buoyed me up, and I now felt more confident that I would be able to steer her safely through all that lay ahead.</p>

    <p class="Chap">AT DAWN THE FOLLOWING DAY THE royal flotilla sailed south from Karnak. As the king had promised, my Lady Lostris and all her entourage were on board one of the small, fast galleys of the southern squadron.</p>

    <p>I sat with my mistress on the cushions under the awning on the poop that the captain had arranged especially for her. We looked back at the lime-washed buildings of the city shining in the first tangerine tints of the rising sun.</p>

    <p>‘I cannot think where he has gone.’ She was fretting over Tanus as she had a score of times since we had set. sail. ‘Did you look everywhere for him?’</p>

    <p>‘Everywhere,’ I confirmed. ‘I spent half the morning scouring the inner city and the docks. He has disappeared. But I left your message with Kratas. You can be sure Kratas will deliver it to him.’</p>

    <p>‘Five years without him, will they ever pass?’</p>

    <p class="Chap">THE VOYAGE UP-RIVER PASSED PLEASANTLY enough in long, leisurely days spent sitting on the poop-deck in conversation with my mistress. We discussed every detail of our changed circumstances in great depth, and examined all that we might expect and hope for in the future. I explained to her alHhe complexities of life at the court, the precedent and the protocol. I traced for her the hidden lines of power and influence, and I listed all those whom it would be in our interest to cultivate and those whom we could safely ignore. I explained to her the issues of the day, and how Pharaoh stood on each of them. Then I went on to discuss with her the feeling and the mood of the citizenry. In a large measure I was indebted to my friend Aton, the royal chamberlain, for all this intelligence. It seemed that over the last dozen years every ship that had come downriver from Elephantine Island to Karnak had carried a letter from him to me full of these fascinating details, and on its return to Elephantine Island had carried a golden token of my gratitude back to my friend, Aton.</p>

    <p>I was determined that we would soon be at the centre of the court and in the mainstream of power. I had not trained my mistress all these years to see the weapons that I had placed in her armoury rust with disuse. The sym of her many accomplishments and her talents was already formidable, but I was patiently adding to it each day. She had a keen and restless mind. Once I had helped her to throw off theblack mood that had threatened to destroy her, she was, as always, open to my instruction. Every chance I had, I fired up her ambition and her eagerness to take up the role I had planned for her.</p>

    <p>I soon found that one of the most effective means of enlisting her attention and cooperation was to suggest that all this would be to the eventual benefit and advantage of Tanus. ‘If you have influence at court, you will be better able to protect him,’ I pointed out to her. “The king has set him an almost impossible task to fulfil. Tanus will need us if he is to succeed, and if he fails only you will be able to save him from the sentence that the king has placed upon him.’</p>

    <p>‘What can we do to help him carry out his task?’ At the mention of Tanus I immediately had all her attention. ‘Tell me truly, will any man be able to stamp out the Shrikes? Is it not too difficult a mission, even for a man like Tanus?’</p>

    <p>The bandits that terrorized the Upper Kingdom called themselves the Shrikes, after those fierce birds. Our Nile shrike is smaller than a dove; a handsome little creature with a white chest and throat and a black back and cap, it plunders the nests of other birds and makes a grisly display of the pathetic carcasses of its victims by hanging them on the thorns of the acacia tree. Its vernacular name is the Butcher Bird.</p>

    <p>In the beginning the bandits had used it as a cryptic name to conceal their identity and to hide their existence, but since they had grown so strong and fearless, they had adopted it openly and often used the black and white feather of the Butcher Bird as their emblem.</p>

    <p>In the beginning they would leave the feather on the doorway of a home they had robbed or on the corpse of one of their victims. But in those days, so bold and so organized had they become that at times they might send a feather to an intended victim as a warning. In most cases that was all that was necessary to make the victim pay over a half of all he owned in the world. That was preferable to having all of it pillaged, and having his wives and daughters carried off and raped, and he and his sons thrown into the burning ruins of then- home to boot.</p>

    <p>‘Do you think it possible that even with the power of the hawk seal Tanus will be able to carry out the king’s mission?’ my mistress repeated. ‘I have heard that all the bands of the Shrikes in the whole of the Upper Kingdom are controlled by one man, someone that they call the Akh-Seth, the brother of Seth. Is that true, Taita?’</p>

    <p>I thought for a moment before I answered. I could not yet tell her all I knew of the Shrikes, for if I did so, then I would be forced to reveal how such knowledge had come into my possession. At this stage that would not be much to her advantage, nor to my credit. There might be a time for these disclosures later.</p>

    <p>‘I have also heard that rumour,’ I agreed cautiously. ‘It seems to me that if Tanus were to find and crush this one man, Akh-Seth, then the Shrikes would crumble away. But Tanus will need help that only I can give him.’</p>

    <p>She looked at me shrewdly. ‘How can you help him?’ she demanded. ‘And what do you know about this business?’</p>

    <p>She is quick, and hard to deceive. She sensed at once that I was hiding something from her. I had to retreat swiftly and to play on her love of Tanus and her trust in me.</p>

    <p>‘For Tanus’ sake, ask me no more now. Only give me your permission to do what I can to help him complete the task that Pharaoh has set him.’</p>

    <p>‘Yes, of course we must do all in our power. Tell meliow I can help.’</p>

    <p>‘I will stay with you at the court on Elephantine Island for ninety days, but then you must give me leave to go to him?’</p>

    <p>‘No, no,’ she interrupted me, ‘if you can be of help to Tanus, you must go immediately.’</p>

    <p>‘Ninety days,’ I repeated stubbornly. That was the period of grace that I had won for her. Although I was torn between these two dear children of mine, my first duty was to my mistress.</p>

    <p>I knew that I could not leave her alone at the court without a friend or a mentor. I also knew that I had to be with her when the king finally sent for her in the night.</p>

    <p>‘I cannot leave you yet, but don’t wony. I have left a message for Tanus with Kratas. They will be expecting me, and I have explained to Kratas all that has to be done before I arrive back at Kamak.’ I would not tell her more, and there can be few as obtuse or as evasive as I can be when I set myself to it.</p>

    <p>The flotilla sailed only during the day. Neither the navigational skills of Admiral Nembet nor the comfort of the king and his court would stand up to a night passage, so every evening we moored and a forest of hundreds of tents sprang up on the river-bank. Always the royal stewards chose the most congenial spot to pitch camp, usually in a grove of palm trees or in the lee of a sheltering hillock, with a temple or a village nearby from which we were able to draw supplies.</p>

    <p>The entire court was still in festive mood. Every camp was treated as a picnic. There was dancing and feasting in the light of the bonfires, while in the shadows the courtiers intrigued and flirted. Many an alliance both political and carnal was struck during those balmy nights, perfumed with the fruity aromas of the irrigated lands along the river and the spicier desert airs blown in from further afield.</p>

    <p>I used every moment to the best advantage of both my mistress and myself. Of course she was now one of the royal ladies, but there were already several hundred of those, and she was still a very junior wife. Lord Intef’s foresight might change her future status, but only if she bore Pharaoh a son. In the meantime it was up to me.</p>

    <p>Almost every evening after we had gone ashore, Pharaoh sent for me, ostensibly to see to the cure of his ringworm, but in reality t&amp; review the preparations for begetting a male heir to the double crown. While he watched with interest, I prepared my tonic for potency and virility from grated rhinoceros horn and mandrake root, which I mixed with warm goat’s milk and honey. When he had taken this, I examined the royal member and was delighted for the sake of my mistress to find that it possessed neither the length nor the girth that one would have expected from a god. I was of the opinion that my mistress, even in her virgin state, would be able to cope with its modest dimensions without too much discomfort. Naturally I would do all in my power to avoid the dread moment, but if I was unable to stave it off, then I was determined to ease the passage to womanhood for her.</p>

    <p>Having found the king to be healthy if unremarkable in these regions, I recommended a poultice of cornflour mixed with olive oil and honey to be applied to the royal member at night before retiring, and then I went on to deal with the ringworm. To the king’s intense gratification my ointment cured the condition within the three days that I had promised, and my already considerable reputation as a physician was enhanced. The king boasted of my accomplishment to his council of ministers, and within days I was in huge demand throughout the court. Then, when it was known that I was not only a healer but also an astrologer whom even the king consulted, my popularity became boundless.</p>

    <p>Every,evening there came to our tents a succession of messengers bearing expensive gifts for my mistress from this lady or that lord and begging that she allow me to visit them for a consultation. We acceded to only those with whom we wished to make better acquaintance. Once I was in the tent of a powerful and noble lord, he with his kilt up around his waist while I examined his haemorrhoids, it was a simple matter to extol my mistress and bring her many virtues to the attention of my patient.</p>

    <p>The other ladies of the harem soon discovered that my Lady Lostris and I sang a beautiful duet together, and that we could compose the most intriguing riddles and tell even more amusing stories. We were in demand throughout the court, and especially amongst the children of the harem. This gave me special pleasure, for if there is anything I love more than animals, it is small children.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh, who was responsible for our popularity in the first place, soon had the increase of it reported to him. This further spurred his interest in my mistress, if it were not already sufficiently intense. At sailing time on many mornings she was summoned on board the royal barge to spend the day in the king’s company, while most evenings, at the royal invitation, my mistress dined at the king’s board, and regaled him and the assembled company with her natural wit and childlike grace. Of course I was always in discreet attendance. When the king made no move to send for her in the night in order to force her to submit to those horrible but rather hazy terrors she had conjured up,’ her feelings towards him began to moderate.</p>

    <p>Beneath his glum exterior Pharaoh Mamose was a kind and decent man. My Lady Lostris soon realized this, and like me, she began to grow quite fond of him. Before we reached Elephantine Island she was treating him like a favourite uncle, and quite unaffectedly would sit on his knee to tell him a story, or would play throwing-sticks with him on the deck of the royal barge, both of them flushed with the exertion and laughing like children. Aton confided to me that he had never seen the king so gay.</p>

    <p>All this was watched and noted by the court, who very soon recognized her as the king’s favourite. Soon there were other visitors to our tents in the evening, those who had a petition which they wished my mistress to bring to Pharaoh’s notice. The gifts they proffered were even more valuable than those offered for my services.</p>

    <p>My mistress had rejected her father’s gift in favour of a single slave, so she had begun the journey southwards as a pauper, dependent on my own modest savings. However, before the voyage was done she had accumulated not only a comfortable fortune, but also a long list of favours owed by her new rich and powerful friends. I kept a careful accounting of all these assets.</p>

    <p>I am not so conceited that I should pretend that my Lady Lostris would not have achieved this recognition without my help. Her beauty and her cleverness and her sweet, warm nature must have made her a favourite in any circumstances. I only suggest that I was able to make it happen a little sooner and a little more certainly.</p>

    <p>Our success brought with it some drawbacks. As always, there was jealousy from those who felt themselves displaced in Pharaoh’s favour, and there was also the matter of Pharaoh’s mounting carnal interest in my mistress. This was aggravated by the period of abstinence that I had enforced upon him.</p>

    <p>One evening in his tent after I had administered his rhinoceros horn, he confided in me, ‘Taita, this cure of yours is really most efficacious. I have not felt so virile since I was a young man, way back before my coronation and my divinity. This morning when I awoke I had a stiffening of the member which was so gratifying that I sent for Aton to view it. He was mightily impressed and he wished forthwith to fetch your mistress.’</p>

    <p>I was thoroughly alarmed by this news, and I put on my sternest expression and shook my head and sucked air through my teeth and tut-tutted to show my disapproval. ‘I am grateful for your good sense in not agreeing to Aton’s suggestion, Your Majesty. It could so easily have undone all our efforts. If you want a son, then you must follow my regime meticulously.’</p>

    <p>This brought home to me the swift passage of time, and how soon the ninety days of grace would be up. I began to condition my mistress for that night which Pharaoh would soon insist upon.</p>

    <p>First I must prepare her mind, and I set about this by pointing out to her that it was inevitable, and that if she wished to outlive the king and eventually to go to Tanus, then she would have to submit to the king’s will. She was always a sensible girl.</p>

    <p>‘Then you will have to explain exactly what it is he expects of me, Taita,’ she sighed. I was not the best guide in this area. My personal experience had been ephemeral, but I was able to outline the fundamentals and to make it seem so commonplace as not to alarm her unduly.</p>

    <p>‘Will it hurt?’ she wanted to know, and I hastened to reassure her.</p>

    <p>‘The king is a kind man. He has much experience of young girls. I am sure he will be gentle with you. I will prepare an ointment for you that will make things much easier. I will apply it every night before you retire. It will open the gateway. Think to yourself that one day Tanus will pass through those same portals, and that you are doing this to welcome him and no other.’</p>

    <p>I tried to remain the aloof physician and take no sensual pleasure in what I had to do to help her. The gods forgive me, but I failed in my resolution. She was so perfect in her womanly parts as to overshadow the most lovely blossom that I had ever raised in my garden. No desert rose ever bore petals so exquisite. When I smoothed the ointment upon them they raised their own sweet dew, more oleaginous and silky to the touch than any unguent that I could concoct.</p>

    <p>Her cheeks turned rosy and her voice was husky as she murmure.d, ‘Up until now, I thought that part of me was meant for only one purpose. Why is it that when you do that, I long so unbearably for Tanus?’</p>

    <p>She trusted me so implicitly, and had so little understanding of these unfamiliar sensations, that it required the exercise of all my ethics as a physician to proceed with the treatment only as long as was necessary. However, I slept only fitfully that night, haunted by dreams of the impossible.</p>

    <p class="Chap">AS WE SAILED DEEPER INTO THE SOUTH, so the belts of green land on each side of the river narrowed. Now the desert began to squeeze in upon us. In places brooding cliffs of black granite trod the verdant fields under foot and pressed so close as to overhang the turgid waters of the Nile.</p>

    <p>The most forbidding of these narrows was known as the Gates of Hapi, and the waters were whipped into a wild and wilful temper as they boiled through the gap in the high cliffs.</p>

    <p>We made the passage of the Gates of Hapi, and came at last to Elephantine, the largest of a great assembly of islands that were strung through the throat of the Nile, where the harsh hills constricted its flow and forced it through the narrows.</p>

    <p>Elephantine was shaped like a monstrous shark pursuing the shoal of lesser islands up the narrows. On either side of the river the encroaching deserts were distinct in colour and character. On the west bank, the Saharan dunes were hot orange and savage as the Bedouin who were the only mortals able to survive amongst them. To the east, the Arabian desert was dun and dirty grey, studded with black hills that danced dreamlike in the heat mirage. These deserts had one thing in common?both of them were killers of men.</p>

    <p>What a delightful contrast was Elephantine Island, set like a glistening green jewel in the silver crown of the river. It took its name from the smooth grey granite boulders that clustered along its bank like a herd of the huge pachyderms and also from the fact that the trade in ivory brought down from the savage land of Cush beyond the cataract had for a thousand years centred upon this place.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh’s palace sprawled over most of the island, and the wags suggested that he had chosen to build it here at the southernmost point in his kingdom to be as far from the red pretender in the north as possible.</p>

    <p>The wide stretch of water that surrounded the island secured it from the attack of an enemy, but the remainder of the city had overflowed on to both main banks. After great Thebes, west and east Elephantine together made up the largest and most populous city in the Upper Kingdom, a worthy rival to Memphis, the seat of the red pretender in the Lower Kingdom.</p>

    <p>As at no other place in the whole of Egypt, Elephantine Island was clad with trees. Their seeds had been brought down by the river on a thousand annual floods, and they had taken root in the fertile loams that had themselves been transported by the restless waters.</p>

    <p>On my last visit to Elephantine, when I had come up-river to do a survey of the river gauges for my Lord Intef in his capacity as Guardian of the Waters, I had spent many months on the island. With the assistance of the head gardener, I had catalogued the names and natural histories of all the plants in the palace gardens, so I was able to point them out to my mistress. There were/Jews trees the like of which had never been seen elsewhere in Egypt. Their fruits grew not upon the branch but on the main trunk, and their roots twisted and writhed together like mating pythons. There were dragon’s blood trees whose bark, when cut, poured out a bright red sap. There were Cushite sycamores and a hundred other varieties that spread a shady green umbrella over the lovely little island.</p>

    <p>The royal palace was built upon the solid granite that lay below the fertile soil and formed the skeleton of the island. I have often wondered that our kings, the long line of phar-aohs of fifty dynasties that stretches back over a thousand years, have each of them devoted so much of his life and treasure to the building of vast and eternal tombs of granite and marble, while in their lifetimes they have been content to live in palaces with mud walls and thatched roofs. In comparison to the magnificent funerary temple that I was building for Pharaoh Mamose at Karnak, this palace was a very modest affair, and the dearth of straight lines and symmetry offended the instincts of both the mathematician and the architect in me. I suppose the sprawling jumble of red clay walls and roofs canted at odd angles did have a sort of bucolic charm, yet I itched to get out my ruler and plumb-line.</p>

    <p>Once we had gone ashore and found the quarters that had been set aside for us, the true appeal of Elephantine was even more apparent. Naturally we were lodged hi the walled harem on the northern tip of the island, but the size and the furnishings of our lodgings confirmed our favoured position, not only with the king but with his chamberlain as well. Aton had made the allocation, and he, like most others, had proved completely defenceless against my mistress’s natural charm, and was now one of her most shameless admirers.</p>

    <p>He placed at our disposal a dozen spacious and airy rooms with our own courtyard and kitchens. A side-gate in the main wall led directly down to the riverside-and a stone jetty. That very first day I purchased a flat-bottomed skiff which we could use for fishing and water-fowling. I kept it moored at the jetty.</p>

    <p>As to the rest of our new home, however comfortable it might have been, neither my mistress nor I was satisfied, and we immediately set about improving and beautifying it. With the cooperation of my old friend the head gardener, I laid out and planted our own private garden hi the courtyard, with a thatched barrazza under which we could sit in the heat of the day, and where I kept my Saker falcons tethered on their perches.</p>

    <p>At the jetty I set up a shadoof to lift from the river a constant flow of water that I led through ceramic pipes to our own water-garden with lily-ponds dnd fish-pools. The overflow from the pools drained away in a narrow gutter. This gutter I directed through the wall of my mistress’s chamber, across a screened corner of the room and out the far side, from whence it returned to the main flow of the Nile. I carved a stool of fragrant cedar wood, with a hole through the seat, and placed this over the gutter so that anything dropped through the bottom of the seat would be borne away by the never-ending flow of water. My mistress was delighted with this innovation and spent far more time perched upon the stool than was really necessary to accomplish the business for which it was originally intended.</p>
  </div>

  <a id="section_2"></a>

  

  <div>
    <p>The walls of our quarters were bare red clay. We designed a set of frescoes for each room. I drew the cartoons and transposed them on to the walls and then my mistress and her maids painted in the designs. The frescoes were scenes from the mythology of the gods, with fanciful landscapes peopled by wonderful animals and birds. Of course, I used my Lady Lostris as my model for the figure of Isis, but was it any wonder that the figure of Horus was central to every painting, or that on the insistence of my mistress, he was depicted as having red-gold hair and that he looked amazingly familiar?</p>

    <p>The frescoes caused a stir throughout the harem and every one of the royal wives took turns to visit us, to drink sherbet and to view the paintings. We had set a fashion, and I was prevailed upon to advise on the redecoration of most of the private apartments in the harem, at a suitable fee, of course. In this process we made many new friends amongst the royal ladies and added considerably to our financial estate.</p>

    <p>Very soon the king heard about the decorations and came in person to examine them. Lostris gave him the grand tour of her chambers. Pharaoh noticed her new water-stool of which my mistress was so proud that when the king asked her to demonstrate it for him she did so without hesitation, perching upon it and giggling as she sent a tinkling stream into the gutter.</p>

    <p>She was still so innocent as not to realize the effect that this display had upon her husband. I could tell by his expression that any attempt that I might make to delay him beyond the promised ninety days was likely to be difficult.</p>

    <p>After the tour, Pharaoh sat under the barrazza and drank a cup of wine while he actually laughed aloud at some of my mistress’s sallies. At last he turned to me. ‘Taita, you must build me a water-garden and a barrazza just like this? only much bigger, and whilst you are about it, you can make a water-stool for me as well.’</p>

    <p>When at last he was ready to leave, he commanded me to walk a little way alone with him, ostensibly to discuss the new water-garden, but I knew better. No sooner had we left the harem than he was at me.</p>

    <p>‘Last night I dreamed of your mistress,’ he told me, ‘and when I awoke, I found that my seed had spilled out upon the sheets. That has not happened to me since I was a boy. This little vixen of yours has begun to fill my thoughts both sleeping and waking. I have no doubt that I can make a son with her, and that we should delay no longer. What do you think, doctor, am I not yet ready for the attempt?’</p>

    <p>‘I counsel you most strongly to observe the ninety days, Majesty. To make the attempt before that would be folly.’ It was dangerous to label the king’s desire as folly, but I was desperate to contain it. ‘It would be most unwise to spoil all our chances of success for so short a period of time.’ In the end I prevailed, and left him looking glummer than ever.</p>

    <p>When I returned to the harem, I warned my mistress of the king’s intentions, and so thoroughly had I conditioned her to accept the inevitable that she showed no undue distress. She was by this time completely resigned to her role as the king’s favourite, while my promise that there would be a term to her captivity here on Elephantine Island made it easier for her to bear. In all fairness, our sojourn on the island could not truly be described as captivity. We Egyptians are the most civilized men on earth. We treat our women well. I have heard of others, the Hurrians and the Cushites and the Libyans, for example, who are most cruel and unnatural towards their wives and daughters.</p>

    <p>The Libyans make of the harem a true prison in which the women live their entire lives without sight of a living male apart from the eunuchs and the children. They say that even male dogs and cats are forbidden to pass through the gates, so great is their possessive frenzy.</p>

    <p>The Hurrians are even worse. Not only do they confine their women and make them cover their bodies from ankle to wrist, but they force them to go masked as well, even within the confines of the harem. Thus only a woman’s husband ever lays eyes upon her face.</p>

    <p>The primitive tribes of Cush are the worst of all of them. When their women reach the age of puberty they circumcise them in the most savage manner. They cut away the clitoris and me inner lips of the vagina to remove the seat of sexual pleasure so that they may never be tempted to stray from their husbands.</p>

    <p>This may seem so bizarre as to defy belief, but I have seen the results of this brutal surgery with my own eyes. Three of my mistress’s slave girls were captured by the slavers only after they were matured and had been subjected to the knife by their own fathers. When I examined the gaping, scar-puckered pits they had been left with, I was sickened, and my instincts as a healer were deeply offended by this mutilation of that masterpiece of the gods, the human body. It has been my observation that this circumcision does not achieve its object, for it seems to deprive the victim of the most desirable female traits, and leaves her cold and calculating and cruel. She becomes a sexless monster.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, we Egyptians honour our women and treat them, if not as equals, at least with consideration. No husband may beat his wife without recourse to the magistrate, and he has a legal duty to dress and feed and maintain her in accordance with his own station in society. A wife of the king, or of one of the nobles, is not confined to the harem, but, if suitably escorted by her entourage, may walk abroad in city street or countryside. She is not forced to hide her charms, but, according to the fashion of the moment and her own whim, she may sit at her husband’s dinner-table with her face uncovered and her breasts bared, and entertain his male companions with conversation and song.</p>

    <p>She may hold, in her own right, slaves and land and fortune separately from the estate of her husband, although the children she bears belong to him alone. She may fish, and fly hawks, and even practise archery, although such masculine endeavours as wrestling and swordsmanship are forbidden to her. There are, quite rightly, certain activities from which she is barred, such as the practice of law and architecture, but a high-born wife is a person of consequence, possessed of legal rights and dignity. Naturally it is not the same for the concubine or for the wife of a common man. They have the same rights as the bullock or the donkey.</p>

    <p>Thus my mistress and I were free to wander abroad to explore the twin cities on each bank of the Nile and the surrounding countryside. In the streets of Elephantine my Lady Lostris was very soon a favourite, and the common people gathered round her to solicit her blessing and her generosity. They applauded her grace and beauty, just as they had done in her native Thebes. I was instructed by her always to carry a large bag of cakes and sweetmeats from which she stuffed the cheeks of every ragamuffin we encountered who seemed to her to require nourishing. Wherever we went, we seemed always to be surrounded by a shrieking, dancing flock of children.</p>

    <p>My mistress always seemed happy to sit in the doorway of a poor shanty with the housewife, or under a tree in the field of a peasant fanner and listen to their woes and grievances. At the first opportunity she would take these up with Pharaoh. Often he would smile indulgently and agree to the redress that she suggested. So her reputation as a champion of the common man was bom. When she passed through even the saddest, poorest quarters of the city, she left smiles and laughter behind her.</p>

    <p>On other days we fished together from our little skiff in the backwaters of the lagoons that the inundation of the Nile had created, or we laid out decoys for the wild duck. I had made a special bow for my mistress which was suited to her strength. Of course it was nothing like the great bow, Lan-ata, that I had designed for Tanus, but it was adequate for the water-fowl we were after. My Lady Lostris was a better marksman than most men I have watched at the archery butts, and when she loosed an arrow it was very seldom that I was not required to plunge overside and swim out to retrieve the carcass of a duck or a goose.</p>

    <p>Whenever the king went out hawking, my mistress was invited to attend. I would walk behind her with my Saker falcons on my arm, as we skirted the edge of the papyrus beds. As soon as a heron rose with heavy wing-beats from a hidden pool in the reeds, she would take one of the falcons from me and kiss its hooded head. ‘Fly fast and true, my beauty!’ she would whisper to it, and slip the rufter to unmask the fierce yellow eyes, and launch the splendid little killer aloft.</p>

    <p>We would watch entranced as the falcon towered high above the quarry, and then folded those sickle wings and stooped with a speed that made the wind sing over his dappled plumage. The shock of impact carried clearly to us over a distance of two hundred paces. A puff of pale blue feathers was smeared across the darker blue of the sky, and then was carried away like smoke on the river breeze. The falcon bound to its prey with hooked talons to bring it smashing to earth. My mistress shrieked in triumph and ran as fast as a boy to retrieve the bird, to lavish praise upon it and pamper it, and then to feed it the severed head of the heron.</p>

    <p>I love all creatures of the water and the land and the air. My mistress has the same feelings. Why is it then, I often wonder, that both of us are so moved by these sports of the chase? I have puzzled over it without finding an answer. Perhaps it is simply that man, and woman also, are the earth’s fiercest predator. We feel a kinship with the falcon, with his beauty and his speed. The heron and the goose were given to the falcon by the gods as his rightful prey. In the same way, man has been given dominance over all other creatures on earth. We cannot deny these instincts with which the gods have endowed us.</p>

    <p>From the earliest age, when she had first developed the strength and the stamina to stay with us, I had allowed my Lady Lostris to accompany Tanus and myself on our hunting and fishing forays. For, perhaps to mask his hatred of his rival, Lord Harrab, my Lord Intef consented to my hunting sorties with young Tanus.</p>

    <p>Years before, Tanus ancH had taken possession of a deserted fisherman’s shack which we had discovered on the fringe of the swamp below Karnak. We had made this our secret hunting-lodge. It was only a short distance from the shack to the edge of the true desert. So from this comfortable base we had the options of fishing the lagoon or of wild-fowling or of hawking that noble bird, the giant bustard, in the open desert.</p>

    <p>In the beginning Tanus had resented the intrusion of this gawky nine-year-old girl, skinny and flat-chested as a boy, into our private world. Soon, however, he had grown accustomed to her presence and even found it convenient to have someone to run errands for him and perform the irksome little chores around camp.</p>

    <p>Thus, little by little, Lostris had picked up the lore and the wisdom of the outdoors, until she knew every fish and bird by its proper name, and could wield a harpoon or a hunting-bow with equal skill. In the end Tanus had become as proud of her as if it had been he who had invited her to join us in the first place.</p>

    <p>She had been with us in the black rock hills above the river valley on the day that Tanus had hunted the cattle-killer. The lion was a scarred old male with a black mane that waved like a field of corn in the wind as he walked, and a voice like the thunder of the heavens. We set my pack of hounds upon him and followed them as they bayed the lion up from the paddock beside the Nile where he had killed his last bullock. The dogs cornered him at the head of a rocky defile. The lion fixed on us as soon as we came up and brushed the dogs aside as he charged through them.</p>

    <p>As he came grunting and roaring towards us, my mistress had stood unwavering, only a pace behind Tanus’ left shoulder, with her own puny little bow at full draw. Of course, it had been Tanus who had killed the beast, sending an arrow from the great bow Lanata hissing down his gaping throat, but we had bcJth seen Lady Lostris’ courage displayed in full measure.</p>

    <p>I think it was probably on that day that Tanus first became aware of his true feelings for her, while for my mistress, the hunt and the chase were for ever bound up with the images and memories of her lover. She had remained ever since an avid huntress. She had learned from Tanus and myself to respect and to love the quarry, but not to burden herself with guilt when she exercised her god-given rights over the other creatures of the earth, to use them as beasts of burden, to consume them as food, or to pursue them as game.</p>

    <p>We may have dominance over the beasts, but in the same way, all men and women are Pharaoh’s cattle, and none may gainsay him. Promptly on the ninetieth night the king sent Aton to fetch my mistress.</p>

    <p class="Chap">BECAUSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP AND HIS own feelings for my mistress, Aton had given me ample warning before he came. I was able to make my final preparations well in advance of his arrival. For the last time I rehearsed my mistress in exactly what to say to the king and how to behave towards him. Then I applied the ointment that I had reserved for this occasion. It was not only a lubricant, but contained also the essence of a herb that I use on other patients to deaden the pain of tooth-ache and other minor afflictions. It had the property of numbing the sensitive mucous membranes of the body.</p>

    <p>She was brave right up to the moment that Aton appeared in the doorway of her chamber, and then her courage deserted her and she turned to me with tears brimming against her lids. ‘I cannot go alone. I am afraid. Please come with me, Taita.’ She was pale beneath the make-up that I had applied so carefully, and a fit of shivering took hold of her so that her small white teeth chattered together softly.</p>

    <p>‘Mistress, you know that is not possible. Pharaoh has sent for you. This once I cannot help you.’</p>

    <p>It was then that Aton came to her aid. ‘Perhaps Taita could wait in the ante-chamber of the king’s bedroom, with me. After all, he is the royal physician, and his services may be needed,’ he suggested in his reedy voice, and my mistress stood on tiptoe to kiss his fat cheek.</p>

    <p>‘You are so kind, Aton,’ she whispered, and he blushed.</p>

    <p>My Lady Lostris held my hand tightly as we followed Aton through the labyrinth of passages to the king’s apartments. In the ante-chamber she squeezed it hard, and then dropped my hand and went to the doorway to the king’s chamber. She paused and looked back at me. She had never looked so lovely or so young and vulnerable. My heart was breaking, but I smiled at her to give her courage. She turned from me and stepped through the curtains. I heard the murmur of the king’s voice as he greeted her and her soft reply.</p>

    <p>Aton seated me on a stool at the low table, then without a word set up the bao board between us. I played without attention, moving the polished round stones in the cups carved into the wooden board, and Aton won three quick games in succession. He had very seldom beaten me before, but I was distracted by the voices from the room beyond, although they were too low for me to catch the actual words.</p>

    <p>Then quite clearly I heard my mistress say, exactly as I had coached her, ‘Please, Your Majesty, be gentle with me. I beseech you, do not hurt me,’ and the appeal was so moving that ,even Aton coughed softly and blew his nose upon his sleeve, while it was all I could do to restrain myself from leaping to my feet and rushing through the curtain to drag her away.</p>

    <p>For a while there was silence and then a single high, sobbing cry that rent my soul, and once again silence.</p>

    <p>Aton and I sat hunched over the bao board, no longer making any pretence at playing. I do not know how long we waited, but it must have been in the last watch of the night when I heard at last the sound of an old man’s snores from beyond the curtain. Aton looked up at me and nodded, then he rose ponderously to his feet.</p>

    <p>Before he reached the curtains, they parted, and my mistress stepped through them and came directly to where I sat. ‘Take me home, Taita,’ she whispered.</p>

    <p>Without thinking about it I picked her up in my arms, and she hugged mexaround the neck and laid her head on my shoulder, just like she used to as a little girl. Aton took up the oil lamp and lit the way for us back to the harem. He left us at the door to my mistress’s bedchamber. I laid her on the bed, and while she drowsed I examined her gently. There was a little blood, just a smear of it on those silken thighs, but it had staunched itself.</p>

    <p>‘Is there any pain, my little one?’ I asked softly, and she opened her eyes and shook her head.</p>

    <p>Then quite unexpectedly she smiled at me. ‘I don’t know what all the fuss was about,’ she murmured. ‘In the end, it was not much worse than using your water-stool, and it didn’t take much longer either.’ And she curled herself in a ball and fell asleep without another sound.</p>

    <p>I almost wept with relief. All my preparations and the numbing herbs I had employed had seen her through without damage to either her body or her sweet spirit.</p>

    <p class="Chap">IN THE MORNING WE WENT OUT HAWKING as though nothing untoward had happened, and my mistress mentioned the subject only once during the day. As we picnicked on the bank of the river, she asked thoughtfully, ‘Will it be the same with Tanus, do you think, Taita?’ ‘No, mistress. You and Tanus love each other. It will be different. It will be the most wonderful moment in your entire life,’ I assured her.</p>

    <p>‘Yes, I know deep in my heart that is how it should be,’ she whispered, and involuntarily both of us looked northwards along the sweep of the Nile, towards Kamak far.below the horizon.</p>

    <p>Although I knew well where my duty towards Tanus lay, life on the island was so idyllic, and I so much enjoyed the exclusive company of my mistress, that I delayed my departure with the excuse that she still needed me. In truth, although Pharaoh sent for her night after night, my mistress had a tough and resilient streak in her and was blessed with the instinct of survival in full measure. Very swiftly she learned how to please the king, but at the same time to remain untouched and emotionally unmoved by it. She did not need me as much as Tanus did. Indeed, it was she who began to nag me to leave her at Elephantine and to journey down-river once again.</p>

    <p>I procrastinated until one evening, after a full day out in the field with the king, we returned late to the palace. I saw to it that my mistress was bathed and her evening meal was laid out for her before I went to my own rooms.</p>

    <p>As I entered my chamber the delicious odour of ripe mangoes and pomegranates filled the air. In the centre of the floor stood a large closed basket which I could tell was filled with these two favourite fruits of mine. I was not surprised to find it there, for never a day passed without gifts being sent to my mistress and me by someone seeking our favours.</p>

    <p>I wondered who it was this time, and my mouth filled with saliva as another whiff of the fragrance filled my nostrils. I had not eaten since noon. As I lifted the woven lid and reached for the reddest and ripest of the pomegranates, the fruit spilled and rolled across the floor. There was a sharp hissing sound and a great black ball of writhing coils and gleaming scales flopped out of the basket and lashed out at my legs.</p>

    <p>I leaped backwards, but not fast enough. The open jaws of the serpent struck the leather heel of my sandal with such force that I very nearly lost my balance. A cloud of venom was released from the curved fangs. The clear but deadly fluid drenched the skin of my ankle, but with another leap, I managed to evade the second strike that followed immediately upon the first. I threw myself back against the wall in the far corner of the room.</p>

    <p>The cobra and I confronted each other across the width of the floor. Half its body was coiled upon itself, but the front portion of it was raised as high as my shoulder. Its hood was extended to display the broad black and white bands which patterned it. Like some dreadful black lily of death swaying upon its stem, it watched me with those glittering, beady eyes, and I realized that it stood between me and the only door to the chamber.</p>

    <p>It is true that some cobras are kept as pets. They are given the run of the household, and they keep down the numbers of rats and mice that infest the building. They will drink milk from a jug andx become as tame as kittens. There are others of these serpents that are trained by methods of torment and provocation to become deadly tools of the assassin. I was in no doubt as to which kind of cobra this was standing before me now.</p>

    <p>I sidled along the wall, trying to outflank it and to reach safety. It launched itself at me, and the gape of its jaw was a pale sickly yellow and tendrils of venom drooled from the tips of its fangs. Involuntarily I yelled with terror as I sprang away from it and cowered in my corner again. The serpent recovered swiftly from the strike, and reared upright. It was still between me and the doorway. I knew that its poison sacs were charged with sufficient venom to kill a hundred strong men. As I watched, its lower body uncoiled slowly and it began to glide across the floor towards me, its flaring head held high and those terrible, bright little eyes fastened upon me.</p>

    <p>I have seen one of these snakes mesmerize a fowl so that it made no move to escape at this sinuous approach, but lay before it with a patent air of resignation. I was paralyzed in the same way, and found that I could neither move nor cry out again as death glided towards me.</p>

    <p>Then suddenly I saw a movement beyond the swaying cobra. My Lady Lostris appeared in the doorway, summoned by my first terrified cry. I found my voice again, and I screamed at her, ‘Be careful! Come no closer!’</p>

    <p>She paid no heed to my warning as she took in the scene at a glance. A moment’s delay or hesitation on her part, and the serpent would have struck at me for the third and last time. My mistress had been at her dinner when she heard my cry for help. She stood now with a half-eaten melon in one hand and a silver knife in the other, and she reacted with the swift instinct of a true huntress.</p>

    <p>Tanus had taught her to forsake the awkward double-jointed manner of throwing that is natural to the female, and she hurled the melon she held with the force and aim of a trained javelineer. It struck the cobra upon the back of its extended hood, and for a fleeting instant the blow knocked it flat upon the tiled floor. Like the release of a war bow, the serpent whipped erect and turned its dreadful head towards my mistress and then sped at her across the room in full attack.</p>

    <p>I was released from my trance at last and started forward to help her, but I was too slow. Using its tail as a fulcrum, the cobra swung forward and aimed at her with its jaws so widely distended that venom sprayed from its erect fangs in a fine, pale mist. My mistress leaped back, agile and swift as a gazelle before the rush of the hunting cheetah. The cobra missed its strike, and for an instant the impetus threw it flat at her feet, extended to its full glistening, scaly length.</p>

    <p>I do not know what possessed her, but she had never lacked in courage. Before the cobra could recover, she hopped forward again and landed with both those neat little sandalled feet upon the back of its head, pinning it to the tiles with her full weight.</p>

    <p>Perhaps she had expected to crush its spine, but the snake was as thick as her wrist and resilient as the lash of Rasfer’s whip. Although its head was pinned, the rest of its long body whipped up and over and coiled around her legs. A woman of lesser sense and nerve might have tried to escape that loathsome embrace. If she had done so my mistress would have died, for the instant the cobra’s head was freed the death-strike would have followed.</p>

    <p>Instead, she kept both feet planted firmly upon the writhing serpent, spreading her arms to balance herself, and she screamed out, ‘Help me, Taita!’</p>

    <p>I was, already halfway across the room, and now I dived full length and thrust my hands into the coils of the serpent’s body that boiled around her legs. I groped along its sinuous length, down to where it narrowed into the neck, and I seized it and locked both my hands around the cobra’s throat, with my fingers entwined.</p>

    <p>‘I have him!’ I yelled, almost incoherent with my own horror and loathing for this cold, scaly creature that struggled in my grip. ‘I have him! Get away from us! Stand clear!’</p>

    <p>My mistress leaped back obediently, and I came to my feet clutching the creature with a frantic strength, trying to keep its gaping jaws away from my face. The tail whipped back and wound around my shoulders and my neck, threatening to strangle me as I clung to the head. With this grip upon me the snake now had purchase, and its strength was terrifying. I found that I could not hold it, even with both my fists locked around its throat. It was gradually forcing its head free, drawing it inexorably back through my fingers. I realized that the instant it broke out of my grip, it would lash out at my unprotected face.</p>

    <p>‘I can’t hold it!’ I screamed, more to myself than to Lady Lostris. I was holding it at arm’s-length, but it was pulling itself towards my face, drawing closer to my eyes every moment as waves of power pulsed through it, contracting and tightening the coils around my throat, forcing the head back through my fingers.</p>

    <p>Although my knuckles were white with the strength of my grip, the cobra was so close to my face that I could see the fangs flicking back and forth in the roof of its wide gaping jaws. The cobra was able to erect or to flatten them at will. They were bony white needles, and pale, smoky jets of venom spurted from -their tips. I knew that if even a droplet of that poison entered my eyes, it would blind me, and the burning pain of it might drive me half-mad.</p>

    <p>I twisted the snake’s head away from my face so that the spray of poison was discharged into the air, and I screamed again in despair, ‘Call one of the slaves to help me!’</p>

    <p>‘On the table!’ my mistress spoke close beside me. ‘Hold its head on the table!’ I was startled. I had thought that she had obeyed my order and run to find help, but she was at my side, and I saw that she still brandished the silver table-knife.</p>

    <p>Carrying the cobra with me, I staggered across the floor and fell to my knees beside the low table. With a supreme effort I managed to force the snake’s head down across one edge of the table, and to hold it there. It gave my mistress a chopping-block against which to wield the knife. She hacked at the base of the cobra’s neck, behind the hideous head.</p>

    <p>The snake felt the first cut and redoubled its struggles. Coil after coil of rubbery flesh lashed and contorted around my head. Hissing bursts of air flew from its gape, almost deafening us, the awful din mingling with the spurts of venom from its fangs.</p>

    <p>The little blade was sharp, and the scaly flesh parted under it. Slippery, cool, ophidian blood welled up over my fingers, but the blade bit down to the bone of the spine. With all her strength and with her face contorted by the effort, my mistress sawed at the bone, but now my fingers were lubricated by the cobra’s blood. I felt the head slither out between them and the serpent was free, but at the same moment the knife found the joint between the vertebrae and slipped through, cleaving the spine.</p>

    <p>Dangling by a thread of-skin, the head was thrown about loosely by the cobra’s death-throes. Although almost severed from the body, the fangs still flickered and oozed poison. The lightest touch would be enough to drive them into my flesh. I tore at the body with frenzied, bloody fingers and at last managed to unwind it from around my throat, and to hurl it to the floor.</p>

    <p>As the two of us backed away to the door, the snake continued its grotesque contortions, knotting itself and coiling into a ball, scaly turns sliding over each other.</p>

    <p>‘Are you harmed, my lady?’ I asked, without being able to tear my eyes away from the death-throes of the carcass. ‘Is there any of the venom in your eyes or on your skin?’</p>

    <p>‘I am all right,’ she whispered. ‘And you, Taita?’ The tone of her voice alarmed me enough to make me forget my own distress, and I looked at her face. The reaction from danger had already seized her, and she was beginning to shake. Her dark green eyes were too large to fit that glassy white face. I had to find some way to release her from the icy grip of shock.</p>

    <p>‘Well,’ I said briskly, ‘that takes care of tomorrow evening’s dinner. I do so love a nice piece of roast cobra.’</p>

    <p>For a moment she stared at me blankly and then she let out a peal of hysterical laughter. My own laughter was no less wild and unrestrained. We clung helplessly to each other and laughed until tears poured down our cheeks.</p>

    <p class="Chap">I WOULD NOT TRUST OUR COOK WITH IT, so I prepared the cobra myself. I skinned and gutted it and stuffed it with wild garlic and other herbs, together with a dollop of mutton fat from the tail of a prime ram. Then I coiled it in a ball and wrapped ir\in banana leaves and covered the whole bundle with a thick coating of wet clay. I built over the lump of clay a hot fire which I kept burning all day.</p>

    <p>That evening when I cracked open the hard-baked ball of clay, the aroma released by the succulent white flesh flooded our mouths with saliva. There are those who have dined at my table who say they have never eaten tastier food than that which I prepare, and who am I to contradict my friends?</p>

    <p>I served the flaky fillets to my mistress with a wine of five-palm quality that Aton had chanced upon in Pharaoh’s store-rooms. My Lady Lostris insisted that I sit with her under the barrazza in the courtyard and share the meal. We agreed that it was better than the tail of crocodile, or even than the flesh of the finest perch from the Nile.</p>

    <p>It was only when we had eaten our fill and sent the rest of it to her slave maidens that we broached the matter of who it was that had sent me the gift of the basket of fruit.</p>

    <p>I tried not to alarm my mistress, and made a joke of it: ‘It must have been somebody who does not like my singing! ‘ However, she was not to be put off so easily.</p>

    <p>‘Don’t play the clown with me, Taita. It is one direction in which you have little talent. I think you know who it was, and I think I do as well.’</p>

    <p>I stared at her, not sure how to deal with what I suspected was coming. I had always protected her, even from the truth. I wondered how far she had seen through me.</p>

    <p>‘It was my father,’ she said with such finality that there was no reply or denial I could give her. ‘Tell me about him, Taita. Tell me all the things I should know about him, but which you never dared tell me.’</p>

    <p>It came hard at first. A lifetime of reticence cannot be overcome in a moment. It was still difficult to realize that I was no longer completely under the thrall-of Lord Intef. Deeply as I had always hated him, he had dominated me body and soul since my childhood, and there persisted a kind of perverse loyalty that made it difficult for me to speak out freely against him. Weakly I attempted to fob her off with only the barest outlines of her father’s clandestine activities, but she cut across me impatiently.</p>

    <p>‘Come now! Don’t take me for a fool. I know more about my father than you ever dreamed. It is time for me to learn the rest of it. I charge you straight, tell me everything.’</p>

    <p>So I obeyed her, and there was so much to tell that the full moon was halfway up the sky before I was done. We sat in silence for a long time afterwards. I had left out nothing, nor had I tried to deny or to excuse my own part in any of it.</p>

    <p>‘No wonder he wantsyou dead,’ she whispered at last. ‘You know enough to destroy him.’ She was silent a little longer, and then she went on, ‘My father is a monster. How is it possible that I am any different from him? Why, as his daughter, am I not also possessed by such unnatural instincts?’</p>

    <p>‘We must thank all the gods that you are not. But mistress, do you not despise me also for what I have done?’</p>

    <p>She reached across and touched my hand: ‘You forget that I have known you all my life, since the day that my mother died giving birth to me. I know what you really are. Anything you did, you were forced to do, and freely I forgive you for it.’</p>

    <p>She sprang to her feet and paced restlessly around the lily pond before she returned to where I sat.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus is in terrible danger from my father. I never realized just how much until this evening. He must be warned so that he will be able to protect himself. You must go to him now, Taita, without delaying another day.’</p>

    <p>‘Mistress?’ I began, but she cut me off brusquely.</p>

    <p>‘No, Taita, I will not listen to any more of your sly excuses. You will leave for Karnak tomorrow.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">SO BEFORE SUNRISE THE NEXT MORNING I set out fishing, alone in the skiff. However, I made certain that at least a dozen slaves and sentries saw me leave the island.</p>

    <p>In a backwater of the lagoon I opened the leather bag in which I had concealed a tom-cat that had befriended me. He was a sad old animal riddled with mange and with agonizing canker in both ears. For some time I had been steeling myself to give him release from his misery. Now I fed him a lump of raw meat laced with Datura essence. I held him on my lap and stroked him as he ate, and he purred contentedly. As soon as he slipped painlessly into oblivion, I cut his throat.</p>

    <p>I sprinkled the blood over the skiff, and dropped the carcass of the cat overboard where I knew that the crocodiles would soon dispose of it. Then, leaving my harpoons and lines and other gear on board, I pushed the skiff out into the slow current and waded through the papyrus beds to hard ground.</p>

    <p>We had agreed that my mistress would wait until nightfall before she raised the alarm. It would be noon tomorrow before they found the blood-smeared skiff and concluded that I had been taken by a crocodile or been murdered by a band of the Shrikes.</p>

    <p>Once I was ashore, I changed swiftly into the costume I had brought with me. I had chosen to impersonate one of the priests of Osiris. I would often ape their stilted gait and pompous manners for the amusement of my mistress. It needed only a wig, a touch of make-up and the correct costume to make the transformation. The priests are always on the move, up and down along the river, travelling between one temple and another, begging or rather demanding alms along the way. I would excite little interest, and my disguise might help to discourage an attack by the Shrikes. On superstitious grounds they were often reluctant to interfere with the holy men.</p>

    <p>I skirted the lagoon and entered the town of West Elephantine through the poor quarter. At the docks I approached one of the barge captains who was loading a cargo of corn in leather bags and clay jugs of oil. With the right degree of arrogance I demanded free passage td Karnak in the name of the god, and he shrugged and spat on the deck, but allowed me to come aboard. All men are resigned to the extortions of the brotherhood. They may despise the priests, but they also fear their power, both spiritual and secular. Some say that the priesthood wields almost as much power as does Pharaoh himself.</p>

    <p>The moon was full and the barge captain a more intrepid mariner than Admiral Nembet. We did not anchor at night. With the breeze and the full flood of the Nile behind us, we made a fair passage and on the fifth day rounded the bend of the river and saw the city of Karnak lying before us.</p>

    <p>My stomach was queasy as I went ashore, for this was my town and every beggar and idler knew me well. If I were recognized, Lord Intef would hear about it before I could reach the city gates. However, my disguise held up, and I kept to the back alleys as I hurried in a purposeful and priestly manner to Tanus’ house near the squadron base.</p>

    <p>His front door was unbarred. I entered as though I had the right, and closed the door securely behind me. The starkly furnished rooms were deserted and when I searched diem, I found nothing to give me any indication of his whereabouts. Tanus had obviously been gone for a long time, possibly since my mistress and I had left Karnak. The milk in a jug by the window had thickened and dried like hard cheese, and a crust of sorghum bread on the plate beside it was covered with a blue mould.</p>

    <p>As far as I could see, nothing was missing; even the bow Lanata still hung on its rack above his bed. For Tanus to have left that was extraordinary. Usually it was like an extension of his body. I hid it away carefully in a secret compartment below his sleeping-place, which I had built for him when first he had moved into these lodgings. I wished to avoid moving around the city in daylight, so I remained in Tanus’ rooms for the rest of that afternoon, occupying myself with cleaning up the dust and filth that had accumulated.</p>

    <p>At nightfall I slipped out and went down to the riverside. I saw immediately that the Breath ofHorus was at her moorings. She had obviously been in action since last I had seen her, and had suffered battle damage. Her bows were shattered and her timbers amidships had been scorched and charred.</p>

    <p>I noted with a stir of proprietary pride that Tanus had made the modifications to her hull that I had designed. The gilded metal horn protruded from her bows, just above the water-line. From its battered condition I surmised that it fiad done fierce execution amongst the fleets of the red pretender.</p>

    <p>However, I could see that neither Tanus nor Kratas was on deck. A junior officer whom I recognized had the watch, but I discarded the idea of hailing him, and instead set out to tour the sailors’ haunts around the area of the docks.</p>

    <p>It says a great deal for the morals and the sanctity of the priests of Osiris that I was welcomed in the dives and whorehouses like an habitue. In one of the more respectable taverns I recognized the impressive figure of Kratas. He was drinking and playing at dice with a group of his brother officers. I made no move to approach him, but I watched him across the crowded room. Meanwhile I fended off the advances of a succession of pleasure-birds of both sexes who were progressively lowering their tariffs in their efforts to tempt me out into the dark alleyway to sample their well-displayed charms. None of them were in the least deterred by my priestly collar of blue glass beads.</p>

    <p>When “Kratas at last gave his companions a hearty goodnight and made his way out into the alley, I followed his tall figure with relief.</p>

    <p>‘What is it you want from me now, beloved of the gods?’ he growled at me with scorn when I hurried up beside ‘him. ‘Is it my gold or my bum-splitter you crave?’ Many of the priests had taken enthusiastically to this modern vogue for pederasty.</p>

    <p>Til take the gold,’ I told him. ‘You have more of that than the other, Kratas.’ He stopped dead in his tracks and stared at me suspiciously. His bluff and handsome features were only a little flushed and befuddled by liquor.</p>

    <p>‘How do you know my name?’ He seized me by the shoulder and dragged me into a lighted doorway, and studied my face. At last he snatched the wig from off my head.</p>

    <p>‘By the piles between Seth’s buttocks, it’s you, Taita!’ he roared.</p>

    <p>‘I’d be obliged if you would refrain from shouting out my name to all the world,’ I told him, and he turned serious at once.</p>

    <p>‘Come! We’ll go to my rooms.’</p>

    <p>Once we were alone, he poured two mugs of beer. ‘Haven’t you had enough of that?’ I asked, and he grinned at me.</p>

    <p>‘We’ll only know the answer to that in the morning. How now, Taita! Don’t be too strict with me. We have been down-river raiding the red usurper’s fleet for the past three weeks. Sweet Hapi, but that bow-horn of yours works wonders. We cut up nearly twenty of his galleys and we chopped the heads off a couple of hundred of his rascals. Although it was thirsty work, not a drop of anything stronger than water has passed my lips in all that time. Don’t begrudge me a mouthful of beer now. Drink with me!’ He raised his mug, and I was also thirsty. I saluted him in return, but as I put the mug down again, I asked, ‘Where is Tanus?’</p>

    <p>He sobered instantly v ‘Tanus has disappeared,’ he said, and I stared at him.</p>

    <p>‘Disappeared? What do you mean, disappeared? Did he not lead the raid down-river?’</p>

    <p>Kratas shook his head. ‘No. He’s gone. Vanished. I have had my men scour every street and every house in all of Thebes. There is no sign of him. I tell you, Taita, I am worried, really worried.’</p>

    <p>‘When did you last see him?’</p>

    <p>‘Two days after the royal wedding, after the Lady Lostris married the king, on the evening of the day that you sailed with the royal flotilla for Elephantine. I tried to talk some sense into his thick head, but he would not listen.’-</p>

    <p>‘What did he say?’</p>

    <p>‘He handed over the command of the Breath of Horus and the entire squadron to me.’</p>

    <p>‘He could not do that, surely?’</p>

    <p>‘Yes, he could. He used the authority of Pharaoh’s hawk</p>

    <p>I nodded. ‘And then? What did he do?’ ‘I have just told you. He disappeared.’</p>

    <p>I sipped at the mug of beer as I tried to think it out. Meanwhile Kratas went to the window and urinated through it It splashed noisily into the street below and I heard a startled passer-by shout up at him, ‘Careful where you spray, you filthy pig.?</p>

    <p>Kratas leaned out and quite cheerfully offered to crack his skull for him, and the man’s grumblings receded rapidly. Chortling with this small victory, Kratas came back to me and I asked, ‘What mood was Tanus in when he left you?’</p>

    <p>Kratas turned serious again. “The blackest and most ugly temper I have ever witnessed. He cursed the gods and Pharaoh. He even cursed the Lady Lostris and called her a royal whore.’</p>

    <p>I winced to hear it. Yet I knew that this was not my Tanus speaking. It was the voice of despairing and hopeless love.</p>

    <p>‘He said that Pharaoh could carry out his threat to have him strangled for sedition and he would welcome the release. No, he was in terrible straits and there was nothing that I could do or say to comfort him.’</p>

    <p>‘That was all? He gave you no hint as to what he intended?’ Kratas shook his head and refilled his beer mug.</p>

    <p>‘What happened to the hawk seal?’ I asked.</p>

    <p>‘He left it with me. He said he had no further use for it. I have it safe aboard the Breath of Horus.’</p>

    <p>‘What of the other arrangements that I discussed with you? Have you done what I asked?’</p>

    <p>He looked into his mug guiltily and muttered, ‘I began to make the arrangements, but after Tanus was gone, there seemed no point to it. Besides, I have been busy down-river since then.’</p>

    <p>‘It is not like you, Kratas, to be so unreliable.’ I had found that with Kratas hurt disappointment was more effective man anger. ‘My Lady Lostris was relying on you. She told me that she trusted you completely. Kratas is a great rock of strength?those were her exact words.’</p>

    <p>I could see that it was working yet again, for Kratas is also one of my mistress’s ardent admirers. Even a hint of her displeasure would move him.</p>

    <p>‘Damn you, Taita, you make me sound like a weak-kneed idiot?’ I kept silent, but silent can be more irksome than words. ‘What in the name of Horus does the Lady Lostris want me to do?’</p>

    <p>‘Nothing more than I asked you to do before I left for Elephantine,’ I told him, and he slammed down his mug.</p>

    <p>‘I am a soldier. I cannot leave my duties and take half the squadron to go off on some mad adventure. It was one thing when Tanus had the hawk seal?’</p>

    <p>‘You have the hawk seal now,’ I told him softly.</p>

    <p>He stared at me. ‘I cannot use it without Tanus?’</p>

    <p>‘You are his lieutenant. Tanus gave you the hawk seal to use. You know what to do with it. Do it! I will find Tanus and bring him back, but you must be ready by then. There is desperate and bloody work ahead, and Tanus needs you. Don’t let him down, not again.’</p>

    <p>He flushed with anger at the jibe. Til make you swallow those words.’ he promised.</p>

    <p>‘And that will be the finest meal you could set for me,’ I told him. I love brave and honest men, they are so easily manipulated.</p>

    <p class="Chap">I WAS UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW I WOULD make good my promise to find Tanus, but I left Kratas to sleep off his debauch, and I went out into the town again to try. Once more I made the rounds of every one of his old haunts and questioned anyone who could possibly have seen him. I had no illusions as to the risk I was taking in pursuing my enquiries about Tanus, or as to just how flimsy was my disguise if I should run into anybody who knew me well, but I’ had to find him. I kept going through the night, until even the shebeens and whorehouses along the waterfront had thrown out the last drunken customers and doused their lamps.</p>

    <p>As the dawn broke over the river, I stood tired and disconsolate on the bank of the Nile, and tried to think if there was some possibility I had overlooked. A wild honking cry made me look up. High above me a straggling skein of Egyptian geese was outlined against the pale gold and coppery tonep of the eastern sky. Immediately they brought to my mind those happy days that the three of us, Tanus and the Lady Lostris and myself, had spent wild-fowling in the swamps.</p>

    <p>‘Fool!’ I reviled myself. ‘Of course that’s it.’</p>

    <p>By this time they alleyways of the souk were filled with a noisy, jostling crowd. Thebes is the busiest city in the world, no man is idle here. They blow glass and work gold and silver, they weave flax and throw pots. The merchant deals and haggles, the lawyer cants, the priest chants and the whore swives. It is an exciting, flamboyant city and I love it.</p>

    <p>I forced my way through the throng and the hubbub of banter and bargaining as the merchants and the farmers displayed-their wares for the housewives and the bailiffs of the rich households. The souk stank fulsomely of spices and fruits, of vegetables and fish and meats, some of which were far from fresh. Cattle bellowed and goats bleated and added their dung to the human contribution of excrement that trickled down the open gutters towards old Mother Nile.</p>

    <p>I thought of buying an ass, for it would be a long walk in this hottest season of the year, and there were some sturdy beasts on offer. In the end I decided against such extravagance, not only on the grounds of economy, for I knew that once I was out in the open countryside, an expensive animal would certainly attract the attention of the Shrikes. For such a prize they might overcome their religious scruples. Instead, I purchased only a few handfuls of dates and a loaf of bread, a leather bag to carry these provisions and a gourd water-bottle. Then I set out through the narrow streets for the main gate of the city.</p>

    <p>I had not reached the gates when there was a commotion in the street ahead of me and a detachment of the palace guards came towards me, using their staves to force a passage through the market crowds. Close behind them a half-dozen slaves carried an ornate and curtained litter at a jog-trot. I was trapped against the clay-daub walls of one of the buildings and though I recognized both the litter and the commander of the bodyguards, I could not avoid a confrontation.</p>

    <p>Panic seized me. I might survive a casual scrutiny from Rasfer, but I was certain that even under my disguise, my Lord Intef would know me instantly. Standing beside me was an old slave woman with breasts like two great amphorae of olive oil and a backside like a hippopotamus’s. I wriggled sideways until her bulk hid me. Then I settled my wig over my eyes and peeped out from behind her.</p>

    <p>Despite my fears I felt a tingle of professional pride that Rasfer was on his feet again so soon after my surgery. He led his troop of bodyguards towards where I hid, but it was only when he drew almost level that I noticed that one side of his face had collapsed. It was as though his unlovely features had been modelled in wax and then held close to a naked flame. This condition is often the consequence of even the most skilful trepanning. The other half of his face was set in its customary scowl. If Rasfer had been hideous before, now he should cause the children to cry and their elders to make the sign against the evil eye when they looked upon him.</p>

    <p>He passed close by where I stood, and the litter followed him. Through a chink in the embroidered curtains I caught a glimpse of Lord Intef as he sprawled elegantly on pillows of pure silk imported from the East that must have cost at least five gold rings each.</p>

    <p>His cheeks were freshly shaved and his hair was dressed in formal ringlets. On top of his coiffure was set a cone of perfumed beeswax that would melt in the heat and trickle over his scalp and down his neck to cool and soothe his skin. One hand, the fingers stiff with jewelled rings, lay languidly on the smooth brown thigh of a pretty little slave boy who must have been a recent addition to his collection, for I did not recognize him.</p>

    <p>I was taken off-guard by the strength of my own hatred as I looked at my old master. All the countless injuries and humiliations that I had suffered at his hands rushed back to torment me, and these were aggravated by his most recent outrage. By sending the cobra to me he had endangered the life of my mistress. If I had been able to forgive all else, I would never be able to forgive him that.</p>

    <p>He began to turn his head in my direction, but before our eyes could meet, I sank down behind the mountainous woman in, front of me. The litter was borne away down the narrow alley, and as I stared after it, I found that I was trembling just as I had after my struggle with the cobra.</p>

    <p>‘Divine Horus, hear this plea. Grant me no rest until he is dead and gone to his master, Seth,’ I whispered, and I pushed my way on towards the city gate.</p>

    <p class="Chap">THE INUNDATION WAS AT ITS HEIGHT, and the lands along the river were in the fecund embrace of the Nile. As she had done every season from the beginning of time, she was laying down on our fields another rich layer of black silt. When she receded again, those glistening expanses would once more bloom with that shade of green that is peculiar to this very Egypt. The rich silt and the sunshine would raise three crops to harvest before the Nile poured over its banks once more to deliver its bounty.</p>

    <p>The borders of the flooded fields were hemmed with the raised dykes that controlled the flood and also served as roadways. I followed one of these footpaths eastward until I reached the rocky ground along the foothills, then I turned southward. As I went, I paused occasionally to turn over a rock beside the path, until I found what I was looking for. Then I struck out with more determination.</p>

    <p>I kept a wary eye on the rough and broken ground on my right-hand side, for that was just the type of terrain that would afford a fine ambush for a band of Shrikes. I was crossing one of the rocky ravines that lay across the pathway when I was hailed from close at hand.</p>

    <p>‘Pray for me, beloved of the gods!’ My nerves were so tightly strung that I had let out a startled cry and leapt in the air before I could prevent it.</p>

    <p>A shepherd boy sat on the edge of the ravine just above me. He was not more than ten years old, but he seemed as old as man’s first sin. I knew that the Shrikes often used these children as their scouts and their sentinels. This grubby little imp looked perfect for that role. His hair was matted with filth, and he wore a badly tanned goat’s skin that I could smell from where I stood. His eyes were as bright and as avaricious as those of a crow as he ran them over me, assessing my costume and my baggage.</p>
  </div>

  <a id="section_3"></a>

  

  <div>
    <p>‘Where are you headed, and what is your business, good father?’ he asked, and blew a long warbling note on his reed flute that could have been a signal to somebody hidden further up the hillside.</p>

    <p>It took another few moments for my heart to steady its wild pace, and my voice was a little breathless as I told him, ‘You are impertinent, child. What business is it of yours who I am or where I go?’</p>

    <p>Immediately he changed his demeanour towards me. ‘I am starved, gentle priest, an orphan forced to fend for myself. Don’t you have a crust for me in that big bag of yours?’</p>

    <p>‘You look well-nourished to me.’ I turned away, but he scrambled down the bank and danced beside me.</p>

    <p>‘Let me see in your bag, kind father,’ he insisted. ‘Alms, I beg of you, gentle sir.’</p>

    <p>‘Very well, you little ruffian.’ Out of the bag I brought a ripe date. He reached out for it, but before his fingers touched it, I closed my hand and when I opened it again the date had been transformed into a purple scorpion. The poisonous insect lifted its tail menacingly over its head, and the boy screamed and fled back up the bank.</p>

    <p>At the top he paused only long enough to howl at me, ‘You are not a priest. You are one of the desert djinn. You are a devil, not a man.’ Frantically he made the sign against the evil eye and spat three times on the ground, and then he raced away up the hill.</p>

    <p>I had captured the scorpion from under a flat rock farther back along the path. Naturally, I had nipped the sting from the end of its tail before slipping it into my bag in readiness for just such an eventuality. The old slave who had taught me to read lips, had showed me a few other tricks while he was about it. One of them was sleight-of-hand.</p>

    <p>At the shoulder of the next hill I paused to look back. The shepherd boy was on the crest far above me, but he was not alone. There were two men with him. They stood in a group looking down at me, and the child was gesticulating vehemently. As soon as they saw I had spotted them, all three of them disappeared over the skyline. I doubted they would want further truck with a demon priest.</p>

    <p>I had not gone much farther when I saw movement on the track ahead of me, and I stopped short and shaded my eyes against the dazzle of the noonday sun. I was relieved to make out a small and innocent-seeming party coming in my direction. I moved forward cautiously to meet it, and as we drew together, my heart leaped as I thought I recognized Tanus. He was leading a donkey. The doughty little animal was heavily burdened. Atop the large bundle on its back sat a woman and a child, but it trotted on gamely. I saw that the woman was herself heavily burdened, her belly swelling out with her pregnancy. The child balanced behind her was a girl on the verge of puberty.</p>

    <p>I was about to hail Tanus and hurry forward to meet him, when I realized that I was mistaken and the man was a stranger. It was his tall, broad-shouldered figure, the limber way he moved and the shining shock of gold-blond hair that had deceived me. He was watching me suspiciously and had drawn his sword. Now he pulled the donkey off the path and interposed himself between me and the precious burden it carried.</p>

    <p>‘The blessings of the gods upon you, good fellow.’ I played out my role as priest, and he grunted and kept the point of the sword aimed at my belly. No man trusted a stranger in this very Egypt of ours.</p>

    <p>‘You risk the life of your family on this road, my friend. You should have sought out the protection of a caravan. There are brigands in the hills.’ I was truly worried for them. The woman seemed gentle and decent, while the child was on the verge of tears at my warding.</p>

    <p>‘Pass on, priest!’ the man ordered. ‘Keep your advice for those who value it.’</p>

    <p>‘You are kind, gentle sir,’ the woman whispered. ‘We waited a week at Qena for the caravan, and could not wait longer. My mother lives at Luxor, and she will help with the birth of my baby.’</p>

    <p>‘Silence, woman!’ her husband growled at her. ‘We want no truck with strangers, even though they wear the robes of the priesthood.’</p>

    <p>I hesitated, trying to fathom if there was anything that I could do for them. The girl was a pretty little thing with dark obsidian eyes, and she had quite touched my heart. However, at that moment the husband urged the donkey past where I stood, and with a helpless shrug, I watched them go.</p>

    <p>‘You cannot bleed for all of mankind,’ I told myself. ‘Nor can you force your advice on those who reject it.’ Without looking back again, I went on northwards.</p>

    <p>It was late afternoon before I looked down on the spur of rock that thrust out into the green swampland. Even from this vantage-point it was impossible to pick out the shanty. It was hidden deep in the papyrus beds, and the roof was of papyrus stems, so the concealment was perfect. I ran down the path, leaping from rock to rock, until I reached the edge of the water. This far from the main course of the Nile, the flood was not so significant.</p>

    <p>I found our old dilapidated boat tied up at the landing. It was half-flooded and I had to bale it out before committing it to the water. I poled out cautiously along the tunnel through the papyrus. At low ebb of the Nile the shanty stood on dry land, but now there was sufficient water under the stilts that supported it to drown a standing man.</p>

    <p>There was an empty boat in better shape than mine tied to one of the hut stilts. I moored mine beside it, climbed the rickety ladder and peered into our old hunting-lodge. It consisted of a single room, and the sunshine streamed in through the holes in the”thatched roof, but no matter, for it never rains in Upper Egypt.</p>

    <p>The hut had not been in such disorder since the day Tanus and I had first discovered it. Clothing and weapons and cooking-pots were scattered around like the debris of a battlefield. The stink of liquor was even more powerful than that of old food and unwashed bodies.</p>

    <p>Those unwashed bodies were lying on an equally unwashed mattress in the far corner. I crossed the littered floor gingerly to inspect them for signs of life, and at that moment the woman grunted and rolled over. She was young and her naked body was full and enticing, with big round breasts and a thatch of crisp curls at the base of her belly. However, even in repose, her face was hard and common. I had no doubt that Tanus had found her on the waterfront.</p>

    <p>I had always known him to be fastidious, and he was never a drinking man. This creature and the empty wine jars that were stacked against every wall were merely an indication of. how far he had been brought down. I looked at him now as he slept, and hardly recognized him. His face was mottled and bloated with drink and covered with un-trimmed beard. It was clear that he had not shaved since last I had seen him outside the harem walls.</p>

    <p>At that moment the woman woke. Her eyes focused on me and in a single catlike movement she was off the mattress and reaching for the sheathed dagger hanging on the wall beside me. I snatched the weapon away before she could reach it and offered her the naked point.</p>

    <p>‘Go!’ I ordered softly. ‘Before I give you something in your belly that even you have never felt before.’</p>

    <p>She gathered up her clothes and pulled them on hurriedly, all the while staring at me venomously.</p>

    <p>‘He has not paid me,’ she said, once she was dressed.</p>

    <p>‘I am sure you have already helped yourself generously.’ I gestured towards the door with the dagger.</p>

    <p>‘He promised me five rings of gold.’ She changed her tone and began to whine. ‘I have worked hard for him these last twenty days or more. I have done everything for him, cooked and kept his house, serviced him and cleaned up his puke when he was drunk. I must be paid. I will not leave until you pay me?’</p>

    <p>I seized her by a lock of her long black hair and ushered her to the doorway. I helped her, still by means of her hair, into the more dilapidated of the two boats. Once she had poled out of my reach, she turned upon me such a stream of abuse that the egrets and other water-fowl were frightened from the reed-beds around us.</p>

    <p>When I returned to where Tanus lay, he had not moved. I checked the wine jars. Most of them were empty, but there were still two or three that were full. I wondered how he had accumulated such a store of liquor, and guessed that he had probably sent the woman back to Karnak to find a ferryman to ship it out to him. There had been enough to keep the entire corps of the Blue Crocodile Guards drunk for a season. Little wonder that he was in such a condition.</p>

    <p>I sat beside his mattress for a while, letting my sympathy for him run its full course. He had tried to destroy himself. I understood that, and did not despise him for it. His love for my mistress was such that without it he did not wish to continue living.</p>

    <p>Of course I was also angry with him for abusing himself in such a fashion, and for succumbing to such self-indulgent folly. However, even in this pitiful drink-sodden state, I could still find much that was noble and admirable about him. After all, he was not alone in guilt. My mistress had tried to take poison for the very same reason as he had tried to destroy himself. I had understood and forgiven her. Could I do less for Tanus? I sighed for these two young people who were all that I had in Me of any real value. Then I stood up and got to work.</p>

    <p>Firstly, I stood over Tanus for a while, bolstering my anger to the extent that I could be really harsh with him. Then I took him by the heels and dragged him across the floor of the hut. He came half out of his stupor and cursed weakly, but I took no notice of his protests and tumbled him through the doorway. He plunged into the swamp head-first and raised a mighty splash as he went under. I waited for him to come up and flounder about groggily on the surface, still only half-conscious.</p>

    <p>I dropped in beside him, grabbed a double handful of his hair and thrust his head back under-water. For a moment he struggled only weakly and I was able to hold him under with ease. Then his natural instincts of survival took over and he heaved up with all his old strength. I was lifted clear of the surface and thrown aside like a twig in a storm.</p>

    <p>Tanus came out bellowing in the effort to draw breath, and striking out blindly at his unseen adversary. One of those blows would have stunned a hippopotamus, and I backed away hurriedly and watched him from a distance.</p>

    <p>Coughing and choking, he floundered to the ladder and hung upon it with his hair streaming into his eyes. He had obviously swallowed so much water and sucked so much of it into his lungs that I felt a tingle of alarm. My cure might have been a little too vigorous. I was just about to go to his aid, when he opened his mouth wide and a foul mixture of swamp water and rotten wine erupted out of him. I was astonished by the quantity of it.</p>

    <p>He hung on to the ladder, gasping and gurgling for breath. I swam to one of the stilts of the hut and waited until he had vomited again before I told him, putting all the contempt 1 could muster into my voice, ‘My Lady Lostris would be so proud to see you now.’</p>

    <p>He peered about with streaming eyes and focused on me at last. ‘Taita, damn you! Was it you that tried to drown me? You idiot, I could have killed you.’</p>

    <p>‘hi your present condition the only damage you could do would be to a jar of wine. What a sorry, disgusting sight you are!’ I climbed the ladder into the hut and left him in the water, shaking his head and mumbling to himself. I set about tidying up the mess and the filth.</p>

    <p>It was some time before Tanus followed me up the ladder and sat shamefacedly in the doorway. I ignored him-and went on with my work, until at last he was forced to break the silence.</p>

    <p>‘How are you, old friend? I have missed you.’</p>

    <p>‘Others have missed you also. Kratas, for one. The squadron has been fighting down-river. They could have found use for another sword. My Lady Lostris, for another. She speaks of you every day, and holds her love pure and true. I wonder what she would think of that trollop I chased out of your bed?’</p>

    <p>He groaned and held his head. ‘Oh, Taita, don’t speak your mistress’s name. To be reminded of her is unbearable?’</p>

    <p>‘So broach another jug of wine and wallow in your own filth and your self-pity,’ I suggested angrily.</p>

    <p>‘I have lost her for ever. What would you have me do then?’</p>

    <p>‘I would want you to have faith and fortitude, as she has.’</p>

    <p>He looked up at me pitifully. Tell me about her, Taita. How is she? Does she still think of me?’</p>

    <p>‘More is the pity,’ I grunted disgustedly. ‘She thinks of little else. She holds herself ready for the day that you two are brought together again.’</p>

    <p>‘That will never be. I have lost her for ever and I don’t want to go on living.’</p>

    <p>‘Good!’ I agreed briskly. ‘Then I’ll not waste further time here. I’ll tell my mistress that you did not want to hear her message.’ I pushed past him, swarmed down the ladder and dropped into the skiff.</p>

    <p>‘Wait, Taita!’ he called after me. ‘Come back!’</p>

    <p>‘To what purpose? You want to die. Then get on with it. I’ll send the embalmers out to pick up the corpse later.’</p>

    <p>He grinned with embarrassment. ‘All right, I am being a fool. The drink has fuddled my mind. Come back, I beg of you. Give me the message from Lostris.’</p>

    <p>With a show of reluctance I climbed back up the ladder, and he followed me into the hut, staggering only a little.</p>

    <p>‘My mistress bids me tell you that her love for you is untouched by any of the things that have been thrust upon her. She is still and will always be your woman.’</p>

    <p>‘By Horus, she puts me to shame,’ he muttered.</p>

    <p>‘No,’ I disagreed. ‘Your shame is of your own making.’</p>

    <p>He snatched his sword from the scabbard that hung above the filthy bed and slashed out at the row of wine amphorae that stood against the far wall. As each one burst, the wine poured out and trickled through the slats of the floor.</p>

    <p>He was panting as he came back to me, and I scoffed at him. ‘Look at you! You have let yourself go until you are as soft and as short of wind as an old priest?’</p>

    <p>‘Enough of that, Taita! You have had your say. Mock me no more, or you will regret it.’</p>

    <p>I could see he was becoming as angry as I had intended. My insults were stiffening him up nicely. ‘My mistress would have you take uj? the challenge thrown to you by Pharaoh so that you will still be alive and a man of honour and worth in five years’ time, when she is free to come to -you.’</p>

    <p>I had his full attention now. ‘Five years? What is this about, Taita? Will there truly be a term to our suffering?’</p>

    <p>‘I worked the Mazes for Pharaoh. He will be dead in five years from now,’ I told him simply. He stared at me in awe and I saw a hundred different emotions pursue each other across his features. He is as easy to read as this scroll on which I write.</p>

    <p>“The Mazes!’ he whispered at last. Once long ago he had been a doubter, and had disparaged my way with the Mazes. That had changed and he was now an even firmer believer in my powers than my mistress. He had seen my visions become reality too often to be otherwise.</p>

    <p>‘Can you wait that long for your love?’ I asked. ‘My mistress swears that she can wait for you through all eternity. Can you wait a few short years for her?’</p>

    <p>‘She has promised to wait for me?’ he demanded.</p>

    <p>‘Through all eternity,’ I repeated, and I thought he might begin to weep. I could not have faced that, not watched a man like Tanus in tears, so I went on hastily, ‘Don’t you want to hear the vision that the Mazes gave me?’</p>

    <p>He thrust back the tears. ‘Yes! Yes!” he agreed eagerly, and so we began to talk. We talked until the night fell, and then we sat in the darkness and talked some more.</p>

    <p>I told him the things that I had told my Lady Lostris, all the details that I had kept from them both over the years. When I came to the details of how his father, Pianki, Lord Harrab, had been ruined and destroyed by his secret enemy, Tanus’ anger was so fierce that it burned away the last effects of the debauchery from his mind, and by the time the dawn broke over the swamps, his resolve was once more clear and strong.</p>

    <p>‘Let us get on with this enterprise of yours, for it seems the right and proper way.’ He sprang to his feet and girded on his sword scabbard. Although I thought it wise to rest a while and let him recover fully from the effects of the wine, he would have no part of it.</p>

    <p>‘Back to Karnak at once!’ he insisted. ‘Kratas is waiting, and the lust to avenge my father’s memory and to lay eyes on my own sweet love again burns like a fire in my blood.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">ONCE WE HAD LEFT THE SWAMP, TANUS took the lead along the rocky path, and I followed him at a run. As soon as the sun came up above the horizon, the sweat burst out across his back and streamed down to soak the waistband of his kilt. It was as though the rancid old wine was being purged from his body. Although I could hear him panting wildly, he never paused to rest or even moderated his pace, but ran on into the rising heat from the desert without a check.</p>

    <p>It was I who pulled him up with a shout, and we stood shoulder to shoulder and stared ahead. The birds had caught my attention. I had picked out the commotioji of their wings from afar.</p>

    <p>‘Vultures,’ Tanus grunted with ragged breath. ‘They have something dead amongst the rocks.’ He drew his sword and we went forward cautiously.</p>

    <p>We found the man first, and chased the vultures off him in a flurrying storm of wings. I recognized him by the shock of blond hair as the husband I had met on the road the previous day. There was nothing left of his face, for he had lain upon his back and the birds had eaten the flesh away to the bones of the skull. They had picked out his eyes, and the empty sockets stared at the cloudless sky. His lips were gone and he grinned with bloody teeth, as though at the futile joke of our brief existence upon this earth. Tanus rolled him on to his stomach, and we saw at once the stab-wounds in his back that had killed him. There were a dozen of these thrust through his ribs.</p>

    <p>‘Whoever did this was making sure of the job,’ Tanus remarked, hardened to death as only a seasoned soldier can be.</p>

    <p>I walked on into the rocks and a buzzing black cloud of flies rose from the dead body of the wife. I have never understood where the flies come from, how they materialize so swiftly out of the searing dry heat of the desert. I guessed that the wife had aborted while they were busy with her. They must have left her alive after they had taken their pleasure with her. With the last of her strength she had taken the infant protectively in her arms. She had died like that, huddled against a boulder, shielding her still-born infant from the vultures.</p>

    <p>I went on deeper into the broken ground, and once again the flies led me to where the bandits had dragged the little girl. At least one of them had summoned up the compassion to cut her throat after they had finished with her, rather than let her bleed slowly to death.</p>

    <p>One of the flies settled on my lips. I brushed it away and began to weep. Tanus found me still weeping.</p>

    <p>‘Did you know them?’ he asked, and I nodded and cleared my throat to answer.</p>

    <p>‘I met them on the road yesterday. I tried to warn?’ I broke off, for it was not easy to continue. I took a deep breath. “They had a donkey. The Shrikes will have taken it.’</p>

    <p>Tanus nodded. His expression was bleak as he turned away and made a rapid cast amongst the rocks.</p>

    <p>222</p>

    <p>‘This way?, he called, and broke into a run, heading out into the rocky desert.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus!’ I yelled after him. ‘Kratas is waiting?’ But he took not the least notice and I was left with no option but to follow him. I caught up with him again when he lost the tracks of the donkey on a bad piece of ground and was forced to cast ahead.</p>

    <p>‘I feel for that family even more than you do,’ I insisted. ‘But this is folly. Kratas waits for us. We do not have time to waste?’</p>

    <p>He cut me off without even glancing in my direction, ‘How old was that child? Not more than nine years? I always have time to see justice done.’ His face was cold and vengeful. It was clear to see that he had recovered all his former mettle. I knew better than to argue further.</p>

    <p>The image of the little girl was still strong and clear in my mind. I joined him and we picked up the trail again. Now, with the two of us cooperating, we went forward even more swiftly.</p>

    <p>Tanus and I had tracked gazelle and oryx, and even lion, in this fashion and we had both become adept at this esoteric art. We worked as a team, running on each side of the spurs that our quarry had left, and signalling every twist or change in it to each other. Very soon our quarry reached a rough track that led eastward from the river and still deeper into the desert. They had joined it, and made our task of catching up with them that much simpler.</p>

    <p>It was almost noon, and our water-bottles were empty when at last we spotted them far ahead. There were five of them, and the donkey. It was clear that they had not expected to be followed deep into the desert which was their fastness, and they were moving carelessly. They had not even taken the trouble to cover then- back-trail.</p>

    <p>Tanus pulled me down behind the shelter of a rock while we caught our breath, and he growled at me, ‘We’ll circle out ahead of them. I want to see their faces.’</p>

    <p>He jumped up and led me in a wide detour out to one side of the track. We overtook the band of Shrikes, but well beyond then- line of sight. Then we cut in again to meet the track ahead of them. Tanus had a soldier’s eye for ground, and set up the ambuscade unerringly.</p>

    <p>We heard them coining from afar, the clatter of the don-key’s hooves and the sing-song of their voices. While we waited for them, I had the first opportunity to contemplate the prudence of my decision to follow along so unquestion-ingly. When the party of Shrikes at last came into view I was convinced that I had been over-hasty. They were as murderous-looking a bunch of ruffians as I had ever laid eyes upon, and I was armed only with my little jewelled dagger.</p>

    <p>Just short of where we lay, the tall, bearded Bedouin who was obviously their leader stopped suddenly, and ordered one of the men who followed him to unload the water-skin from the donkey. He drank first and then passed it on to the others. My throat closed in sympathy as I watched them swallow down the precious stuff.</p>

    <p>‘By Horus, look at the stains of the women’s blood on their robes. I wish I had Lanata with me now,’ Tanus whispered, as we crouched amongst the rocks. ‘I could put an arrow through that one’s belly and drain the water from him like beer from the vat.’ Then he laid a hand on my arm. ‘Don’t move until I do, do you hear me? I want no heroics from you now, mind.’ I nodded vigorously, and felt not the slightest inclination to protest against these very reasonable instructions.</p>

    <p>The Shrikes came on again directly to where we waited. They were all heavily armed. The Bedouin walked ahead. His sword was strapped between his shoulder-blades, but with the handle protruding up over his left shoulder, ready to hand. He had the cowl of his woollen cloak drawn over his head to protect him from the fierce sunlight. It impaired his side-vision and he did not notice us as he passed close in front of us.</p>

    <p>Two others followed him closely, one of them leading the donkey. The last two sauntered along behind the animal, engrossed in a listless squabble over a piece of gold jewellery that they had taken from the murdered woman. All their weapons were sheathed, except for the short, bronze-headed stabbing spears carried by the last pair.</p>

    <p>Tanus let them all pass, and then he stood up quietly and moved in. behind the last two men in the column. He appeared to move casually, as the leopard does, but it was in reality only a breath before he swung his sword at the neck of the man on the right.</p>

    <p>Although I had intended backing Tanus up to the full, somehow my good intentions had not been translated into action, and I still crouched behind my comforting rock. I justified myself with the thought that I would probably only have hindered him if I had followed him too closely.</p>

    <p>I had never watched Tanus kill a man before. Although I knew that it was his vocation and that he had, over the years, had every opportunity to hone these gruesome skills, still I was astonished by his virtuosity. As he struck, his victim’s head leapt from its shoulders like a desert spring-hare from its burrow, and the decapitated trunk actually took another step before the legs buckled under it. As the blow reached the limit of its arc, Tanus smoothly reversed the stroke. With the same movement he struck back-handed at the next brigand. The second neck severed just as cleanly. The head toppled off and fell free, while the carcass slumped forward with the blood fountaining high in the air.</p>

    <p>The splash of blood and the weighty thump-thump of the two disembodied heads striking the rocky earth alerted the other three Shrikes. They spun about in alarm, and for a moment stared in bewildered disbelief at the sudden carnage in their ranks. Then with a wild shout they drew their swords and rushed at Tanus in a body. Rather than retreating before them, Tanus charged them ferociously, splitting them apart. He swung to face the man he had isolated from his mates, and his thrust ripped a bloody flesh-wound down the side of his chest. The man squealed and reeled backwards. But before Tanus was able to finish him off, the other two fell upon him from behind. Tanus was forced to spin round to face them, and bronze clashed on bronze as he stopped their charge. He held them off at sword’s-length, engaging first one and then the other, until the lightly wounded man recovered and came at him from his rear.</p>

    <p>‘Behind you!’ I yelled at him, and he whipped round only just in time to catch the thrust on his own blade. Instantly the other two were upon him again, and he was forced to give ground in order to defend himself from all sides. His swordsmanship was breathtaking to watch. So swift was his blade that it seemed that he had erected a glittering wall of bronze around himself against which the blows of his enemies clattered ineffectually.</p>

    <p>Then I realized that Tanus was tiring. The sweat streamed from his body in the heat, and his features were contorted with the effort. The long weeks of wine and debauchery had taken their toll of what had once been his limitless strength and stamina.</p>

    <p>He fell back before the next rush with which the bearded Bedouin drove at him, until he pressed his back to one of the boulders on the opposite side of the track from where I still crouched helplessly. With the rock to cover his back, all three of his attackers were forced to come at him from the front. But this was no real respite. Their attack was relentless. Led by the Bedouin, they howled like a pack of wild dogs as they bayed him, and Tanus’ right arm tired and moved slower.</p>

    <p>The spear carried by the first man whom Tanus had beheaded had fallen in the middle of the track. I realized that I must do something immediately if I were not to watch Tanus hacked down before my eyes. With a huge effort I gathered up my slippery courage, and crept from my hiding-place. The Shrikes had forgotten all about me in their eagerness for the kill. I reached the spot where the spear lay without any one of them noticing me, and I snatched it up. With the solid weight of the weapon in my hands, all my lost courage came flooding back.</p>

    <p>The Bedouin was the most dangerous of the three of Tanus’ adversaries, and he was also the closest to me. His back was towards me, and his whole attention was on. the unequal duel. I levelled the spear and rushed at him.</p>

    <p>The kidneys are the most vulnerable target in the human back. With my knowledge of anatomy, I could aim my thrust exactly. The spear-point went in a finger’s-width to one side of the spinal column, all the way in. The broad spear-head opened a gaping wound, and skewered his right kidney with a surgeon’s precision. The Bedouin stiffened and froze like a temple statue, instantly paralysed by my thrust. Then, as I viciously twisted the blade in his flesh the way Tanus had taught me, mincing his kidney to pulp, the sword fell from his fist and he collapsed with such a dreadful cry that his comrades were distracted enough to give Tanus his chance.</p>

    <p>Tanus’ next thrust took one of them in the centre of his chest, and despite his exhaustion it still had sufficient power in it to fly cleanly through the man’s torso and for the blood-smeared point to protrude a hand-span from between his shoulder-blades. Before Tanus was able to clear his blade from the clinging embrace of live flesh and to kill the last Shrike, the survivor spun round and ran.</p>

    <p>Tanus took a few paces after him, then gasped, ‘I’m all done in. After him, Taita, don’t let that murderous jackal get away.’</p>

    <p>There are very few men that can outrun me. Tanus is the only one I know of, but he has to be on top form to do it. I put my foot in the centre of the Bedouin’s back and held him down as I jerked the spearhead out of his flesh, and then I went after the last Shrike.</p>

    <p>I caught him before he had gone two hundred paces, and I was running so lightly that he did not hear me coming up behind him. With the edge of the spear-head I slashed the tendon in the back of his heel, and he went down sprawling. The sword flew out of his hand. As he lay on his back kicking and screaming at me, I danced around him, pricking him with the point of the spear, goading him into position for a good clean killing thrust.</p>

    <p>‘Which of the women did you enjoy the best?’ I asked him, as I stabbed him in the thigh. ‘Was it the mother, with her big belly, or was it the little girl? Was she tight enough for you?’</p>

    <p>‘Please spare me!’ he screamed. ‘I did nothing. It was the others. Don’t kill me!’</p>

    <p>“There is dried blood on the front of your kilt,’ I said, and I stabbed him in the stomach, but not too deeply. ‘Did the child scream as loudly as you do now?’ I asked.</p>

    <p>As he rolled over into a ball to protect his stomach, I stabbed him in the spine, by a lucky chance finding the gap between the vertebrae. Instantly he was paralysed from the waist down, and I stepped back from him.</p>

    <p>‘Very well,’ I said. ‘You ask me not to kill you, and I won’t. It would be too good for you.’</p>

    <p>I turned away and walked back to join Tanus. The maimed Shrike dragged himself a little way after me, his paralysed legs slithering after him like a fisherman dragging a pair of dead carp. Then the effort was too much and he collapsed in a whimpering heap. Although it was past noon, the sun still had enough heat in it to kill him before it set.</p>

    <p>Tanus looked at me curiously as I came back to join him. “There is a savage streak in you that I never suspected before.’ He shook his head in wonder. ‘You never fail to amaze me.’</p>

    <p>He pulled the water-skin from the back of the donkey and offered it to me, but I shook my head. ‘You first You need it more than I do.’</p>

    <p>He drank, his eyes tightly closed with the pleasure of it, and then gasped, ‘By the sweet breath of Isis, you are right I am soft as an old woman. Even that little piece of sword-play nearly finished me.’ Then he looked around at the scattered corpses, and grinned with satisfaction. ‘But all in all, not a bad start on Pharaoh’s business.’</p>

    <p>‘It was the poorest of beginnings,’ I contradicted him, and when he crooked an eyebrow at me I went on, ‘We should have kept at least one of them alive to lead us to the Shrikes’ nest. Even that one’, I gestured towards the dying man lying out there amongst the rocks, ‘is too far-gone to be of any use to us. It was my fault. I allowed my anger to get the better of me. We won’t make the same mistake again.’</p>

    <p>We were halfway back to where we had left the bodies of the murdered family before my true nature reasserted itself, and I began bitterly to regret my callous and brutal treatment of the maimed brigand.</p>

    <p>‘After all, he was a human being, as we are,’ I told Tanus, and he snorted.</p>

    <p>‘He was an animal, a rabid jackal, and you did a fine job. You have mourned him far too long. Forget him. Tell me, instead, why we must make this detour back to look at dead men, instead of heading straight for Kratas’ camp.’</p>

    <p>‘I need the husband’s body.’ I would say no more until we stood over the mutilated corpse. The pathetic relic was already stinking in the heat The vultures had left very little flesh on the bones.</p>

    <p>‘Look at that hair,’ I told Tanus. ‘Who else do you know with a bush’ like that?’ For a moment he looked puzzled, and then he grinned and ran his fingers through his own dense ringlets.</p>

    <p>‘Help me load him on the donkey,’ I ordered. ‘Kratas can take him into Karnak to the morticians for embalming. We’ll buy him a good funeral and a fine tomb with your name on the walls. Then, by sunset tomorrow, all of Thebes will know that Tanus, Lord Harrab perished in the desert, and was half-eaten by the birds.’</p>

    <p>‘If Lostris hears of it?’ Tanus looked worried.</p>

    <p>Til send a warning letter to her. The advantage we will win by letting the world believe you dead will far outweigh any risk of alarming my mistress.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">KRATAS WAS CAMPED AT THE FIRST oasis on the caravan road to the Red Sea, less than a day’s march from Karnak. He had with him a hundred men of the Blue Crocodile Guards, all of them carefully selected, as I had commanded. Tanus and I reached the encampment in the middle of the night. We had travelled hard and were close to exhaustion. We fell on our sleeping-mats beside the camp-fire and slept until dawn.</p>

    <p>At first light, Tanus was up and mingling with his men. Their delight at having him back was transparent. The officers embraced him and the men cheered him, and grinned with pride as he greeted each of them by name.</p>

    <p>At breakfast Tanus gave Kratas instructions to take the putrefying corpse back to Karnak for burial and to make certain that the news of his death was the gossip of all Thebes. I gave Kratas a letter for my Lady Lostris. He would find a trustworthy messenger to carry it up-river to Elephantine.</p>

    <p>Kratas selected an escort of ten men, and they prepared to set off with the donkey and its odorous burden, back towards the Nile and Thebes.</p>

    <p>‘Try to catch up with us on the road to the sea. If you cannot, then you’ll find us camped at the oasis of Gebel Nagara. We will wait for you there,’ Tanus shouted after him, as the detachment trotted out ofVhe encampment. ‘And remember to bring Lanata, my bow, when you return!’</p>

    <p class="Chap">NO SOONER WAS KRATAS OUT OF SIGHT beyond the first rise on the westerly road than Tanus formed up the rest of the regiment and led us away in the opposite direction along the caravan road towards the sea.</p>

    <p>The caravan road from the banks of the river Nile to the shores of the Red Sea was long and hard. A large, unwieldy caravan usually took twenty days to make the journey. We covered the distance in four days, for Tanus pushed us in a series of forced marches. At the outset, he and I were probably the only ones of all the company who were not in superb physical condition. However, by the time we reached Gebel Nagara, Tanus had burned the excess fat off his frame and sweated out the last poisons from the wine jar. He was once again lean and hard.</p>

    <p>As for myself, it was the first time that I had ever made a forced march with a company of the guards. For the first few days I suffered all the torments of thirst and aching muscles, of blistered feet and exhaustion that the Ka of a dead man must be forced to endure on the road to the underworld. However, my pride would not allow me to fall behind, apart from the facMjiat to do so in this wild and savage landscape would have meant certain death. To my surprise and pleasure, I found that after the first few days, it became easier and easier to keep my place in the ranks of trotting warriors.</p>

    <p>Along the way, we passed two large caravans moving towards the Nile, with the donkeys bow-legged under their heavy loads of trade goods, and escorts of heavily armed men far surpassing in number the merchants and their’ retainers who made up the rest of the company. No caravan was safe from the depredations of the Shrikes unless it was protected by a force of mercenaries such as these, or unless the merchants were prepared to pay the crippling toll money that the Shrikes demanded to allow them free passage.</p>

    <p>When we met these strangers, Tanus pulled his shawl over his head to mask his face and hide that golden bush of hair. He was too distinctive a figure to risk being recognized and his continued existence being reported in Karnak. We’did not respond to the greetings and questions that were flung at us by these other travellers, but ran past them in aloof silence without even glancing in their direction.</p>

    <p>When we were still a day’s march from the coast, we left the main caravan route and swung away southwards, following an ancient disused track that had been shown to me some years previously by one of the wild Bedouin whom I had befriended. The wells at Gebel Nagara lay on this old route to the sea, and were seldom visited by humans these days, only by the Bedouin and the desert bandits, if you can call these human.</p>

    <p>By the time we reached the wells, I was as slim and physically fit as I had ever been in my life, but I lamented the lack of a mirror, for I was convinced that this new energy and force that I felt within myself must be reflected in my features, and that my beauty must be enhanced by it. I would have welcomed the opportunity to admire it myself. However, there seemed to be no dearth of others to admire it in my place. At the camp-fire in the evenings, many a prurient glance was flashed in my direction, and I received more than a few sly offers from my companions, for even such an elite fighting corps as the guards was contaminated by the new sexual licence that permeated our society.</p>

    <p>I kept my dagger beside me in the night and when I pricked the first uninvited visitor to my sleeping-mat with the needle-point, his yells caused much hilarity amongst the others. After that, I was spared any further unwelcome attentions.</p>

    <p>Even once we had reached the wells, Tanus would allow us little rest. While we waited for Kratas to catch up, he kept his men exercising at arms, and at competitions of archery and wrestling and running. I was pleased to see that Kratas had chosen these men strictly in accordance with my instructions to him. There was not a single hulking brute amongst them. Apart from Tanus himself, they were all small, agile men aptly suited to the role that I planned for them.</p>

    <p>Kratas arrived only two days behind us. Taking into account his return to Karnak and the time taken up by the tasks that Tanus had set for him there, this meant that he must have travelled even more swiftly than we had done.</p>

    <p>‘What held you up?’ Tanus greeted him. ‘Did you find a willing maid on the way?’</p>

    <p>‘I had two heavy burdens to carry,’ Kratas replied, as they embraced. ‘Your bow, and the hawk seal. I am glad to be rid of both of them.’ He handed over both the weapon and the statuette with a grin, delighted as ever to be back with Tanus.</p>

    <p>Tanus immediately took Lanata out into the desert. I went with him and helped him stalk close to a herd of gazelle. With these fleet little creatures racing and leaping across the plain, it was an extraordinary sight to watch Tanus bowl over a dozen of them at full run with as many arrows. That night, as we feasted on grilled livers and fillets of gazelle, we discussed the next stage of my plan.</p>

    <p>In the morning we left Kratas in command of the guards, and Tanus and I set out alone for the coast. It was only half a day’s travel to the small fishing village which was our goal, and at noon we topped the last rise and looked down from the hills on to the glittering expanse of the sea spread below us. From this height we could see clearly the dark outline ofthe coral reefs beneath the turquoise waters.</p>

    <p>As soon as we entered the village, Tanus called for the headman, and so apparent from his bearing was Tanus’ importance and authority, that the old man came at a run. When Tanus showed him the hawk seal, he fell to the earth in obeisance, as though it were Pharaoh himself who stood before him, and beat his head upon the ground with such force that I feared he might do himself serious injury. When I lifted him to his feet once more, he led us to the finest lodgings in the village, his own filthy hovel, and turned his numerous family out to make room for us.</p>

    <p>Once we had eaten a bowl of the fish stew that our host provided and drunk a cup of the delicious palm wine, Tanus and I went down to the beach of dazzling white sand and bathed away the sweat and the dust of the desert in the warm waters of the lagoon that was enclosed by the jagged barricade of coral that lay parallel to the shore. Behind us the harsh mountains, devoid of the faintest green tinge of growing things, thrust up into the aching blue desert sky.</p>

    <p>Sea, mountains and sky combined in a symphony of grandeur that stunned the senses. However, I had little time to appreciate it all, for the fishing fleet was returning. Five small dilapidated vessels with sails of woven palm-fronds were coming in through the pass in the reef. So great was the load of fish that each of them carried, that they seemed in danger of foundering before they could reach the beach.</p>

    <p>I am fascinated by all the natural bounty that the gods provide for us, and I examined the catch avidly as it was thrown out upon the beach, and questioned the fishermen as to each of the hundred different species. The pile of fish formed a glittering treasure of rainbow colours, and I wished that I had my scrolls and paint-pots to record it all.</p>

    <p>This interlude was too brief. As soon as the catch was unloaded, I embarked on one of the tiny vessels that stank so abundantly of its vocation, and waved back at Tanus on the beach as we put out through the pass in the reef. He was to remain here until I returned with the equipment that we needed for the next part of my plan. Once again, I did not want him to be recognized where I was going. His job now was to prevent any of the fishermen or their families from sneaking away into the desert to a secret meeting with the Shrikes, to report the presence in their village of a golden-headed lord who bore the hawk seal.</p>

    <p>The tiny vessel threw up her bows at the first strong scent of the sea, and the helmsman tacked across the wind and headed her up into the north, running parallel to that dun and awful coast. We had but a short way to go, and before nightfall the helmsman pointed over the bows at the clustered stone buildings of the port of Safaga on the distant shore-line.</p>

    <p class="Chap">FOR A THOUSAND YEARS SAFAGA HAD been the entrepot for all trade coming into the Upper Kingdom from the East. Even as I stood in the bows of our tiny craft, I could make out the shapes of other much larger vessels on the northern horizon as they came and went between Safaga and the</p>

    <p>Arabian ports on the eastern shore of the narrow sea.</p>

    <p>It was dark by the time that I stepped ashore on the beach at Safaga, and nobody seemed to remark my arrival. I knew exactly where I was going, for I had visited the port regularly on Lord Intefs nefarious business. At this hour the streets were almost deserted, but the taverns were packed. I made my way swiftly to the home of Tiamat the merchant. ; Tiamat was a rich man and his home the largest in the old town. An armed slave barred the door to me.</p>

    <p>‘Tell your master that the surgeon from Karnak who saved his leg for him is here,’ I ordered, and Tiamat himself limped out to greet me. He was taken aback when he saw my clerical disguise, but had the good sense not to remark on it, nor to mention my name in front of the slave. He drew me into his walled garden, and as soon as we were alone he exclaimed, ‘Is it really you, Taita? I heard that you had been murdered by the Shrikes at Elephantine.’</p>

    <p>He was a portly, middle-aged man, with an open, intelligent face and a shrewd mind. Some years previously he had been carried in to me on a litter. A party of travellers had found him beside the road, where he had been left for dead after his caravan had been pillaged by the Shrikes. I had stitched him together, and even managed to save the leg that had already mortified by the time I first saw it. However, he would always walk with a limp.</p>

    <p>‘I am delighted to see that the reports of your death are premature,’ he chuckled, and clapped his hands to have his slaves bring me a cup of cool sherbet and a plate of figs and honeyed dates.</p>

    <p>After a decent interval of polite conversation, he asked quietly, ‘Is there anything I can do for you? I owe you my life. You have only to ask. My home is your home. All I have is yours.’</p>

    <p>‘I am on the king’s business,’ I told him, and drew out the hawk seal from under my tunic.</p>

    <p>His expression became grave. ‘I acknowledge the seal of Pharaoh. But it was not necessary to show it to me. Ask what you will of me. I cannot refuse you.’</p>

    <p>He listened to all I had to say without another word, and when I had finished, he sent for his bailiff and gave him his orders in front of me. Before he sent the man away, he turned to me and said, ‘Is there anything that I have forgotten? Anything else you need at all?’</p>

    <p>‘Your generosity is without limits,’ I told him. ‘However, there is one other thing. I long for my writing materials.’</p>

    <p>He turned back to the bailiff. ‘See to it that there are scrolls and brushes and ink-pot in one of the packs.’</p>

    <p>After the bailiff had left, we sat on talking for half the night. Tiamat stood at the centre of the busiest trading route in the Upper Kingdom, and heard every rumour and whisper from the farthest reaches of the empire, and from beyond the sea. I learned as much in those few hours in his garden as I would in a month in the palace at Elephantine.</p>

    <p>‘Do you still pay your ransom to the Shrikes to allow your caravans through?’ I asked, and he shrugged with resignation.</p>

    <p>‘After what they did to my leg, what option do I have? Each season then” demands become more exorbitant. I must pay over one-quarter of the value of my goods to them as soon as the caravan leaves Safaga, and half my profits once The goods are sold in Thebes. Soon they will beggar us all, and grass will grow on the caravan roads, and the trade of the kingdom will wither and die.’</p>

    <p>‘How do you make these payments?’ I asked. ‘Who determines the amount, and who collects them?’</p>

    <p>‘They have then- spies here in the port. They watch every cargo that is unloaded, and they know what each caravan carries when it leaves Safaga. Before it even reaches the mountain pass, it will be met by one of the robber chieftains who will demand the ransom they have set.’</p>

    <p>It was long past midnight before Tiamat called a slave to light me to the chamber he had set aside for me.</p>

    <p>‘You will be gone before I rise tomorrow.’ Tiamat embraced me. ‘Farewell, my good friend. My debt to you is not yet paid in full. Call upon me again, whenever you have need.’</p>

    <p>The same slave woke me before dawn, and led me down to the seafront in the darkness. A fine trading vessel of Tiamat’s fleet was moored inside the reef. The captain weighed anchor as soon as I came aboard.</p>

    <p>In the middle of the morning we crept in through the pass in the coral and dropped anchor in front of the little fishing village where Tanus stood on the beach to welcome me.</p>

    <p class="Chap">DURING MY ABSENCE TANUS HAD MANAGED to gather together six decrepit donkeys, and the sailors from Tiamat’s ship waded ashore carrying the bales that we had brought with us from Safaga, and loaded them on to these miserable creatures. Tanus and I left the captain of the trading vessel with strict orders to await our return, then, leading the string of donkeys, we headed back, inland towards the wells at Gebel Nagara.</p>

    <p>Kratas’ men had obviously suffered the heat and the sand-flies and the boredom with poor grace, for they accorded us a welcome that was out of keeping with the period that we had been absent. Tanus ordered Kratas to parade them. The ranks of warriors watched as I unpacked the first bale that we had brought in on the donkey train. Almost immediately their interest gave way to mild amusement as I laid out the costume of a slave girl. In its turn, this was replaced by a buzz of speculation and argument as the bales yielded up a further seventy-nine* complete female costumes.</p>

    <p>Kratas and two of his officers helped me place one of these on the sand in front of each guardsman, and then Tanus gave the order: ‘Disrobe! Put on the dress in front of you!’ There was a roar of protest and incredulous hilarity, and k was only when Kratas and his officers passed down the ranks with assumed expressions of sternness to reinforce the order, that they began to obey it.</p>

    <p>Unlike our women who dress but lightly and often leave their bosom bared and their legs free and naked, the women of Assyria wear skirts that sweep the ground and sleeves that cover their arms to the wrist. For reasons of misplaced modesty they even veil their faces when they walk abroad, although perhaps these restrictions are placed upon them by the possessive jealousy of their menfolk. Then again there is a wide difference between the sunny land of Egypt and those more sombre climes where water falls from the sky and turns solid white upon the moun-taintops, and the winds chill the flesh and the bones of men like death.</p>

    <p>Once they had weathered the first shock of seeing each other in’this outlandish apparel, the nien entered into the spirit of the moment. Soon there were eighty veiled slave girls prancing and mincing about in the long skirts that reached to their ankles, tweaking each other’s buttocks and casting exaggerated sheep’s eyes at Tanus and his officers.</p>

    <p>The officers could no longer maintain their gravity. Perhaps it is because of my peculiar circumstances that I have always found the spectacle of men dressed as women to be vaguely repulsive, but it is strange how few other men share my feelings of distaste, and it needs only some hairy ruffian to don a skirt to reduce his audience to a state of incontinence.</p>

    <p>In the midst of this uproar, I congratulated myself that I had insisted that Kratas choose only the smallest and slimmest men from the squadron. Looking them over now, I was certain that they would be able to carry through the deception. They would need only a little schooling in feminine deportment.</p>

    <p class="Chap">THE FOLLOWING MORNING OUR STRANGE caravan passed through the little fishing village and wound its way down on to the beach, where the trading vessel waited. Kratas and eight of his officers made up the escort. Complete lack of any armed escort for such a valuable consignment would surely have aroused suspicion. Nine armed men dressed in the motley garb of mercenaries would be sufficient to allay this, but would not deter a large raiding party of Shrikes.</p>

    <p>At the head of the caravan marched Tanus, dressed in the rich robes and beaded head-dress of a wealthy merchant from beyond the Euphrates river. His beard had grown out densely, and I had curled it for him into those tight ringlets that the Assyrians favoured. Many of these Asians, particularly those from the high mountainous regions further north, have the same complexion and skin coloration as Tanus, so he looked the part I had chosen for him.</p>

    <p>I followed close behind him. I had overcome my aversion to wearing female garb, and donned the long skirts and veil, together with the gaudy jewellery of an Assyrian wife. I was determined not to be recognized when I returned to Safaga.</p>
  </div>

  <a id="section_4"></a>

  

  <div>
    <p>The voyage was enlivened by the sea-sickness of most of the slave girls and not a few of the officers, for they were accustomed to sail on the placid waters of the great river. At one stage so many of them were lining the rail to make their offerings to the gods of the sea, that the ship took on a distinct list.</p>

    <p>We were all relieved to step on to the beach at Safaga, where we caused much excitement The Assyrian girls were famous for their skills on the love couch. It was said that some of them were capable of tricks that could bring a thousand-year-old mummy back to life. It was obvious to those who watched us come ashore that behind the veils our slave girls must be images of feminine loveliness. A shrewd Asian merchant would not transport his wares so far and at such expense, unless he was certain of a good price in the slave-markets on the Nile.</p>

    <p>One of the Safaga merchants approached Tanus immediately and offered to buy the entire bevy of girls on the spot, and spare him the onerous journey across the desert with them. Tanus waved ffim away with a scornful chuckle.</p>

    <p>‘Have you been warned of the perils of the journey that you intend making?’ the merchant insisted. ‘Before you reach the Nile, you will be forced to pay a ransom for your safe passage that will eat up most of your profits.’</p>

    <p>‘Who will force me to pay?’ Tanus demanded. ‘I pay only what I owe.’</p>

    <p>“There are those who guard the road,’ the merchant warned him. ‘And even though you pay what they demand, there is no certainty that they will let you pass unharmed, especially with such tempting goods as you have with you. The vultures on the road to the Nile are so fat from feeding on the carcasses of stubborn merchants that they can hardly fly. Sell to me now at a good profit?’</p>

    <p>‘I have armed guards’, Tanus indicated Kratas and his small squad, ‘who will be a match for any robbers we may meet.’ And the onlookers who had listened to the exchange tittered and nudged each other at the boast.</p>

    <p>The merchant shrugged. ‘Very well, my brave friend. On my next journey through the desert, I will look for your skeleton beside the road. I will recognize you by that blustering red beard of yours.’</p>

    <p>As he had promised me he would, Tiamat had forty donkeys waiting for us. Twenty of them were laden with filled water-skins, and the remainder with pack-saddles to carry the bales and bundles that we brought ashore from the trading ship.</p>

    <p>I was anxious that we should spend as little time as possible in the port, under all those prying eyes. It would take only a single lapse by one of the slave girls to reveal his true gender, and we would be undone. Kratas and his escort hurried them through the narrow streets, keeping the bystanders at a distance, and making certain that the slave girls kept thek veils in place and their eyes downcast, and that none of them responded in gruff masculine tones to the ribald comment that followed us, until we were out into the open country beyond the town.</p>

    <p>We camped that first night still within sight of Safaga. Although I did not anticipate an attack until we were beyond the first mountain pass, I was certain that we were already being watched by the spies of the Shrikes.</p>

    <p>While it was still light, I made sure that our slave girls conducted themselves as women, that they kept their faces and bodies covered, and that when they went into the nearby wadi to attend to nature’s demands, they squatted in decorous fashion and did not uncouthly spray their water while standing.</p>

    <p>It was only after darkness fell that Tanus ordered the bundles carried by the donkeys to be opened and the weapons they contained to be issued to the slave girls. Each of mem slept with his bow and his sword concealed under his sleeping-mat.</p>

    <p>Tanus posted double sentries around the camp. After we had inspected them and made sure that they were all well placed and fully alert, Tanus and I slipped away, and in the darkness returned to the port of Safaga. I led him through the dark streets to the house of Tiamat. The merchant was expecting our arrival, and had a meal laid ready to welcome us. I could see that he was excited to meet Tanus.</p>

    <p>‘Your fame proceeds you, Lord Harrab. I knew your father. He was a man indeed,’ he greeted Tanus. ‘Although I have heard persistent rumours that you died in die desert not a week since, and that even at this moment your body lies with the morticians on the west bank of the Nile, undergoing the ritual forty days of the embalming process, you are welcome in my humble house.’</p>

    <p>While we enjoyed the feast he provided, Tanus questioned him at length on all he knew of the Shrikes, and Tiamat answered him freely and openly.</p>

    <p>At last Tanus glanced at me and I nodded. Tanus turned back to Tiamat and said, ‘You have been a generous friend to us, and yet we have been less than honest with you. This was from necessity, for it was of vital importance that no one should guess at our real purpose in mis endeavour. Now I will tell you that it is my purpose to smash the Shrikes and deliver their leaders up to Pharaoh’s justice and wrath.’</p>

    <p>Tiamat smiled and stroked his beard. ‘This comes as no great surprise to me,’ he said, ‘for I have heard of the charge mat Pharaoh placed upon you at the festival of Osiris. That and your patent interest in those murderous bandits left little doubt in my mind. I can say only that I will sacrifice to the gods for your success.’</p>

    <p>‘To succeed, I will need your help again,’ Tanus told him.</p>

    <p>‘You have only to ask.’</p>

    <p>‘Do you think that the Shrikes are as yet aware of our caravan?’</p>

    <p>‘All of Safaga is talking about you,’ Tiamat replied. ‘Yours is the richest cargo that has arrived this season. Eighty beautiful slave girls will be worth at least a thousand gold rings each in Karnak.’ He chuckled and shook his head at the joke. ‘You can be certain that the Shrikes already know all about you. I saw at least three of their spies in the crowd at the waterfront watching you. You can expect them to meet you and make their demands even before you reach the first pass.’</p>

    <p>When we rose to take our leave, he walked with us as far as his own door. ‘May all the gods attend your endeavours. Not only Pharaoh, but every living soul in the entire kingdom will be in your debt if you can stamp out this terrible scourge that threatens to destroy our very civilization, and drive us all back into the age of barbarism.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">IT WAS STILL COOL AND DARK THE FOLLOWING morning when die column started out. Tanus, with Lanata slung over his shoulder, was at die head of die caravan, widi myself, in all my womanly grace and beauty, following him closely. Behind us the donkeys were harnessed hi single file, moving nose to tail down the middle of die well-beaten track. The slave girls were hi double columns on die outer flanks of the file of donkeys. Their weapons were concealed in die packs upon the backs of die animals. Any of die men needed only to reach out to lay a hand upon die hilt of his sword.</p>

    <p>Kratas had split his escort into diree squads of six men each, commanded by Astes, Remrem and himself. Astes and Remrem were warriors of renown and more than deserving of dieir own commands. However, bodi of diem had, on numerous occasions, refused promotion in order to remain with Tanus. That was die quality of loyalty mat Tanus inspired in all who served under him. I could not help thinking yet again what a pharaoh he would have made.</p>

    <p>The escorts now slouched along beside die column, making every attempt to forsake their military bearing. It would seem to die spies who were certainly watching us from die hills that they were diere solely to prevent any of die slaves from escaping. In north diey were fully occupied widi preventing their charges from breaking into marching step and sounding off a chorus of one of die rowdy regimental songs.</p>

    <p>‘You diere, Kernit!’ I heard Remrem challenge one of diem. ‘Don’t take such long steps, man, and swing that fat arse of yours a little! Try to make yourself alluring.’</p>

    <p>‘Give me a kiss, captain,’ Kernit called back, ‘and I’ll do anything you say.’</p>

    <p>The heat was rising, and the mirage was beginning to make die rocks dance. Tanus turned back to me. ‘Soon I will call our first rest-stop. One cup of water for each?’</p>

    <p>‘Good husband,’ I interrupted him, ‘your friends have arrived. Look ahead!’</p>

    <p>Tanus turned back, and instinctively gripped die stock of die great bow that hung at his side. ‘And what fine fellows they are, too!’</p>

    <p>At that moment our column was winding through the first foothills below the desert plateau. On either hand we were walled in by the steep sides of the rocky hills. Now three men stood in the track ahead of us. The one who led them was a tall, menacing figure swathed in the woollen robe of the desert traveller, but his head was bared His skin was very dark, and deeply pitted with the scars of the smallpox. He had a nose that was hooked like the beak of a vulture, and his right eye was an opaque jelly from the blind-worm that burrows deep into the eyeball of its victims.</p>

    <p>‘I know the one-eyed villain,’ I said softly, so that Tanus alone could hear. ‘His name is Shufti. He is the most notorious of the barons of the Shrikes. Be wary of him. The lion is a gentle beast compared to this one.’</p>

    <p>Tanus gave no sign of having heard me, but lifted his right hand to show that it held no weapon, and called out cheerfully, ‘May all your days be scented with jasmine, gentle traveller, and may a loving wife welcome you at your own front door when at last your journey is done.’</p>

    <p>‘May your water-skins stay filled and cool breezes fan your brow when you cross the Thirsty Sands,’ Shufti called back, and he smiled. That smile was fiercer than a leopard’s snarl, and his single eye glared horribly.</p>

    <p>‘You are kind, my noble lord,’ Tanus thanked him. ‘I would like to offer you a meal and the hospitality of my camp, but I pray your indulgence. We have a long road before us, and we must pass on.’</p>

    <p>‘Just a little more of your time, my fine Assyrian.’ Shufti moved forward to block the path. ‘I have something which you need, if you and your caravan are ever, to reach the Nile in safety.’ He held up a small object.</p>

    <p>‘Ah, a charm!’ Tanus exclaimed. ‘You are a magician, perhaps? What manner of charm is this you are offering me?’</p>

    <p>‘A feather.’ Shufti was still smiling. “The feather of a shrike.’</p>

    <p>Tanus smiled, as though to humour a child. ‘Very well then, give me this feather and I’ll delay you no longer.’</p>

    <p>‘A gift for a. gift. You must give me something in return,’ Shufti told him. ‘Give me twenty of your slaves. Then, when you return from Egypt, I will meet you on the road again and you will give me half the profits from the sale of the other sixty.’</p>

    <p>‘For a single feather?’ Tanus scoffed. “That sounds like a sorry bargain to me.’</p>

    <p>“This is no ordinary feather. It is a shrike’s feather,’ Shufti pointed out. ‘Are you so ill-informed that you have never heard of that bird?’</p>

    <p>‘Let me see this magical feather.’ Tanus walked towards him with his right hand outstretched, and Shufti came forward to meet him. At the same time Kratas, Remrem and Astes wandered up inquisitively, as though to examine the feather.</p>

    <p>Instead of taking the gift from his hand, suddenly Tanus seized Shufti’s wrist and twisted it up between his shoulder-blades. With a startled cry, Shufti fell to his knees and Tanus held him easily. At the same time Kratas and his men darted forward, taking the other two bandits by as much surprise as their chief. They knocked the weapons out of their hands, and dragged them to where Tanus stood.</p>

    <p>‘So, you little birds think to frighten Kaarik, the Assyrian, with your threats, do you? Yes, my fine vendor of feathers, I have heard of the Shrikes. I have heard that they are a flock of chattering, cowardly little fledglings, that make more noise than a flock of sparrows.’ He twisted Shufti’s arm more viciously, until the bandit yelled with pain and fell flat on his face. ‘Yes, I have heard of the Shrikes, but have you heard of Kaarik, the terrible?’ He nodded at Kratas, and quickly and efficiently they stripped the three Shrikes stark naked and pinned them spread-eagled upon the rocky earth.</p>

    <p>‘I want you to remember my name, and fly away like a good little shrike when next you hear it,’ Tanus told him, and nodded to Kratas again. Kratas flexed the lash of his slave-whip between his fingers. It was of the same type as Rasfer’s famous tool, whittled from the cured hide of a bull hippopotamus. Tanus held out his hand for it, and reluctantly Kratas handed it over to him.</p>

    <p>‘Don’t look so sad, slave-master,’ Tanus told him. ‘I’ll let you have your turn later. But Kaarik, the Assyrian, always takes the first spoonful from the pot.’</p>

    <p>Tanus slashed the whip back and forth through the air, and it whistled like the wing of a goose in flight. Shufti squirmed where he lay, and twisted his head around to hiss at Tanus, ‘You are mad, you Assyrian ox! Do you not. realize that I am a baron of the Shrike clan? You dare not do this to me?’ His naked back and buttocks were stippled with pox scars.</p>

    <p>Tanus lifted the whip on high, and then brought it down in a full-armed stroke with all his weight behind it. He laid a purple welt as fat as my forefinger across Shufti’s back. So intense was the pain of it that the bandit’s entire body convulsed and the ah- hissed out of his lungs, so that he could not scream. Tanus lifted the lash and then meticulously laid another ridged welt exactly parallel to the first, almost, but not quite, touching it. This time Shufti filled his lungs and let out a hoarse bellow, like a buffalo bull caught in a pitfall. Tanus ignored his struggles and his outraged roars, and worked on assiduously, laying on the strokes as though he were weaving a carpet.</p>

    <p>When at last he was done, his victim’s legs, buttocks and back were latticed with the fiery weals. Not one of the blows had overlaid another. The skin was intact and not a drop of blood had spilled out, but Shufti was no longer wriggling or screaming. He lay with his face in the dirt, his breath snoring in his throat, so that each exhalation raised a puff of dust. When Remrem and Kratas released him, he made no effort to sit up. He did not even stir.</p>

    <p>Tanus tossed the whip to Kratas. “The next one is yours, slave-master. Let us see whdt a pretty pattern you can tattoo on his back.’</p>

    <p>Kratas’ strokes hummed with power, but lacked the finesse that Tanus had demonstrated. Soon the bandit’s back was leaking like a flawed jar of red wine. The droplets of blood fell into the dust and rolled into tiny balls of mud.</p>

    <p>Sweating lightly, Kratas was satisfied at last, and he passed the whip to Astes as he indicated the last victim. ‘Give that one something to remind him of his manners, as well.’</p>

    <p>Astes had an even more rustic touch than Kratas. By the time he had finished, the last bandit’s back looked like a side of fresh beef that had been cut up by a demented butcher.</p>

    <p>Tanus signalled the caravan to move forward, towards the pass through the red rock mountains. We lingered a while beside the three naked men.</p>

    <p>At last Shufti stirred and lifted his head, and Tanus addressed him civilly. ‘And so, my friend, I beg leave of you. Remember my face, and step warily when you see it again.’ Tanus picked up the fallen shrike’s feather and tucked it into his headband. ‘I thank you for your gift. May all your nights be cradled in the arms of lovely ladies.’ He touched his heart and lips in the Assyrian gesture of farewell, and I followed him up the road after the departing caravan.</p>

    <p>I looked back before we dropped over the next rise. All three Shrikes were on their feet, supporting each other to remain upright. Even at this distance I could make out the expression on Shufti’s face. It was hatred distilled to its essence.</p>

    <p>‘Well, you have made certain that we will have every Shrike this side of the Nile upon us, the moment we take our first step beyond the pass,’ I told Kratas and his ruffians, and I could not have pleased them more, had I promised them a shipload of beer and pretty girls.</p>

    <p class="Chap">FROM THE CREST OF THE PASS WE looked back at the cool blue of the sea for the last time and then dropped down into that sweltering wilderness of rock and sand that stood between us and the Nile.</p>

    <p>As we moved forward, the heat came at us like a mortal enemy. It seemed to enter through our mouths and nostrils as we gasped for breath. It sucked the moisture from our bodies like a thief. It dried out our skin and cracked it until our lips burst open like over-ripe figs. The rocks beneath our feet were hot, as though fresh from the pot-maker’s kiln, and they scalded and blistered our feet, even through the leather soles of our sandals. It was impossible to continue the march during the hottest hours of the day. We lay in the flimsy shade of the linen tents that Tiamat had provided, and panted like hunting dogs after the chase.</p>

    <p>When the sun sank towards the jagged rock horizon, we went on. The desert around us was charged with such a brooding nameless menace that even the high spirits of the Blue Crocodile Guards were subdued. The long slow column wound like a maimed adder through the black rock outcrops and tawny lion-coloured dunes, following the ancient road along which countless other travellers had passed before us.</p>

    <p>When night fell at last, the sky came alive with such a dazzle of stars and the desert was lit so brightly that, from my place at the head of the caravan, I could recognize the shape of Kratas at the tail, although two hundred paces separated us. We marched on for half the night before Tanus gave the order to fall out. Then he had us up before dawn and we marched on until the heat-mirage dissolved the rocky outcrops around us and made the horizon swim so that it seemed to be moulded from melting pitch.</p>

    <p>We saw no other sign of life, except that once a troop of dog-headed baboons barked at us from the cliffs of a stark rock tableland as we passed below them, and the vultures soared so high in the hot blue sky that they appeared to be but dust motes swirling in slow and deliberate circles high above us.</p>

    <p>When we rested in the middle of the day the whirlwinds pirouetted and swayed with the peculiar grace of dancing houris across the plains, and the cupful of water that was our ration seemed to turn to steam in my mouth.</p>

    <p>‘Where are they?’ Kratas growled angrily. ‘By Seth’s sweaty scrotum, I hope these little birds will soon puff up their courage and come in to roost.’</p>

    <p>Although they were all tough veterans and inured to hardship and discomfort, nerves and tempers were wearing thin. Good comrades and old friends began to snarl at each other for no reason, and bicker over the water ration.</p>

    <p>‘Shufti is a cunning old dog,’ I told Tanup. ‘He will gather his forces and wait for us to come to him, rather than hurry to meet us. He will let us tire ourselves with the journey, and grow careless with our fatigue, before he strikes.’</p>

    <p>On the fifth day I knew that we were approaching the oasis of Gallala when I saw that the dark cliffs ahead of us were riddled with the caves of ancient tombs. Centuries ago, the oasis had supported a thriving city, but then an earthquake had shaken the hills and damaged the wells. The water had dwindled to a few seeping drops. Even though the wells had been dug deeper to reach the receding water, and the earthen steps reached down to where the surface of the water was always in shade, the city had died. The roofless walls stood forlorn in the silence, and lizards sunned themselves in the courtyards where rich merchants had once dallied with their harems.</p>

    <p>Our very first concern was to refill the water-skins. The voices of the men drawing water at the bottom of the well were distorted by the echoes in the deep shaft. While they were busy, Tanus and I made a swift tour of the ruined city. It was a lonely and melancholy place. In its centre was the dilapidated temple to the patron god of Gallala. The roof had fallen in and the walls were collapsing in places. It had but a single entrance through the crumbling gateway at the western end.</p>

    <p>‘This will do admirably,’ Tanus muttered as he strode across it, measuring it with his soldier’s eye for fortification and ambuscade. When I questioned him on his intentions, he smiled and shook his head. ‘Leave that part of it to me, -old friend. The fighting is my business.’</p>

    <p>As we stood at the centre of the temple I noticed the tracks of a troop of baboons in the dust at our feet, and I pointed them out to Tanus. “They must come to drink at the wells,’ I told him.</p>

    <p>That evening when we sat around the small, smoky fires of dried donkey dung in the ancient temple, we heard the baboons again, the old bull apes barking a challenge in the hills that surrounded the ruined city. Their voices boomed back and forth along the cliffs, and I nodded at Tanus across the fire. ‘Your friend, Shufti, has arrived at last. His scouts are in the hills up there watching us now. It is they who have alarmed the baboons.’</p>

    <p>‘I hope you are right. My blackguards are close to mutiny. They know mis is all your idea, and if you are wrong, I might have to give them your head or your backside to appease them,’ Tanus growled, and went to speak to Astes at the neighbouring cooking-fire.</p>

    <p>Swiftly a new mood infected the camp as they realized that the enemy was near. The scowls evaporated and the men grinned at each other in the firelight, as they surreptitiously tested the edges of the swords concealed beneath the sleeping-mats on which they sat. However, they were canny veterans and they went through the motions of normal caravan life, so as not to alert the watchers in the dark hills above us. At last we were all bundled on our mats, and the fires died down, but none of us slept. I could hear them coughing and fidgeting restlessly all around me in the dark. The long hours drew out, and through the open roof I watched the great constellations of the stars wheel in stately splendour overhead, but still the attack never came.</p>

    <p>Just before dawn, Tanus made his round of the sentries for the last time, and then, on his way back to his place beside the cooling ashes of last night’s fire, he stopped by my mat for a moment and whispered, ‘You and your friends the baboons, you deserve each other. All of you bark at shadows.’</p>

    <p>‘The Shrikes are here. I can smell them. The hills are full of them,’ I protested.</p>

    <p>‘All you can smell is the promise of breakfast,’ he grunted. He knows how I detest the suggestion that I am a glutton. Rather than reply to such callow humour, I went out into the darkness to relieve myself behind the nearest pfle of ruins.</p>

    <p>As I squatted there, a baboon barked again, the wild, booming cry shattering the preternatural silences of that last and darkest of the night-watches. I turned my head in that direction and heard, faint and faraway, the sound of metal strike rock, as though a nervous hand had dropped a dagger up there on the ridge, or a careless shield had brushed against a granite outcrop as an armed man hurried to take up his station before the dawn found him out.</p>

    <p>I smiled complacently to myself; there are few pleasures in my life compared to that of making Tanus eat his words. As I returned to my mat, I whispered to the men mat I passed, ‘Be ready. They are here,’ and I heard my warning passed on from mouth to sleepless mouth.</p>

    <p>Above me the stars began to fade away, and the dawn crept up on us as stealthily as a lioness stalking a herd of oryx. Then abruptly I heard a sentry on the west wall of the temple whistle, a liquid warble that might have been the cry of a nightjar except that we all knew better, and instantly a stir ran through the camp. It was checked by the low but urgent whispers of Kratas and his officers, ‘Steady, the Blues! Remember your orders. Hold your positions!’ and not a man stirred from his sleeping-mat.</p>

    <p>Without rising, and with my shawl masking my face, I turned my head slowly and looked up at the crests of the cliffs that stood higher than the temple walls. The shark’s-tooth silhouette of the granite hills began to alter most subtly. I had to blink my eyes to be certain of what I was seeing. Then slowly I turned my head in a full circle, and it was the same in whichever direction I looked. The skyline all about us was picketed with the dark and menacing shapes of armed men. They formed an unbroken palisade around us through which no fugitive could hope to escape.</p>

    <p>I knew then why Shufti had delayed his retaliation so long. It would have taken him all this time to gather together such an army of thieves. There must be a thousand or more of them, although in the poor light it was not possible to count their multitudes. We were outnumbered at least ten to one, and I felt my spirits quail. It was poor odds, even for a company of the Blues.</p>

    <p>The Shrikes stood as still as the rocks around them, and I was alarmed at this evidence of their discipline. I had expected them to come streaming down upon us in an untidy rabble, but they were behaving like trained warriors. Their stillness was more menacing and intimidating than any wild shouting and brandishing of weapons would have been.</p>

    <p>As the light strengthened swiftly, we could make them out more clearly. The first rays of the sun glanced off the bronze of their shields and their bared sword-blades, and struck darts of light into our eyes. Every one of them was muffled up, a scarf of black wool wound around each head so that only their eyes showed in the slits, eyes as malevolent as those of the ferocious blue sharks that terrorize the waters of the sea we had left behind us.</p>

    <p>The silence drew out until I thought that my nerves might tear and my heart burst with the pressure of blood within it. Then suddenly a voice rang out, shattering the dawn silence and echoing along the cliffs. ‘Kaarik! Are you awake?’</p>

    <p>I recognized Shufti then, despite the scarf that masked him. He stood in the centre of the west wall of the cliff, where the road cut through it. ‘Kaarik!’ he called again. ‘It is time for you to pay what you owe me, but the price has risen. I want everything now. Everything!’ he repeated, and flung aside the scarf so that his pock-marked features were revealed. ‘I want everything you have, including your stupid and arrogant head.’</p>

    <p>Tanus rose from his mat and threw aside his sheepskin rug. “Then you will have to come down and take % from me,’ he shouted back, and drew his sword.</p>

    <p>Shufti raised his right arm, and his blind eye caught the light and gleamed like a silver coin. Then he brought his arm down abruptly.</p>

    <p>At his signal, a shout went up from the ranks of men that lined the high ground, and they lifted their weapons and shook them to the pale yellow dawn sky. Shufti waved them forward and they streamed down the cliffs in a torrent into the narrow valley of Gallala.</p>

    <p>Tanus raced to the centre of the temple court where the ancient inhabitants had raised a tall stone altar to their patron Bes, the dwarf god of music and drunkenness. Kratas and his officers ran to join him, while the slave girls and I crouched on our mats and covered our heads, wailing with terror. ‘</p>

    <p>Tanus leaped up on to the altar, and went down on one knee as he flexed the great bow Lanata. It took all of his strength to string it, but when he stood erect again it shimmered in its coils of silver electrum wire, as though it were a living thing. He reached over his shoulder and drew an arrow from the quiver on his back and faced the main gateway through which the horde of Shrikes must enter.</p>

    <p>Below the altar, Kratas had drawn up his men into a single rank, and they also had strung their bows and faced the entrance to the square. They made a pitifully small cluster around the altar, and I felt a lump rise in my throat as I watched them. They were so heroic and undaunted. I would compose a sonnet in their honour, I decided on a sudden impulse, but before I could find the first line, the head of the mob of bandits burst howling through the ruined gateway.</p>

    <p>Only five men abreast could climb the steep stairway into the opening, and the distance to where Tanus stood on the altar was less than forty paces. Tanus drew and let his first arrow fly. That single arrow killed three men. The first of them was a tall rogue dressed in a short kilt, with long greasy tresses of hair streaming down his back. The arrow took him in the centre of his naked chest and passed through his torso as cleanly as though he were merely a target cut from a sheet of papyrus.</p>

    <p>Slick with the blood of the first man, the arrow struck the man behind him in the throat. Although the force of it was dissipating now, it still went through his neck and came out behind him, but it could not drive completely through. The fletchings at the back of the shaft snagged in his flesh, while the barbed bronze arrow-head buried itself in the eye of the third man who had crowded up close behind him. The two Shrikes were pinned together by the arrow, and they staggered and thrashed about in the middle of the gateway, blocking the opening to those who were trying to push then-way past them into the courtyard. At last the arrow-head tore out of the third man’s skull, with the eye impaled .upon the point. The two stricken men fell apart, and a throng of screaming bandits poured over them into the square. The small band around the altar met them with volley after volley of arrows, shooting them down so that then- corpses almost blocked the opening, and those coming in from behind were forced to scramble over the mounds of dead and wounded.</p>

    <p>It could not last much longer, the pressure of warriors from behind was too great and their numbers too overwhelming. Like the bursting of an earthen dyke unable to stem the rising flood of the Nile, they forced the opening, and a solid mass of fighting men poured into the square and surrounded the tiny band around the altar of the god Bes.</p>

    <p>It was too close quarters for the bows now, and Tanus and his men cast them aside and drew their swords. ‘Horus, arm me!’ Tanus shouted his battle-cry, and the men around him took it up, as they went to work. Bronze rang on bronze as the Shrikes tried to come at them, but they had formed a ring around the altar, facing outwards. No matter from which side they came, the Shrikes were met by the point and the deadly sword-play of the guards. The Shrikes were not short of courage, and they pressed in serried ranks around the altar. As one of them was cut down, another leaped into his place.</p>

    <p>I saw Shufti in the gateway. He was holding back from the fray, but cursing his men and; ordering them into the thick of it with horrid howls of rage. His blind eye rolled in its socket as he exhorted them, ‘Get me the Assyrian alive. I want to kill him slowly and hear him squeal.</p>

    <p>The bandits completely ignored the women who cowered on their sleeping-mats, their heads covered, waiting and screeching with terror. I wailed with the best of them, but the struggle in the centre of the yard was too uncomfortable for my liking. By this time, there were over a thousand men crowded into the confined space. Choking in the dust, I was kicked and pummelled by the sandalled feet of the battling horde, until I managed to crawl away into a corner of the wall.</p>

    <p>One of the bandits turned aside from the fighting and stooped over me. He tore the shawl away from my face and for a moment stared into my eyes. ‘Mother of Isis,’ he breathed, ‘you are beautiful!’</p>

    <p>He was an ugly devil with gaps in his teeth and a scar down one cheek. His breath stank like a sewerage gutter as he lusted into my face. ‘Wait until this business is over. Then I’ll give you something to make you squeal with joy,’ he promised, and twisted my face up to his. He kissed me.</p>

    <p>My natural instinct was to pull away from him, but I resisted it and returned his kiss. I am an artist of the love arts, for I learned my skills in the boys’ quarters of Lord Intef. My kisses can turn a man to water.</p>

    <p>I kissed him with all my skill, and he was transfixed by it. While he was still paralysed, I slipped my dagger from its sheath beneath my blouse and slid the point through the gap between his fifth and sixth ribs. When he screamed, I muffled the sound with my own lips and clasped him lovingly to my breast, twisting the blade in his heart until, with a shudder, he relaxed completely against me, and I let him roll over on his side.</p>

    <p>I looked around me quickly. In the few moments that it had taken me to dispose of my admirer, the plight of the small group of guards around the altar had worsened. There were gaps in their single rank. Two men were down and Amseth was wounded. He had switched his sword into his left hand, while the other arm hung bleeding at his side.</p>

    <p>With a rush of relief I saw that Tanus was still untouched, still laughing with the savage joy of it all as he plied the sword.’But he had left it too late to spring the trap, I thought. The eitee band of Shrikes were crowded into the square and bafying around him like hounds around a treed leopard. Withiri’ moments he and his gallant little band must be cut down.</p>

    <p>Even as I watched, Tanus killed another of them with a straight thrust through the throat, and then he jerked his blade free of the clinging flesh and stepped back. He threw back his head and let loose a bellow that rang from the crumbling walls around us. ‘On me, the Blues!’</p>

    <p>On the instant every one of the cringing slave girls leapt up and flung aside their trailing robes. Their swords were already bared and they fell upon the rear of the robber horde. The surprise was complete and overwhelming. I saw them kill a hundred or more before their victims even realized what they were about, and could rally to meet them. But when they did turn to face this fresh attack, they exposed their backs to Tanus and his little band.</p>

    <p>They fought well, I’ll give them that, though I am sure it was terror, rather than courage, that drove them on. However, their ranks were too close-packed to allow them free play with the sword, and the men they faced were some of the finest troops in Egypt, which is to say the entire world.</p>

    <p>For a while yet they held on. Then Tanus bellowed again from the midst of the turmoil. For a moment I thought it was another command, then I realized that it was the opening bar of the battle hymn of the guards. Though I had often heard it spoken in awe that the Blues always sang when the battle was at its height, I had never truly believed it possible. Now all around me the song was taken up by a hundred straining voices:</p>

    <p>We are the Breath of Horus, hot as the desert wind, we are the reapers of men?</p>

    <p>Their swords beat an accompaniment to the words, like the clangour of hammers on the anvils of the underworld. In the face of such arrogant ferocity the remaining Shrikes wavered, and then suddenly it was no longer a battle, but a massacre.</p>

    <p>I have seen a pack of wild dogs surround and tear into a flock of sheep. This was worse. Some of the Shrikes threw down their swords and fell to their knees begging quarter. There was no mercy shown them. Others tried to reach the gateway, but guardsmen waited for them there, sword in hand.</p>

    <p>I danced on the fringes of the fighting, screaming across at Tanus, trying to make myself heard in the uproar, ‘Stop them. We need prisoners.’</p>

    <p>Tanus could not hear me, or more likely he simply ignored my entreaties. Singing and laughing, with Kratas at his left hand and Remrem on the other, he tore into them. His beard was soaked with the spurted blood of those he had killed, and his eyes glittered in the running red mask of his face with a madness I had never seen in them before. Joyous Hapi, how he thrived on the heady draught of battle!</p>

    <p>‘Stop it, Tanus! Don’t kill them all!’ This time he heard me. I saw the madness fade, and he was once more in control of himself.</p>

    <p>‘Give quarter to those who plead for it!’ he roared, and the guards obeyed him. But in the end, out of the original thousand, fewer than two hundred Shrikes grovelled unarmed on the bloody stone flags and pleaded for their lives.</p>

    <p>For a while I stood dazed and uncertain on the fringe of this carnage, and then from the corner of my eye I caught a furtive movement.</p>

    <p>Shufti had realized that he could not escape through the gateway. He threw down his sword and darted to the east wall of the court, close to where I stood. This was the most ruined section, where the wall was reduced to half its original height. The tumbled mud-bricks formed a steep ramp, and Shufti scrambled up it, slipping and falling, but rapidly nearing the top of the wall. It seemed that I was the only one who had noticed his flight. The guards were busy with their other prisoners, and Tanus had his back turned to me as he directed the mopping-up of the shattered enemy.</p>

    <p>Almost without thinking, I stooped and picked up half ai mud-brick. As Shufti topped the wall, I hurled the brick up at him with all my strength. It thumped against the back off his skull with such force that he dropped to his knees, and! then the treacherous pile of loose rubble gave way beneath) him and he came sliding back down in a cloud of dust to) land at my feet, only half-conscious.</p>

    <p>I pSunced upon him where he lay, straddling his chest,, and I firessed the point of my dagger to his throat. He stared! up at me, his single eye still glazed with the crack I hadl dealt him.</p>

    <p>‘Lie still,’ I cautioned him, ‘or I will gut you like a fish.”</p>

    <p>I had lost my shawl and head-dress, and my hair hadl come down on to my shoulders. He recognized me then,, which was no surprise. We had met often, but in differentt circumstances.</p>

    <p>‘Taita, the eunuch!’ he mumbled. ‘Does Lord Intef know what you are about?’</p>

    <p>‘He will find out soon enough,’ I assured him, andi pricked him until he grunted, ‘but you will not be the one to enlighten him.’</p>

    <p>Without removing the point from his throat, I shouted to two of the nearest guards to take him. They flipped him on to his face and bound his wrists together with linen twine before they dragged him away.</p>

    <p>Tanus had seen me capture Shufti, and he strode across to me now, stepping over the dead and wounded. ‘Good throw, Taita! You have forgotten nothing that I taught you.’ He clapped me on the back so hard that I staggered. ‘There is plenty of work for you still. We’ve lost four men killed, and there are at least a dozen wounded.’</p>

    <p>‘What about their camp?’ I asked, and he stared at me.</p>

    <p>‘Whatcamp?’</p>

    <p>‘A thousand Shrikes did not spring up from the sands like desert flowers. They must have pack-animals and slaves with them. Not far from here, either. You must not let them escape. Nobody must escape to tell the tale of today’s battle.</p>

    <p>None of them must be allowed to carry the news to Karnak that you are still alive.’</p>

    <p>‘Sweet Isis, you are right! But how will we find them?’ It was obvious that Tanus was still bemused with battle lust. Sometimes I wondered what he would do without me.</p>

    <p>‘Back-track them,’ I told him impatiently. ‘A thousand pairs of feet will have trodden a road for us to follow back to where they came from.’</p>

    <p>His expression cleared, and he hailed Kratas across the length of the temple. ‘Take fifty men. Go with Taita. He will lead you to their base-camp.’</p>

    <p>‘The wounded?’ I began to protest. I had enjoyed enough fighting for one day, but he brushed my objections aside. ‘You are the best tracker I have. The wounded can wait for your care, my ruffians are all as tough as fresh buffalo steaks, very few of them will die before you return.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">FINDING THEIR CAMP WAS AS SIMPLE AS I had made it sound. With Kratas and fifty men following me closely, made a wide cast around the city, and behind the first line of hills I picked up the broad track that they had made as they came in and deployed to surround us. We followed it back at a trot, and had covered less than a mile before we topped a rise and found the camp of the Shrikes in the shallow valley below us.</p>

    <p>Their surprise was complete. They had left fewer than twenty men to guard the donkeys and women. Kratas’ men overran them at the first rush, and this time I was too late to save any prisoners. They spared only the women, and once the camp was secure, Kratas let his men have them as part of the traditional reward of the victors.</p>

    <p>The women seemed to me to be a more comely selection than I would have expected in such company. I saw quite a few pretty faces amongst them. They submitted to the rituals of conquest with a remarkably good grace. I even heard some of them laughing and joking as the guardsmen threw dice for them. The vocation of camp-follower to a band of Shrikes could not be considered the most delicate calling, and I doubted that any of these ladies were blushing virgins. One by one, they were led by their new owners behind the cover of the nearest clump of rocks, where their skirts were lifted without further ceremony.</p>

    <p>New moon follows the death of the old, spring follows winter, none of the ladies showed any signs of mourning for their erstwhile spouses. Indeed, it seemed probable that new and perhaps lasting relationships were being struck up here on the desert sand.</p>

    <p>For myself, I was more interested in the pack-donkeys and what they carried. There were over a hundred and fifty of theses ;and most of them were sturdy animals in prime condition which would fetch good prices in the market at Karnak or Safaga. I reckoned that I should be entitled to at least a centurion’s share when the prize money was divided up. After all, I had already dispensed large amounts of my own savings in the furtherance of this enterprise, and should be entitled to some compensation. I would speak seriously to Tanus about it, and could expect his sympathy. His is a generous spirit.</p>

    <p>By the time we returned to the city of Gallala, leading the captured pack-animals laden with booty and followed by a straggle of women who had attached themselves quite naturally to their new menfolk, the sun had set.</p>

    <p>One of the smaller ruined buildings near the wells had been turned into a field hospital. There I worked through the night, by the light of torch and oil lamp, sewing together the wounded guardsmen. As always, I was impressed by their stoicism, for many of their wounds were grave and painful. None the less, I lost only one of my patients before dawn broke. Amseth succumbed to loss of blood from the severed arteries in his arm. If I had attended to him immediately after the battle, instead of going off into the desert, I might have been able to save him. Even though the responsibility rested with Tanus, I felt the familiar guilt and sorrow in the face of a death that I might have prevented. However, I was confident that my other patients would heal swiftly and cleanly. They were all strong young men in superb condition.</p>

    <p>There were no wounded Shrikes to attend. Their heads had been lopped off where they lay on the battlefield. As a physician, I was perturbed by this age-old custom of dealing with the wounded enemy, yet I suppose there was logic in it. Why should the victors waste their resources on the maimed vanquished, when it was unlikely they would have any value as slaves, and, if left alive, might recover to fight against them another day?</p>

    <p>I worked all night with only a swallow of wine and a few mouthfuls of food taken with bloody hands to sustain me, and I was almost exhausted, but there was to be no rest for me yet. Tanus sent for me as soon as it was light</p>

    <p class="Chap">THE UNWOUNDED PRISONERS WERE BEING held in the temple of Bes. Their wrists were bound behind their backs, and they were squatting in long lines along the north wall, with the guards standing over them.</p>

    <p>As soon as I entered the temple, Tanus called me to where he stood with a group of his officers. I was still in the dress of an Assyrian wife, so I lifted my blood-splattered skirts and picked my way across the floor littered with the debris of the battle.</p>

    <p>‘There are thirteen clans of Shrikes?isn’t that what you told me, Taita?’ Tanus asked, and I nodded. ‘Each clan with its own baron. We have Shufti. Let’s see if you recognize any of the other barons amongst this gathering of the fair and gentle people.’ He indicated the prisoners with a chuckle, and took my arm to lead me down the ranks of squatting men.</p>

    <p>I kept my face veiled so that none of the prisoners could recognize me. I glanced at each face as I passed, and recognized two of them. Akheku was head of the southern clan that preyed on the lands around Assoun, Elephantine and the first cataract, while Setek was from further north, the baron of Kom-Ombo.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Shufti had gathered together whatever men he could find at such short notice. There were members of all the clans amongst those that we had captured. As I identified their leaders with a tap on the shoulder, they were dragged away.</p>

    <p>When we reached the end of the line Tanus asked, ‘Are you sure that you missed none of them?’</p>

    <p>‘How can I be sure? I told you that I never met all of the barons.’</p>

    <p>Tanus shrugged. ‘We could not hope to catch every little bird with one throw of the net. We must count ourselves fortunate that we have taken as many as three so soon. But let us look at the heads. We might be lucky enough to find a few more amongst them.’</p>

    <p>This was a gruesome business that might have affected a more delicate stomach than mine, but human flesh, both dead and living, is my stock-in-trade. While we sat at our ease on the steps of the temple enjoying our breakfast, the severed heads were displayed to us, held up one at a time by the blood-caked hair, tongues lolling from between slack lips, and dull eyes powdered with dust staring into the other world whither they were bound.</p>

    <p>My appetite was as healthy as ever, for I had eaten very little during the last two days. I devoured the delicious cakes and fruits that Tiamat had provided, while I pointed out those heads I recognized. There was a score or so of common thieves that I had encountered during the course of my work for Lord Intef, but only one more of the barons. He was Nefer-Temu of Qena, a lesser member of the ghastly brotherhood.</p>

    <p>“That makes four of them,’ Tanus grunted with satisfaction, and ordered Nefer-Temu’s head to be placed on the pinnacle of the pyramid of skulls that he was erecting in front of the well of Gallala.</p>

    <p>‘So now we have accounted for four of them. We must find the other nine barons. Let us begin by putting the question to our prisoners.’ He stood up briskly, and I hastily gulped down the remains of my breakfast and followed him reluctantly back into the temple of Bes.</p>

    <p>Although I was the one who had made clear to Tanus the necessity of having informers from within the clans, and indeed it was I who had suggested how we should recruit them, still now that the time to act upon my suggestion had arrived, I was stricken with remorse and guilt. It was one thing to suggest ruthless action, but another thing entirely to stand by and watch it practised.</p>

    <p>I made a feeble excuse that the wounded men in the makeshift hospital might need me, but Tanus brushed it away cheerfully. ‘None of your fine scruples now, Taita. You will stay with me during the questioning to make certain that you overlooked none of your old friends on your first inspection.’</p>

    <p>The questioning was swift and merciless, which I suppose was only appropriate to the character of the men we were dealing with.</p>

    <p>To begin with, Tanus sprang up on to the storie altar of Bes, and, with the hawk seal in one hand, he looked down on the ranks of squatting prisoners with a smile %at must have chilled them, even though they sat in the full rays of the desert sun.</p>

    <p>‘I am the bearer of the hawk seal of Pharaoh Mamose, and I speak with his voice,’ he told them grimly, as he held the statuette high. ‘I am your judge and your executioner.’ He paused and let his gaze pass slowly over their upturned faces. As each of them met his eyes, they dropped their own. Not one of them could hold firm before his penetrating scrutiny.</p>

    <p>‘You have been taken in the act of pillage and murder. If there is one of you who would deny it, let him stand before me and declare his innocence.’</p>

    <p>He waited while the impatient shadows of the vultures, circling in the sky above us, criss-crossed the dusty courtyard. ‘Come now! Speak up, you innocents.’ He glanced upwards at the circling birds with their grotesque pink bald heads. ‘Your brethren grow impatient for the feast. Let us not keep them waiting.’</p>

    <p>Still none of them spoke or moved, and Tanus lowered the hawk seal. ‘Your actions, which all here have witnessed, condemn you. Your silence confirms the verdict. You are guilty. In the name of the divine Pharaoh, I pass sentence upon you. I sentence you to death by beheading. Your severed heads will be displayed along the caravan routes. All law-abiding men who pass this way will see your skulls grinning at them from the roadside, and they will know that the Shrjke has met the eagle. They will know that the age of lawlessness has passed from the land, and that peace has returned to this very Egypt of ours. I have spoken. Pharaoh Mamose has spoken.’</p>

    <p>Tanus nodded, and the first prisoner was dragged forward and forced to his knees before the altar.</p>

    <p>‘If you answer three questions truthfully, your life will be spared. You will be enlisted as a trooper in my regiment of the guards, with all the pay and privileges. If you refuse to answer the questions, your sentence will be carried out immediately,’ Tanus told him.</p>

    <p>He looked down on the kneeling prisoner sternly. ‘This is the first question. What clan do you belong to?’</p>

    <p>The condemned man made no reply. The blood oath of the Shrikes was too strong for him to break.</p>

    <p>‘This is the second question. Who is the baron that commands you?’ Tanus asked, and still the man was silent.</p>

    <p>‘This is the third and the last question. Will you lead me to the secret places where your clan hides?’ Tanus asked, and the man looked up at him, hawked in his throat and spat. His phlegm spattered yellow upon the stones. Tanus nodded to the guardsman who stood over him with the sword.</p>

    <p>The stroke was clean and the head toppled on to the steps at the foot of the altar. ‘One more head for the pyramid,’ Tanus said quietly, and nodded for the next prisoner to be brought forward.</p>

    <p>He asked the same three questions, and when the Shrike answered him with a defiant obscenity, Tanus nodded. This time the headsman mistimed the blow and the corpse flopped about with the neck only half-severed. It took three more strokes before the head bounced down the steps.</p>

    <p>Tanus lopped twenty-three heads, I was counting them to distract myself from the waves of debilitating compassion that assailed me, until the first of the condemned men broke down. He was young, not much more than a boy. In a shrill voice he gabbled out the replies before Tanus could actually pose the three questions to him.</p>

    <p>‘My name is Hui. I am a blood-brother of the clan of Basti the Cruel. I know his secret places, and I will lead you to them.’ Tanus smiled with grim satisfaction and gestured for the lad to be led away. ‘Care for him well,’ he warned his gaolers. ‘He is now a trooper of the Blues, and your companion-in-arms.’</p>

    <p>After the defection of one of them, it went more readily, although there were still many who defied Tanus. Some of them cursed him, while others laughed their defiance at him until the blade swept down, and their bravado ended with their very last breath that burst from the severed windpipe in a crimson gust.</p>

  <a id="section_5"></a>

  

  <div>
    <p>I was filled with admiration for those who, after a base and despicable life, at the end chose to die with some semblance of honour. They laughed at death. I knew #iat I was not capable of that quality of courage. Offered that choice, I am certain that I would have responded as some of the weaker prisoners did.</p>

    <p>‘I am a member of the clan of Ur,’ one confessed.</p>

    <p>‘I am of the clan of Maa-En-Tef, who is baron of the west bank as far as El Kharga,’ said another, until we had informers to lead us to the strongholds of every one of the remaining robber barons, and a shoulder-high pile of recalcitrant heads to add to the pyramid beside the well.</p>

    <p class="Chap">ONE OF THE MATTERS TO WHICH TANUS and I had given much thought was the disposal of the three robber barons we had already captured, and the score of informers we had gleaned from the ranks of the condemned Shrikes. ___ We knew that the influence of the Shrikes was so pervasive that we dared not keep our captives in Egypt. There was not a prison secure enough to prevent Akh-Seth and his barons from reaching them, either to set them free by bribery or force, or to have them silenced by poison or some other unpleasant means. We knew that Akh-Seth was like an octopus whose head was hidden, but whose tentacles reached into every facet of our government and into the very fabric of our existence.</p>

    <p>This was where my friend Tiamat, the merchant of Saf-aga, came into my reckoning.</p>

    <p>Matching now as a unit of the Blue Crocodile Guards, and not as a slave caravan, we returned to the port on the Red Sea in half the time that it had taken us to reach Gallala. Our captives were hustled aboard one of Tiamat’s trading vessels that was waiting for us in the harbour, and the captain set sail immediately for the Arabian coast, where Tiamat maintained a secure slave-compound on the small off-shore island of Jez Baquan, run by his own warders. The waters around the island were patrolled by packs of ferocious blue sharks. Tiamat assured us that no one who had attempted escape from the island had ever avoided both the vigilance of the warders and the appetites of the sharks.</p>

    <p>Only one of our captives was not sent to the island. He was Hui from the clan of Basti the Cruel, the same youngster who had been the first to capitulate to the threat of execution. During the march to the sea, Tanus had kept the lad close to him and had turned all the irresistible force of his personality upon him. By this time Hui was his willing slave. This special gift of Tanus’ to win loyalty and devotion from the most unlikely quarters never failed to amaze me. I was sure that Hui, who had buckled so swiftly under the threat of execution, would now willingly lay down his worthless life for Tanus.</p>

    <p>Under Tanus’ spell, Hui poured out every detail that he could remember of the clan to which he had once sworn a blood-oath. I listened quietly, with my writing-brush poised, as Tanus questioned him and I recorded all he had to tell us.</p>

    <p>We learned that the stronghold of Basti the Cruel was in the fastness of that awful desert of Gebel-Umm-Bahari, on the summit of one of the flat-topped mountains that was protected by sheer cliffs on every side. Hidden and impregnable, but less than two days’ march from the east bank of the Nile and the busy caravan routes that ran along its banks, it was the perfect nest for the raptor.</p>

    <p>“There is one path to the top, cut like a stairway from the rock. It is wide enough for only one man to climb at a time,’ Hui told us.</p>

    <p>“There is no other way to the summit?’ Tanus asked, and Hui grinned and laid his finger along his nose in a conspir-atory gesture.</p>

    <p>‘There is another route. I have used it often, to return to the mountain after I had deserted my post to visit a lady Mend. Basti would have had me killed if he had known I was missing. It is a dangerous climb, but a dozen godd men could make it and hold the top of the cliff while the main force came up the pathway to them. I will lead you up it, Akh-Horus.’</p>

    <p>It was the first time that I heard the name. Akh-Horus, the brother of the great god Horus. It was a good name for Tanus. Naturally, Hui and our other captives could not know Tanus’ real identity. They knew only in their simple way that Tanus must be some kind of god. He looked like a god and he fought like a god, and he invoked the nametrf Horus in the midst of battle. So, they had reasoned, he must be the brother of Horus.</p>

    <p>Akh-Horus! It was a name that all Egypt would come to know well in the months ahead. It would be shouted from hilltop to hilltop. It would be carried along the caravan routes. It would travel the length of the river on the lips of the boatmen, from city to city, and from kingdom to kingdom. The legend would grow up around the name, as the accounts of his deeds were repeated and exaggerated at each telling.</p>

    <p>Akh-Horus was the mighty warrior who appeared from nowhere, sent by his brother Horus to continue the eternal struggle against evil, against Akh-Seth, the lord of the Shrikes.</p>

    <p>Akh-Horus! Each time the people of Egypt repeated the name, it would fill their hearts with fresh hope.</p>

    <p>All that was in the future as we sat in the garden of Tia-mat the merchant. Only I knew how hot Tanus was for Basti, and how eager to lead his men into the Gebel-Umm-Bahari to hunt him down. It was not only that Basti was the most rapacious and pitiless of all the barons. There was much more to it than that. Tanus had a very personal score to settle with that bandit.</p>

    <p>From me, Tanus had learned that Basti had been the particular instrument that Akh-Seth had used to destroy the fortune of Pianki, Lord Harrab, Tanus’ father.</p>

    <p>‘I can lead you up the cliffs of Gebel-Umm-Bahari,’ Hui promised. ‘I can deliver Basti into your hands.’</p>

    <p>Tanus, was silent awhile in the darkness as he savoured that promise. We sat and listened to the nightingale singing at the bottom of Tiamat’s garden. It was a sound totally alien from the evil and desperate affairs that we were discussing. After a while Tanus sighed and dismissed Hui.</p>

    <p>‘You have done well, lad,’ he told him. ‘Fulfil your promise, and you will find me grateful.’</p>

    <p>Hui prostrated himself, as though before a god, and Tanus nudged him irritably with his foot. ‘Enough of that nonsense. Away with you now.’</p>

    <p>This recent, unlooked-for elevation to the godhead embarrassed Tanus. No one could ever accuse him of being either modest or humble, but he was at least a pragmatist, with noi false illusions of his own station; he never aspired to become either a pharaoh or a divine, and he was always short with any servility or obsequious behaviour from those around him.</p>

    <p>As soon as the lad was gone, Tanus turned back to me. ‘So often I lie awake in the night and consider all that you have told me about my father. I ache in every fibre of my body and soul for revenge against the one who drove him into penury and disgrace and hounded him to his death. I can barely restrain myself. I am filled by the desire to abandon this devious way that you have devised of trapping Akh-Seth. Instead, I long to seek him out directly, and tear out his foul heart with my bare hands.’</p>

    <p>‘If you do that, you will lose everything,’ I said. ‘You know that well. Do it my way and you will restore not only your own reputation, but that of your noble father into the bargain. My way, you will retrieve the estate and the fortune that was stolen from you. My way will not only give you your full measure of revenge, but will also lead you back to Lostris and the fulfilment of the vision that I divined for the pah- of you in the Mazes of Ammon-Ra. Trust me, Tanus. For your sake and the sake of my mistress, trust me.’</p>

    <p>‘If I don’t trust you, then who can I trust?’ he asked, and touched my arm. ‘I know you are right, but I have always lacked patience. For me the swift and direct road has always been easiest.’</p>

    <p>‘For the time being, put Akh-Seth out of your mind. Think only of the next step along the devious way that we must travel together. Think of Basti the Cruel. It was Basti who destroyed your father’s trade caravans as they returned from the East. For five seasons, not one of the caravans of Lord Harrab ever returned to Karnak. They were all attacked and looted along the road. It was Basti who destroyed your father’s copper-mines at Sestra and murdered the engineers, and their slave workers. Since then those rich veins of ore have lain untapped. It was Basti who systematically pillaged your father’s estates along the Nile, who slaughtered his slaves in the fields and burned the crops, until in the end, only weeds grew in Lord Harrab’s fields, and he was forced to sell them at a fraction of their real worth.’</p>

    <p>‘All that may be true, but it was Akh-Seth who gave Basti his orders.’</p>

    <p>‘No one will believe that. Pharaoh will not believe that, unless he hears Basti confess it,’ I told him impatiently. ‘Why are you always so stubborn? We have gone over this a hundred times. The barons first, and then at last the head of the snake, Akh-Seth.’</p>

    <p>‘Yours is the voice of wisdom, I know it. But it is hard to bear the waiting. I long for my revenge. I long to cleanse the stain of sedition and treason from my honour, and I long?oh, how I long for Lostris!’</p>

    <p>He leaned across and clasped my shoulder with a grip that made me wince. ‘You have done enough here, old friend. I could never have accomplished so much without you. If you had not come to find me, I might still be sodden with drink and lying in the embrace of some stinking whore. I owe you more than I can ever repay, but I must send you away now. You are needed elsewhere. Basti is my meat, and I don’t need you to share the feast with me. You will not be coming with me to Gebel-Umm-Bahari. I am sending you back where you belong?where I also belong, but where I cannot be?at the side of the Lady Lostris. I envy you, old friend, I would give up my hope of immortality to be going to her in your place.’</p>

    <p>I protested most prettily, of course. I swore that all I wanted was another chance at those villains, and that I was his companion and that I would be seriously aggrieved if he would not give me a place at his side in the next campaign. All the time I was secure in the knowledge that when Tanus set his mind on a course of action he was adamant and could not easily be dissuaded, except very occasionally by his friend and adviser, Taita the slave.</p>

    <p>The truth was that I had enjoyed my fill of wild heroics and people trying to kill me. I was not by nature a soldier, not some insensitive clod of a trooper. I hated the rigours of campaigning in the desert. I could not bear another week of heat and sweat and flies without even a glimpse of the sweet green waters of Mother Nile. I longed for the feel of clean linen against my freshly bathed and anointed skin. I missed my mistress more than I could express in mere words. Our quiet, civilized life in the painted rooms on the Island Of Elephantine, our music and long, leisurely conversations together, my pets and my scrolls, all these exerted an irresistible draw upon me.</p>

    <p>Tanus was right, he no longer needed me, and my place was with my mistress. However, to acquiesce too readily to his orders might lower his opinion of me, and I did not want that either.</p>

    <p>At last I allowed him to convince me, and, concealing my eagerness, I began my preparations for my return to Elephantine.</p>

    <p class="Chap">TANUS HAD ORDERED KRATAS BACK TO Karnak, to assemble and bring up reinforcements for the expedition into the desert of Gebel-Umm-Bahari. I was to travel under his protection as far as Karnak, but taking leave of Tanus was not a simple matter. Twice when I had already left the house of Tiamat to join Kratas where he waited for me on the outskirts of the town, Tanus called me back to give me another message to take to my mistress.</p>

    <p>‘Tell her that I think of her every hour of every day!’ ‘You have already given me that message,’ I protested. ‘Tell her that my dreams are filled with images of her lovely face.’</p>

    <p>‘And that one also. I can recite them by heart. Give me something new,’ I pleaded.</p>

    <p>‘Tell her that I believe the vision of the Mazes, that in a few short years we will be together?’</p>

    <p>‘Kratas is waiting for me. If you keep me here, how can I deliver your message?’</p>

    <p>‘Tell her that everything I do is for her. Every breath I draw is for her?’ he broke off, and embraced me. ‘The truth is, Taita, I doubt I can live another day without her.’</p>

    <p>‘Five years will pass like that single day. When next you meet her, your honour will be restored and you will once more stand high in the land. She can only love you the more for that.’</p>

    <p>He released me. ‘Take good care of her until I am able to assume that joyous duty from you. Now, away vyjth you. Speed to her side.’</p>

    <p>“That has been my intention this hour past,’ I told him wryly, and made good my escape.</p>

    <p>With Kratas at the head of our small detachment, we made the journey to Karnak in under a week. Fearful of discovery by Rasfer or Lord Intef, I spent as little time in my beloved city as it took me to find passage on one of the barges heading southwards. I left Kratas busily recruiting from amongst the elite regiments of Pharaoh’s guards the thousand good men that Tanus had demanded, and I went aboard the barge.</p>

    <p>We had the north wind in our sails all the way, and we tied up at the wharf of East Elephantine twelve days after leaving Thebes. I was still dressed in the wig and garb of the priesthood, and nobody recognized me as I came ashore.</p>

    <p>For the price of a small copper ring I hired a felucca to take me across the river to the royal island, and it put me down at the steps that led up to the water-gate to our garden in the harem. My heart pounded against my ribs as I bounded up the stairs. I had been away from my mistress far too long. It was at times such as these that I realized the full strength of my feelings for her. I was certain that Tanus’ love was but a light river breeze in comparison to the khamsin of my own emotions.</p>

    <p>One of Lostris’ Cushite maidens met me at the gate, and tried to prevent me from entering. ‘My mistress is unwell, priest. There is another doctor with her at this moment. She will not see you.’</p>

    <p>‘She will see me,’ I told her, and stripped off my wig.</p>

    <p>‘Taita!? she squealed, and fell to her knees, frantically making the sign to ward off evil. ‘You are dead. This is not you, but some evil apparition from beyond the grave.’</p>

    <p>I brushed her aside and hurried to my mistress’s private quarters, to be met at the doors by one of those priests of Osiris who consider themselves physicians.</p>

    <p>‘What are you doing here?’ I demanded of him, appalled that one of these quacks had been anywhere near my mistress. Before he could answer, I bellowed at him, ‘Out! Get out of here! Take your spells and charms and filthy potions, and don’t come back.’</p>

    <p>He looked as though he were prepared to argue, but I placed my hand between his shoulder-blades and gave him a running start towards the gate. Then I rushed to my mistress’s bedside.</p>

    <p>The odour of sickness filled the chamber, sour and strong, and a wild grief seized me as I looked down at the Lady Lostris. She seemed to have shrunk in size, and her skin was pale as the ashes of an old camp-fire. She was asleep or in a coma, I could not be certain which, but there were dark, bruised shadows beneath her closed eyelids. Her lips had that dry and crusty look that filled me with dread.</p>

    <p>I drew back the linen sheet that covered her and beneath it she was naked. I stared in horror at her body. The flesh had melted off her. Her limbs were thin as sticks and her ribs and the bones of her pelvis stuck out through the unhealthy skin, like those of drought-stricken kine. Tenderly, I placed my hand in her armpit to feel for the heat of fever, but her skin was cool. What kind of disease was this, I fretted. I had not encountered any like it before.</p>

    <p>Without leaving her side, I yelled for her slave girls, but none of them had the courage to face the ghost of Taita. In the end I had to storm into their quarters and drag one of them whimpering from under her bed.</p>

    <p>‘What have you done to your mistress to bring her to this pass?’ I kicked her fat backside to focus her attention on my question, and she whined and covered her face, so as not to have to look upon me.</p>

    <p>‘She will not eat. Barely a mouthful in all these weeks. Not since the mummy of Tanus, Lord Harrab was laid in his tomb in the Valley of the Nobles. She has even lost the child of Pharaoh that she was carrying in her womb. Spare me, kind ghost, I have done you no harm.’</p>

    <p>I stared down at her in bewilderment for a moment, until I realized what had happened. My message of comfort to the Lady Lostris had never been delivered. Intuitively I guessed that the messenger whom Kratas had dispatched from Luxor to carry my letter to my mistress, had never reached Elephantine. He had probably become one more victim of the Shrikes, just another corpse floating down the river with an empty purse and a gaping wound in his throat. I hoped that my letter had fallen into the hands of some illiterate thief, and not been taken to Akh-Seth. There was no time to worry about that now.</p>

    <p>I rushed back to my mistress’s side and fell on my knees beside her bed. ‘My darling,’ I whispered, and stroked her haggard brow. ‘It is me, Taita, your slave.’</p>

    <p>She stirred slightly and mumbled something I could not catch. I realized that there was little time to spare; she was far-gone. It was over a month since Tanus’ purported death. If the slave girl had spoken the truth, and she had indeed taken no food in all that time, then it was a wonder that she was still alive.</p>

    <p>I leaped up again and ran to my own rooms. Despite my ‘demise’ nothing had been changed, and my medicine chest was in the alcove where I had left it. With it in my arms, I hurried back to my mistress. My hands were shaking as I lit a twig of the scorpion bush from the flame of the oil lamp beside her bed, and held the glowing end under her nose. Almost immediately she gasped and sneezed and struggled to avoid the pungent smoke.</p>

    <p>‘Mistress, it is I, Taita. Speak to me.’</p>

    <p>She opened her eyes and I saw the dawn of pleasure in them swiftly extinguished by the fresh realization of her bereavement. She held out her thin, pale arms to me, and I took her to my breast.</p>

    <p>‘Taita,’ she sobbed softly. ‘He is dead. Tanus is dead. I cannot live without him.’</p>

    <p>‘No! No! He is alive. I come directly from him with messages of love and devotion from him to you.’</p>

    <p>‘You are cruel to mock me so. I know he is dead. His tomb is scaled?’</p>

    <p>‘It was .a, subterfuge to mislead his enemies,’ I cried.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus lives. I swear it to you. He loves you. He waits for you.’</p>

    <p>‘Oh, that I could believe you! But I know you so well. You will lie to protect me. How can you tormept me with false promises? I hate you so?*’ She tried to break from my arms.</p>

    <p>‘I swear it. Tanus is alive.’</p>

    <p>‘Swear on the honour of the mother you never knew. Swear on the wrath of all the gods.’ She hardly had the strength to challenge me.</p>

    <p>‘On all these I swear, and on my love and duty to you, my mistress.’</p>

    <p>‘Can it be?’ I saw the strength of hope flow back into her, and a faint flush of color bloom in her cheeks. ‘Oh, Taita, can it truly be?’</p>

    <p>‘Would I look so joyful, if it were not? You know I love him almost as much as you do. Could I smile thus, if Tanus were truly dead?’</p>

    <p>While she stared into my eyes, I launched into a recitation of all that had occurred since I had left her side so many weeks ago. I excluded only the details of the condition in which I had discovered Tanus hi the old shack in the swamps, and the female company I had found him keeping.</p>

    <p>She said not a word, but her eyes never left my face as she devoured my words. Her pale face, almost translucent with starvation, glowed like a pearl as she listened to my account of our adventures at Gallala, of how Tanus led the fighting like a god, and of how he sang with the wild joy of battle.</p>

    <p>‘And so you see, it is true. Tanus is alive,’ I ended, and she spoke for the first time since I had begun.</p>

    <p>‘If he is alive, then bring him to me. I will not eat a mouthful until I set my eyes upon his face once more.’</p>

    <p>‘I will bring him to your side as swiftly as I can send a messenger to him, if that is what you wish,’ I promised, and reached for the polished bronze mirror from my chest.</p>

    <p>I held the mirror before her eyes, and asked softly, ‘Do you want him to see you as you are now?’</p>

    <p>She stared at her own gaunt, hollow-eyed image.</p>

    <p>‘I will send for him today, if you order it. He could be here within a week, if you really want that.’</p>

    <p>I watched her straggle with her emotions. ‘I am ugly,’ she whispered. ‘I look like an old woman.’</p>

    <p>‘Your beauty is still there, just below the surface.’</p>

    <p>‘I cannot let Tanus see me like this.’ Feminine vanity had triumphed over all her other emotions.</p>

    <p>‘Then you must eat.’</p>

    <p>‘You promise,’ she wavered, ‘you promise that he is still alive, and that you will bring him to me as soon as I am well again? Place your hand on my heart and swear it to me.’</p>

    <p>I could feel her every rib and her heart fluttering like a trapped bird beneath my fingers. ‘I promise,’ I said.</p>

    <p>‘I will trust you this time, but if you are lying I will never trust you again. Bring me food!’</p>

    <p>As I hurried to the kitchen, I could not help but feel smug. Taita, the crafty, had got his own way yet again.</p>

    <p>I mixed a bowl of warm milk and honey. We would have to begin slowly, for she had driven herself to the very edge of starvation. She vomited up the contents of the first bowl, but was able to keep down the second. If I had delayed my return by another day, itmight have been too late.</p>

    <p class="Chap">SPREAD BY THE CHATTERING SLAVE GIRLS, the news of my miraculous return from the grave swept through the island like the smallpox.</p>

    <p>Before nightfall Pharaoh sent Aton to fetch me to an audience. Even my old friend Aton was ??? strained and reserved in my presence. He leaped away nimbly when I tried to touch him, as though my hand might pass through his flesh like a puff of smoke. As he led me through the palace, slaves and nobles alike scurried out of my path, and inquisitive faces watched me from every window and dark comer as we passed.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh greeted me with a curious mixture of respect and nervousness, most alien to a king and a god.</p>

    <p>‘Where have you been, Taita?’ he asked, as though he did not really want to hear the answer.</p>

    <p>I prostrated myself at his feet. ‘Divine Pharaoh, as you yourself are part of the godhead, I understand that you ask that question to test me. You know that my lips are sealed. It would be sacrilege for me to speak of these mysteries, even to you. Please convey to the other deities who are your peers, and particularly to Anubis, the god of the cemeteries, that I have been true to the charge laid upon me. That I have kept the oath of silence imposed upon me. Tell them that I have passed the test that you set me.’</p>

    <p>His expression glazed as he considered this, and he fidgeted nervously. I could see him forming question after question, and then discarding each of them in turn. I had left him no opening to exploit.</p>

    <p>In the end he blurted out lamely, ‘Indeed, Taita, you have passed the test I set you. Welcome back. You have been missed.’ But I could see that all his suspicions were confirmed, and he treated me with that respect due to one who had solved the ultimate mystery.</p>

    <p>I crawled closer to him and dropped my voice to a whisper. ‘Great Egypt, you know the reason I have been sent back?’</p>

    <p>He looked mystified, but nodded uncertainly. I came to my feet and glanced around suspiciously, as though I expected to be overlooked by supernatural forces. I made the sign against evil before I went on, ‘The Lady Lostris. Her illness was caused by the direct influence of?’ I could not say the name, but made the horn sign with two fingers, the sign of the dark god, Seth.</p>

    <p>His expression changed from confusion to dread, and he shivered involuntarily and drew closer to me, as if for protection, as I went on, ‘Before I was taken away, my mistress was already carrying in her womb the treasure of the House of Mamose when the Dark One intervened. Due to her illness, the son she was bearing you has been aborted from her womb.’</p>

    <p>Pharaoh looked distraught. ‘So that is the reason that she miscarried,’ he began, and then broke off.</p>

    <p>I picked up my cue smoothly. ‘Never fear, Great Egypt, I have been sent back by forces greater than those of the Dark One to save her, so that the destiny that I foresaw in the Mazes of Ammon-Ra may run its allotted course. There will be another son to replace the one that was lost. Your dynasty will still be secured.’</p>

    <p>‘You must not leave the side of the Lady Lostris until she is well again.’ His voice shook with emotion. ‘If you save her and she bears me another son, you may ask from me whatever you wish, but if she dies?’ he stopped as he considered what threat might impress one who had already returned from beyond, and in the end let it trail away.</p>

    <p>‘With your permission, Your Majesty, I shall go to her this instant.’</p>

    <p>‘This instant!’he agreed.’Go! Go!’</p>

    <p class="Chap">MY MISTRESS’S RECOVERY WAS SO SWIFT that I began to suspect that I had unwittingly invoked some force beyond my own comprehension, and I felt a superstitious awe at my own powers.</p>

    <p>Her flesh filled out and firmed almost as I ??? watched. Those pitiful empty sacs of skin swelled into plump, round breasts once again, sweet enough to make the stone image of the god Hapi which stood at the doorway to her chamber burn with envy. Fresh young blood suffused the chalk of her skin until it glowed once more, and her laughter tinkled like the fountains of our water-garden.</p>

    <p>Very soon it was impossible to keep her to her bed. Within three weeks of my return to Elephantine, she was playing games of toss with her handmaidens, dancing about the garden and leaping high to reach the inflated bladder above the heads of the others, until, fearful that she might overtax her returning strength, I confiscated the ball and ordered her back to her chamber. She” would obey me only after we had struck another bargain, and I had agreed to sing with her, or teach her the most arcane formulas of the bao board which would allow her to enjoy her first victory over Aton, who was an addict of the game.</p>

    <p>Aton came almost every evening to enquire about my mistress’s health on behalf of the king, and afterwards to play the board-game with us. Aton seemed to have decided at last that I was not a dangerous ghost, and although he treated me with a new respect, our old friendship survived my demise.</p>

    <p>Each morning my Lady Lostris made me repeat my promise to her. Then she would reach for her mirror and study her reflection without the faintest trace of vanity, assessing every facet of her beauty to determine if it was ready yet to be looked upon by Lord Tanus.</p>

    <p>‘My hair looks like straw, and there is another pimple coming up on my chin,’ she lamented. ‘Make me beautiful again, Taita. For Tanus’ sake make me beautiful.’</p>

    <p>‘You have done the damage to yourself, and then you call for Taita to make it better,’ I grumbled, and she laughed and threw her arms around my neck.</p>

    <p>‘That’s what you are here for, you old scallywag. To look after me.’</p>

    <p>Each Evening when I mixed a tonic for her and brought the steaming bowl to her as she prepared for sleep, she would make me repeat my promise to her. ‘Swear you will bring Tanus to me, just as soon as I am ready to receive him.’</p>

    <p>I tried to ignore the difficulties and the dangers that this promise would bring upon us all. ‘I swear it to you,’ I repeated dutifully, and she lay back against the ivory headrest and went to sleep with a smile upon her face. I would worry about fulfilling my promise when the time came.</p>

    <p class="Chap">FROM ATON, PHARAOH HAD A FULL REPORT of Lostris’ recovery and came in person to visit her. He brought her a new necklace of gold and lapis lazuli in the form of an eagle and sat until evening, playing word-games and setting riddles with her. When he was ready to leave, he called me to walk with him as far as his chambers.</p>

    <p>‘The change in her is extraordinary. It is a miracle, Taita.</p>

    <p>When can I take her to bed again? Already she seems well enough to bear my son and heir.’</p>

    <p>‘Not yet, Great Egypt,’ I assured him vehemently. ‘The slightest exertion on the part of my mistress might trigger a relapse.’ He no longer questioned my word, for now I spoke with all the authority of the once dead, although his previous awe of me had worn a little thin with familiarity.</p>

    <p>The slave girls also were becoming accustomed to my resurrection, and were able to look at my face without having to make the sign. Indeed, my return from the underworld was no longer the most popular fare of the palace gossips. They had something else to keep them busy. This was die advent of Akh-Horus into the lives and consciousness of every person living in the land along the great river.</p>

    <p>The first time I heard the name Akh-Horus whispered in the palace corridors, I did not immediately place it. The garden of Tiamat beside the Red Sea seemed so remote from the little world of Elephantine, and I had forgottetfcthe name that Hui had bestowed on Tanus. When, howeva, I heard the accounts of the extraordinary deeds ascribed to this demi-god, I realized who they were speaking about.</p>

    <p>In a fever of excitement, I ran all the way back to the harem and found my mistress in the garden, besieged by a dozen visitors, noble ladies and royal wives, for she had so far recovered from her illness as to resume once more her role as court favourite.</p>

    <p>I was so wrought up that I forgot my place as a mere slave, and to be rid of .them I was quite rude to the royal ladies. They flounced out of the garden squawking like a gaggle of offended geese, and my mistress rounded on me. “That was unlike you. What on earth has come over you, Taita?’</p>

    <p>‘Tanus!’ I said the name like an incantation, and she forgot all her indignation and seized both my hands.</p>

    <p>‘You have news of Tanus! Tell me! Quickly, before I die of impatience.’</p>

    <p>‘News? Yes, I have news of him. What news! What extraordinary news. What unbelievable news!’</p>

    <p>She dropped my hands and picked up her formidable silver fan. ‘Stop your nonsense this instant,’ she threatened me with it. ‘I’ll not put up with your teasing. Tell me, or I swear you’ll have more lumps on your head than a Nubian has fleas.’</p>

    <p>‘Come! Let’s go where nobody can hear us.’ I led her down to the jetty and handed her into our little skiff. Out in the middle of the river we were safe from the flapping ears that lurked behind each corner of the palace walls.</p>

    <p>“There is a fresh, clean wind blowing through the land,’</p>

    <p>I told her. ‘They call this wind Akh-Horus.’</p>

    <p>‘The brother of Horus,’ she breathed it with reverence. ‘Is this what they call Tanus now?’</p>

    <p>‘None of them know it is Tanus. They think he is a god.’ ‘He is a god,’ she insisted. ‘To me, he is a god.’ ‘That is how they see it also. If he were not a god, how then would he know where the Shrikes are skulking, how else would he march unerringly to their strongholds, how would he know instinctively where they are waiting to wayr lay the incoming caravans, and to surprise them in their own ambuscades?’</p>

    <p>‘Has he accomplished all these things?’ she demanded in wonder.</p>

    <p>‘These deeds and a hundred others, if you can believe the wild rumours that are flying about the palace. They say that every thief and bandit in the land runs in terror of his life, that the clans of the Shrikes are being shattered one by one. They say that Akh-Horus sprouted wings, like those of an eagle, and flew up the inaccessible cliffs of Gebel-Umm-Bahari to appear miraculously in the midst of the clan of Basti the Cruel. With his own hands, he hurled five hundred of the bandits from the top of the cliffs?’</p>

    <p>‘Tell me more!’ She clapped her hands, almost capsizing the skiff in her enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>“They say that at every crossroads and beside every caravan route he has built tall monuments to his passing.’ ‘Monuments? What monuments are these?’ ‘Piles of human skulls, high pyramids of skulls. The heads of the bandits he has slain, as a warning to others.’</p>

    <p>My mistress shuddered with delicious horror, but her face still shone. ‘Has he killed so many?’ she demanded.</p>

    <p>‘Some say he has slain five thousand, and some say fifty thousand. There are even some who say one hundred thousand, but I think those must be exaggerating a little.’ ‘Tell me more! More!’</p>

    <p>“They say he has already captured at least six of the robber barons?’</p>

    <p>‘And chopped off their heads!’ she anticipated me with ghoulish relish.</p>

    <p>‘No, they say that he has not killed them, but transformed them into baboons. They say he keeps them in a cage for his amusement.’</p>

    <p>‘Is all of this possible?’ she giggled.</p>

    <p>‘For a god, anything is possible.’</p>

    <p>‘He is my god. Oh, Taita, when will you let me see him?’</p>

    <p>‘Soon,’ I promised. ‘Your beauty burns up brighter every day. Soon it will be fully restored.’</p>

    <p>‘In the meantime you must gather every story and every rumour of Akh-Horus and bring them to me.’</p>

    <p>She sent me to the shipping wharf every day to question the crews of the barges coming down from theg north for news of Akh-Horus.</p>

    <p>‘They are saying now that nobody has ever seen the face of Akh-Horus, for he wears a helmet with a visor that covers all but his eyes. They say also that in the heat of battle the head of Akh-Horus bursts into flame, a flame that blinds his enemies,’ I reported to her after one such visit.</p>

    <p>‘In the sunlight I have seen Tanus’ hair seem to burn with a heavenly light,’ my mistress confirmed.</p>

    <p>On another morning I could tell her, “They say that he can multiply his earthly body like the images in a mirror, that he can be in many” different places at one time, for on the same day he can be seen in Qena and Kom-Ombo, a hundred miles apart.’</p>

    <p>‘Is that possible?’ she asked, with awe.</p>

    <p>‘Some say this is not true. They say that he can cover these great distances only because he never sleeps. They say that in the night hours he gallops through the darkness on the back of a lion, and in the day he soars through the sky on the back of an enormous white eagle to fall upon his enemies when they least expect it.’</p>

    <p>“That could be true.’ She nodded seriously. ‘I do not believe about the mirror images, but the lion and the eagle might be true. Tanus could do something like that. I believe it.’</p>

    <p>‘I think it more likely that everybody in Egypt is eager to set eyes upon Akh-Horus, and that the desire is father to the act. They see him behind every bush. As to the speed of his travels, well, I have marched with the guards and I can vouch for?’ She would not allow me to finish, but interrupted primly.</p>

    <p>“There is no romance in your soul, Taita. You would doubt that the clouds are the fleece of Osiris’ flocks, and that the sun is the face of Ra, simply because you cannot reach up and touch them. I, for my part, believe Tanus is capable of all these things.’ Which assertion put an end to the argument, and I hung my head in submission.</p>

    <p class="Chap">IN THE AFTERNOONS THE TWO OF US RESUMED our old practice of strolling through the streets and the market-places. As before her illness, “rny mistress was welcomed by an adoring populace, and she stopped to speak with all of them, no matter their station or their calling. From priests to prostitutes, none was immune to her loveliness and her unfeigned charm.</p>

    <p>Always she was able to turn the conversation to Akh-Horus, and the people were as eager as she was to discuss the new god. By this time he had been promoted in the popular imagination from demi-god to a full member of the pantheon. The citizens of Elephantine had already begun a subscription for the building of a temple to Akh-Horus, to which my mistress had made a most generous donation.</p>

    <p>A site for the temple had been chosen on the bank of the river opposite the temple of Horus, his brother, and Pharaoh had made the formal declaration of his intention to dedicate the building in person. Pharaoh had every reason to be grateful. There was a new spirit of confidence abroad. As the caravan routes were made secure, so the volume of trade between the Upper Kingdom and the rest of the world blossomed.</p>

    <p>Where before one caravan had arrived from the East, now four made a safe crossing of the desert, and as many set out on the return journey. To supply the caravan masters, pack-donkeys were needed in their thousands, and the farmers and breeders drove them into the cities, grinning at the expectation of the high prices they would receive.</p>

    <p>Because it was now safe to work the fields furthest from the protection of the city walls, crops were planted where for decades only weeds had grown, and the farmers, who had been reduced to beggars, began to prosper again. The oxen drew the sledges piled high with produce along the roads that were now protected by the legions of Akh-Horus, and the markets were filled with fresh produce.</p>

    <p>Some of the profits of the merchants and the land-owners from these ventures were spent in the building of new villas in the countryside, where it was once more deemed safe to take their families to live. Artisans and craftsmen, who had walked the streets of Thebes and Elephantine seeking employment for their skills, were suddenly in demand, and used their wages to buy not only the necessities of life but luxuries for themselves and their families. The markets were thronged.</p>

    <p>The volume of traffic up and down the Nile swelled dramatically, so that more craft were needed, and the new keels were laid down in every shipyard. The captains and crews of the river boats and the shipyard workers spent their new wealth in the taverns and pleasure-houses, so that the prostitutes and the courtesans clamoured for fine clothes and baubles, and the tailors and the jewellers thrived and built new homes, while their wives prowled the markets with gold and silver in their purses, looking for everything from new slaves to cooking-pots.</p>

    <p>Egypt was coming to life again, after being strangled for all these years by the depredations of Akh-Seth and the Shrikes.</p>

    <p>As a result of all this, the state revenues burgeoned, and Pharaoh’s tax-collectors circled above it all with as much relish as the vultures above the corpses of the bandits that Akh-Horus and his legions were strewing across the countryside. Of course, Pharaoh was grateful.</p>

    <p>So were my mistress and I. At my suggestion, the two of us invested in a share of a trading expedition that was setting out eastwards into Syria. When the expedition returned six months later, we found that we had made a profit of fifty times our original investment. My mistress bought herself a string of pearls and five new female slaves to make my life miserable. Prudent as always, I used my share to acquire five plots of prime land on the east bank of the river, and one of (the law scribes drew up the deeds and had them registered in the temple books.</p>

    <p class="Chap">THEN CAME THE DAY THAT I HAD BEEN dreading. One morning my mistress studied her reflection in the mirror with even more attention than usual, and declared that she was ready at last. In all fairness, I had grudgingly to agree that she had never looked more lovely. It was as though all she had suffered recently had tempered her to a new resilience. The last traces of girlishness, uncertainty, and puppy fat had evaporated from her features, and she had become a woman, mature and composed.</p>

    <p>‘I trusted you, Taita. Now prove to me that I was not silly to do so. Bring Tanus to me.’</p>

    <p>When Tanus and I had parted at Safaga, we had been unable to agree on any sure method of exchanging messages.</p>

    <p>‘I will be on the march every day, and who can tell where this campaign will lead me. Do not let the Lady Lostris worry if she does not hear from me. Tell her I will send a message when my task is completed. But tell her that I will be there when the fruits of our love are ripe upon the tree, and are ready for plucking.’</p>

    <p>Thus it was that we had heard nothing of him other than the wild rumours of the wharves and bazaars.</p>

    <p>Once again it seemed that the gods had intervened to save me, this time from the wrath of my Lady Lostris. There was a fresh rumour in the market-place that day. A caravan coming down the northern road had encountered a recently erected pyramid of human heads at the roadside not two miles beyond the city walls. The heads were so fresh that they were stinking only a little and had not yet been cleaned of flesh by the crows and vultures.</p>

    <p>‘This means only one thing,’ the gossips told each other. “This means that Akh-Horus is in the nome of Assoun, probably within sight of the walls of Elephantine. He has fallen upon the remnants of the clan of Akheku, who have been skulking in the desert since their baron had his head hacked off at Gallala. Akh-Horus has slaughtered the last of the bandits, and piled their heads at the roadside. Thanks be to the new god, the south has been cleared of the dreaded Shrikes!’</p>

    <p>This was news indeed, the best I had heard in weeks, and I was in a fever to take it to my mistress. I pushed my way through the throng of sailors and merchants and fishermen on the wharf to find a boatman to take me back to the island.</p>

    <p>Somebody tugged at my arm, and I shrugged the hand away irritably. Despite the new prosperity sweeping the land, or perhaps because of it, the beggars were more demanding than ever. This one was not so easily put off, and I turned back to him, angrily raising my staff to drive him off.</p>

    <p>‘Do not strike an old friend! I have a message for you from one of the gods,’ the beggar whined, and I stayed the blow and gaped at him.</p>

    <p>‘Hui!’ My heart soared as I recognized the sly grin of the erstwhile robber. ‘What are you doing here?’ I did not wait for a reply to my fatuous question, but went on swiftly, ‘Follow me at a distance.’</p>

    <p>I led him to one of the pleasure-houses in a narrow alley beyond the harbour that provided rooms to couples, of the same or of mixed gender. They rented the rooms for a short period measured by a water-clock set at the door, and charged a large copper ring for this service. I paid this exorbitant fee and the moment we were alone, I seized Hui by his ragged cloak.</p>

    <p>‘What news of your master?’ I demanded, and he chuckled with infuriating insolence.</p>

    <p>‘My throat is so dry I can hardly speak.’ Already he had adopted all the swagger and insolent panache of a trooper of the Blues. How quickly a monkey learns new tricks! I shouted for the porter to bring up a pot of beer. Hui drank like a thirsty donkey, then lowered the pot and belched happily.</p>

    <p>‘The god Akh-Horus sends greetings, to you and to another whose name cannot be mentioned. He bids me tell you that the task is completed and that all the birds are in the cage. He reminds you that it lacks only a few months to the next festival of Osiris and it is time to write a new script for the passion play for the amusement of the king.’</p>

    <p>‘Where is he? How long will it take for you to return to him?’ I demanded eagerly.</p>

    <p>‘I can’ be with him before Ammon-Ra, the sun god, plunges beyond the western hills,’ Hui declared, and I glanced through the window at the sun which was halfway down the sky. Tanus was lying up very close to the city, and I rejoiced anew. How I longed to feel his rough embrace, and hear that great booming laugh of his!</p>

    <p>Grinning to myself in anticipation, I paced up and down the filthy floor of the room while I decided on the message that I would give Hui to take back to him.</p>

    <p class="Chap">IT WAS ALMOST DARK WHEN I STEPPED ashore on our little jetty and hurried up the steps. One of the slave girls was weeping at the gate, and rubbing her swollen ear.</p>

    <p>‘She struck me,’ the girl whimpered, and I saw that her dignity had suffered more than her ear. not refer to the Lady Lostris as “she”,’ I scolded her. ‘Anyway, what have you to complain of? Slaves are there to be struck.’</p>

    <p>None the less, it was unusual for my mistress to lift a hand to anyone in her household. She must indeed be in a fine mood, I thought, and slowed my pace. Proceeding warily now, I arrived just as another of the girls fled weeping from the chamber. My mistress appeared in the doorway behind her, flushed with anger. ‘You have turned my hair into a hay-stack?’</p>

    <p>She saw me then and broke off her tirade. She rounded on me with such gusto that I knew that I was the true object of her ire.</p>

    <p>‘Where have you been?’ she demanded. ‘I sent you to the harbour before noon. How dare you leave me waiting so long?’ She advanced upon me with such an expression that I backed off nervously.</p>

    <p>‘He is here,’ I told.her hastily, and then dropped my voice so that none of the slave girls could hear me. ‘Tanus is here,’ I whispered, ‘the day after tomorrow I will make good my promise to you.’</p>

    <p>Her mood swung in a full circle and she leaped up to throw her arms around my neck, then she went off to find her offended girls and to comfort them.</p>

    <p class="Chap">AS PART OF HIS ANNUAL TRIBUTE THE vassal king of the amorites had sent Pharaoh a pair of trained hunting cheetahs from his kingdom across the Red Sea. The king was eager to run these magnificent creatures against the herds of gazelle that abounded in the desert dunes of the west bank. The entire court, including my mistress, had been commanded to attend the course.</p>

    <p>We sailed across to the west bank in a fleet of small river craft, white sails and bright-coloured pennants fluttering. There was laughter and the music of lute and sistrum to accompany us. The annual flooding of the great river would begin within days, and this expectation, together with the prosperous new climate of the land, enhanced the carnival mood of the court.</p>

    <p>My mistress was in a gayer mood than any of them, and she called merry greetings to her friends in the other boats as our felucca cut through the green summer waters at such a rate as to deck our bows with a lacy white garland of foam and leave a shining wake behind us.</p>

    <p>It seemed that I was the only one who was not happy and carefree. The wind had a harsh, abrasive edge to it, and was blowing from the wrong quarter. I kept glancing anxiously at the western sky. It was cloudless and bright, but there was a brassy sheen to the heavens that was unnatural. It was almost as though another sun was dawning from the opposite direction to the one we knew so well.</p>

    <p>I put aside my misgivings and tried to enter into the spirit of the outing. I failed in this, for I had more than the weather to worry about. If one part of my plan went awry, my life would be in danger, and perhaps other lives more valuable than mine would be at risk.</p>

    <p>I must have shown all this on my face, for my mistress nudged me with her pretty painted toe and told me, ‘So glum, Taita? Everyone who looks at you will know that you are up to something. Smile! I command you to smile.’</p>

    <p>When we landed on the west bank, there was an army of slaves waiting for us there. Grooms holding splendid white riding donkeys from the royal stables, all caparisoned with silk. Pack-donkeys laden with tents and rugs and baskets of food and’wine, and all the other provisions for a royal picnic. There was a regiment of slaves in attendance, some to hold sun-shades above the ladies, others to wait upon the noble guests. There were clowns and acrobats and musicians to entertain them, and a hundred huntsmen to provide the sport.</p>

    <p>The cheetah cage was loaded on a sledge drawn by a team of white oxen, and the court gathered around the vehicle to admire these rare beasts. They did not occur naturally in our land, for they were creatures of the open grassy savannah, and there was none of this type of terrain along the river. They were the first that I had ever seen, and my curiosity was so aroused that for a while I forgot my other worries and went up as close to the cage as I could push through the crowd without jostling or treading on the toes of some irascible nobleman.</p>

    <p>They were the most beautiful cats that I could imagine, taller and leaner than our leopards, with long, clean limbs and concave bellies. Their sinuous tails seemed to give expression to their mood. Their golden hides were starred with rosettes of deepest black, while from the inner corner of each of their eyes, a line of black was painted down the cheek like a runnel of tears. This, with their regal bearing, gave them a tragic and romantic air that I found enchanting. I longed to own one of these creatures, and I decided on the moment to put the thought into the mind of my mistress. Pharaoh had never refused one of her whims.</p>

    <p>Too soon for my liking, the barque carrying the king across the river arrived on the west bank, and with the rest of the court we hurried to the landing to greet him.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh was dressed in light hunting garb and for once seemed relaxed and happy. He stopped beside my mistress and while she made a ritual obeisance, he enquired graciously about her health. I was filled with dread that he might decide to keep her by his side throughout the day, which would have upset all my arrangements. However, the hunting cheetah caught his attention and he passed by without giving my mistress any order to follow.</p>

    <p>We lost ourselves in the throng and made our way to where a donkey was being held for my Lady Lostris. While I helped her to mount, I spoke quietly to the groom. When he told me what I wanted to hear, I slipped a ring of silver into his hand, and it disappeared, as though by magic.</p>

    <p>With one slave leading her and another holding a sunshade over her, my mistress and I followed the king and the sledge out into the desert. With frequent stops for refreshment, it took us half the morning to reach the Valley of the Gazelles. On the way we passed at a distance the ancient cemetery of Tras which dated from the time of the very first pharaohs. Some of the wise men said that the tombs had been carved from the cliff of black rock three thousand years ago, although how they reached this conclusion I could not tell. Without making it obvious, I studied the entrances of the tombs keenly as we passed. However, from so far off I could make out no trace of recent human presence around them, and I was unreasonably disappointed. I kept glancing back, as we went on.</p>

    <p>The Valley of the Gazelles was one of the royal hunting preserves, protected by the decrees of a long line of pharaohs. A company of royal gamekeepers was permanently stationed in the hills above the valley to enforce the king’s proclamation reserving all the creatures in it to himself. The penalty for hunting here Without the royal authority was death by strangulation.</p>

    <p>The nobles dismounted on the crest of one of these hills overlooking the broad brown valley. With despatch the tents were set up to give them shade, and jars of sherbet and beer were broached to slake the thirst of their journey.</p>

    <p>I made certain that my mistress and I secured a good vantage-point from which to watch the hunt, but one from which we could also withdraw discreetly without attracting undue attention to ourselves. In the distance I could make out the herds of gazelle through the wavering watery mirage on the floor of the valley. I pointed them out to my mistress.</p>

    <p>‘What do they find to eat down there?’ my Lady Lostris asked. ‘There is not a trace of green. They must eat stones, for there are enough of those.’</p>

    <p>‘Many of those are not stones at all, but living plants,’ I told her. When she laughed in disbelief, I searched the rocky ground and. plucked a handful of those miraculous plants.</p>

    <p>“They are stones,’ she insisted, until she held one in her hand and crushed it. The thick juice trickled over her fingers, and she marvelled at the cunning of whatever god had devised this deception. “This is what they live on? It does not seem possible.’</p>

  <div>
    <p>We could not continue this conversation, because the hunt was beginning. Two of the royal huntsmen opened the cage and the hunting cheetahs leaped down to earth. I expected them to attempt to escape, but they were tame as temple cats and rubbed themselves affectionately against the legs of then- handlers. The cats uttered a strange twittering sound, more like a bird than a savage predator.</p>

    <p>Along the far side of the brown, scorched valley bottom I could make out the line of beaters, their forms tiny and distorted by distance and mirage. They were moving slowly in our direction, and the herds of antelope were beginning to drift ahead of them.</p>

    <p>While the king and his huntsmen, with the cheetahs on leash, moved down the slope towards the valley bottom, we and the rest of the court remained on the crest. The courtiers were already placing wagers with one another, and I was as eager as any of them to watch the outcome of the hunt, but my mistress had her mind on other matters.</p>

    <p>‘When can we go?’ she whispered. ‘When can we escape into the desert?’</p>

    <p>‘Once the hunt begins, all their eyes will be upon it. That will be our opportunity.’ Even as I spoke, the wind that had blown us across the river and cooled us on the march suddenly dropped. It was as though a coppersmith had opened the door of his forge. The air became almost too hot to breathe.</p>

    <p>Once again I looked to the western horizon. The sky above it had turned a sulphurous yellow. Even as I watched, the stain seemed to spread across the heavens. It made me uneasy. However, I was the only one in the crowd who seemed to notice this strange phenomenon.</p>

    <p>Although the hunting party was now at the bottom of the hill, it was still close enough for me to observe the great cats. They had seen the herds of gazelle which were being driven slowly towards them. This had transformed them from affectionate pets into the savage hunters they truly were. Their heads were up, intent and alert, ears pricked forward, leaning against the leash. Their concave bellies were sucked in, and every muscle was taut as a bowstring drawn to full stretch.</p>

    <p>My mistress tugged at my skirt, and whispered imperatively, ‘Let us be gone, Taita,’ and reluctantly I began to edge away towards a clump of rocks that would cover our retreat and screen us from the rest of the company. The bribe of silver to the groom had procured for us a donkey that was now tethered out of sight amongst the rocks. As soon as we reached it, I checked that it carried what I had ordered, the water-skin and the leather bag of provisions. I found that they were all in order.</p>

    <p>I could not restrain myself, and I pleaded with my mistress, ‘Just one moment more.’ Before she could forbid it, I scrambled to the top of the rocky outcrop and peeped down into the valley below.</p>

    <p>The nearest antelope were crossing a few hundred paces in front of where Pharaoh held the pair of cheetahs on the leash. I was just in time to watch him slip them and send them away. They started out at an easy lope, heads up, as if they were studying the herds of daintily trotting antelope to select their prey. Suddenly the herds became aware of their rapid approach, and they burst into full flight. Like a flock of swallows they skimmed away across the dusty plain.</p>

    <p>The cats stretched out their long bodies, reaching far ahead with their forepaws and then whipping their hindquarters through, doubling their lean torsos before stretching out again. Swiftly they built up to the top of their speed, and I had never seen an animal so swift. Compared to them, the herds of gazelle seemed suddenly to have run into swampy ground and to have had their flight impeded. With effortless elegance, the two cats overhauled the herd, and ran past one or two stragglers before they caught up with the victims of their choice.</p>

    <p>The panic-stricken antelopes tried to dodge the deadly rush. They leaped high and changed direction in mid-air, twisting and doubling back the moment their dainty hooves touched the scorched earth. The cats followed each of the convolutions with graceful ease, and the end was inevitable.</p>

    <p>Each of them bore one of die gazelle to earth in a sliding, tumbling cloud of dust, and then crouched over it, jaws clamped across the windpipe to strangle it-while the gazelle’s back legs kicked out convulsively, and then at last stiffened into the rigor of death.</p>

    <p>I found myself shaken and breathless with the excitement of it all. Then my mistress’s voice roused me. ‘Taita! Come down immediately. They will see you perched up there.’ And I slid down to rejoin her.</p>

    <p>Although I was still wrought up, I boosted her into the saddle and led the donkey down into the dead ground where we were out of sight of the company on the hilltop behind us. My mistress could not sustain her irritation with me for very long, and when I slyly mentioned Tanus’ name again she forgot it entirely, and urged her mount on towards the rendezvous.</p>

    <p>Only after I had placed another ridge behind us and was certain that we were well clear of the Valley of the Gazelles, did I head back directly towards the cemetery of Tras. In the still, hot air, the sound of our donkey’s hooves clinked and crackled on the stones as though it were passing over a bed of broken glass. Soon I felt the sweat break out upon my skin, for the air was close and heavy with a feeling of thunder. Long before we reached the tombs, I told my mistress, ‘The air is dry as old bones. You should drink a little water?’</p>

    <p>‘Keep on! There will be plenty of time to drink your fill later.’</p>

    <p>‘I was thinking only of you? mistress,’ I protested.</p>

    <p>‘We must not be late. Every moment you waste will give me that much less with Tanus.’ She was right, of course, for we would have little enough time before we were missed by the others. My mistress was so popular that many would be looking to enjoy her company once the hunt was over and they were returning to the river.</p>

    <p>As we drew closer to the cliffs, so her eagerness increased until she could no longer abide the pace of her mount. She leaped off its back and ran ahead to the next rise. ‘There it is! That is where he will be waiting for me,” she cried, and pointed ahead.</p>

    <p>As she danced on the skyline, the wind came at us like a ravening wolf, howling amongst the hills and canyons. It caught my mistress’s hair and spread it like a flag, snapping and tangling it around her head. It lifted her skirts high above her slim brown thighs, and she laughed and pirouetted, flirting with the wind as though it were her lover. I did not share her delight.</p>

    <p>I turned and looked back and saw the storm coming out of the Sahara. It towered into the sullen yellow heavens, dun and awful, billowing upon itself like surf breaking on a coral reef. The wind-blown sand scoured my legs and I broke into a run, dragging the donkey behind me on its lead. The wind thrusting into my back almost knocked me off my feet, but I caught my mistress.</p>

    <p>‘We must be quick,’ I shouted above the wind. ‘We must reach the shelter of the tombs before it hits us.’</p>

    <p>High clouds of sand blew across the sun, dimming it until I could look directly at it with my naked eye. All the world was washed with that sombre shade of ochre, and the sun was a dull ball of orange. Flying sand raked the exposed skin of our limbs and the backs of our necks, until I wound my shawl around my mistress’s head to protect her, and led her forward by the hand.</p>

    <p>Sheets of driven sand engulfed us, blotting out our surroundings, so that I feared I had lost direction, until abruptly a hole opened in the curtains of sand, and I saw the dark mouth of one of the tombs appear ahead of us. Dragging my mistress with one hand and our donkey with the other, I staggered into tne shelter of the cave. The entrance-shaft was carved from the solid rock. It led us deep into the hillside, and then made a sharp turn before entering the burial chamber where once the ancient mummy had been laid to rest. Centuries before, the grave-robbers had disposed of the embalmed body and all its treasures. Now all that remained were the faded frescoes upon the stone walls, images- of gods and monsters that were ghostly in the gloom.</p>

    <p>My mistress sank down against the rock wall, but her first thoughts were for her love. ‘Tanus will never find us now,’ she cried in despair, and I who had led her to safety was hurt by her ingratitude. I unsaddled our donkey and heaped the load in a comer of the tomb. Then I drew a cup of water from the skin and made her drink.</p>

    <p>‘What will happen to the others, the king and all our friends?’ she asked, between gulps from the cup. It was her nature to think of the welfare of others, even in her own predicament.</p>

    <p>‘They have the huntsmen to care for them,’ I told her. “They are good men and know the desert.’ But not well enough to have anticipated the storm, I thought grimly. Although I sought to reassure her, I knew it would go hard with the women and children out there.</p>

    <p>‘And Tanus?’ she asked. ‘What will become of him?’ Tanus especially will know what to do. He is like one of the Bedouin. You can be sure he will have seen the storm coming.’</p>

    <p>‘Will we ever get back to the river? Will they ever find us here?’ At last she thought of her own safety.</p>

    <p>‘We will be safe here. We have water enough for many days. When the storm blows itself out, we will find our way back to the river.’ Thinking of the precious water, I carried the bulging skin further into the tomb, where the donkey would not trample it. By now it was almost completely dark, and I fumbled with the lamp that the slave had provided from the pack, and blew upon the smouldering wick. It flared and lit the tomb with a cheery yellow light.</p>

    <p>While I was still busy with the lamp and my back was turned to the entrance, my mistress screamed. It was a sound so high and filled with such mortal terror that I was struck with equal dread, and the courses of my blood ran thick and slow as honey, although my heart raced like the hooves of the flying gazelle. I spun about and reached for, my dagger, but when I saw the monster whose bulk filled the doorway, I froze without touching the weapon on my belt. I knew instinctively that my puny blade would avail us not at all against whatever this creature might be.</p>

    <p>In the feeble light of the lamp the form was indistinct and distorted. I saw that it had a human shape, but it was too large to be a man, and the grotesque head convinced me that this was indeed that dreadful crocodile-headed monster from the underworld that devours the hearts of those who are found wanting on the scales of Thoth, the monster depicted on the walls of the tomb. The head gleamed with reptilian scales, and the beak was that of an eagle or a gigantic turtle. The eyes were deep and fathomless pits that stared at us implacably. Great wings sprouted from its shoulders. Half-furled, they flapped about the towering body like those of a falcon at bate. I expected the creature to launch itself on those wings and to rend my mistress with brazen talons. She must have dreaded this as much as I, for she screamed again as she crouched at the monster’s feet.</p>

    <p>Then suddenly I realized that the creature was not winged, but that the folds of a long woollen cape, such as the Bedouin wear, were flogging on the wind. While we were still frozen by this horrible presence, it raised both hands and lifted off the gilded war helmet with the visor fashioned like the head of an eagle. Then it shook its head and a mass of red-gold curls tumbled down on to the broad shoulders.</p>

    <p>‘From the top of the eliff I saw you coming through the storm,’ it said in those dear familiar tones.</p>

    <p>My mistress screamed again, this time with wildly ringing joy. ‘Tanus!’</p>

    <p>She flew to him, and he gathered her up as though she were a child and lifted her so high that her head brushed the rock roof. Then he brought her down and folded her to his chest. From the cradle of his arms, she reached up with her mouth for his, and it seemed that they might devour each other with the strength of their need.</p>

    <p>I stood forgotten in the shadows of the tomb. Although I had conspired and risked so much to bring them together, I cannot bring myself to write down here the feelings that assailed me as I was made reluctant witness to their rapture. I believe that jealousy is the most ignoble of all our emotions, and yet I loved the Lady Lostris as well as Tanus did, and not with the love of a father or of a brother, either. I was a eunuch, but what I felt for her was the love of a natural man, hopeless of course, but all the more bitter because of that. I could not stay and watch them and I began to slink from the tomb like a whipped puppy, but Tanus saw me leaving and broke that kiss which was threatening to destroy my soul.</p>

    <p>‘Taita, don’t leave me alone with the wife of the king. Stay with us to protect me from this terrible temptation. Our honour is in jeopardy. I cannot trust myself, you must stay and see that I bring no shame to the wife of Pharaoh.’</p>

    <p>‘Go,’ cried my Lady Lostris from his arms. ‘Leave us alone. I’ll listen to no talk of shame or honour now. Our love has been too long denied. I cannot wait for the prophecy of the Mazes to run its course. Leave us alone now, gentle Taita.’</p>

    <p>I fled from the chamber as though my life was in danger. I might have run out into the storm and perished there. That way I would have found surcease, but I was too much of a coward, and I let the wind drive me back. I stumbled to a corner of the shaft where the wind could no longer harry me, and I sank to the stone floor. I pulled my shawl over my head to stop my eyes and my ears, but although the storm roared along the cliff, it could not drown the sounds from the burial chamber.</p>

    <p>For two days the storm blew with unabated ferocity. I slept for part of that time, forcing myself to seek oblivion, but whenever I awoke, I could hear them, and the sounds of their love tortured me. Strange that I had never known such distress when my mistress was with the king?but then on the other hand not so strange, for the old man had meant nothing to her.</p>

    <p>This was another world of torment for me. The cries, the groans, the whispers tore at my heart. The rhythmic sobs of a young woman that were not those of pain threatened to destroy me. Her wild scream of final rapture was more agonizing to me than the cut of the gelding-knife.</p>

    <p>At last the wind abated and died away, moaning at the foot of the cliffs. The light strengthened and I realized that it was the third day of my incarceration in the tomb. I roused myself and called to them, not daring to enter the inner chamber for fear of what I might discover. For a while there was no .reply, and then my mistress spoke in a husky, bemused voice that echoed eerily down the shaft. ‘Taita, is that you? I thought that I had died in the storm and been carried to the western fields of paradise.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">ONCE THE STORM HAD DROPPED, WE HAD little time remaining. The royal huntsmen would already be searching for us. The storm had given us the best possible excuse for our absence. I was sure that the survivors of the hunting party would be scattered across these terrible hills. But the search-party must not discover us in the company of Tanus.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Tanus and I had barely spoken during these last days, and there was much to discuss. Hastily we made our plans, standing in the entrance to the shaft.</p>

    <p>My mistress was quiet and composed as I had seldom seen her before. No longer the irrepressible chatterbox, she stood beside Tanus, watching his face with a new serenity. She reminded me of a priestess serving before the image of her god. Her eyes never left his face, and occasionally she reached out to touch him, as if to reassure herself that it was truly he.</p>

    <p>When she did this, Tanus broke off whatever he was saying and gave all his attention to those dark green eyes. I had to call him back to the business we still had not completed. In the presence of such manifest adoration, my own feelings were base arid mean. I forced myself to rejoice for them.</p>

    <p>It took longer to finish our business than I deemed wise, but at last I embraced Tanus in farewell and urged the donkey out into the sunlight that was filtered by the fine yellow dust that still filled the air. My mistress lingered, and I waited for her in the valley below.</p>

    <p>Looking back, I saw them emerge from the cave at last. They stood gazing at each other for a long moment without touching, and then Tanus turned and strode away. My mistress watched until he was gone from her sight, then she came down to where I waited. She walked like a woman in a dream.</p>

    <p>I helped her to mount, and while I adjusted the saddle girth, she reached down and took my hand. ‘Thank you,’ she said simply.</p>

    <p>‘I do not deserve your gratitude,’ I demurred.</p>

    <p>‘I am the happiest creature in all the world. Everything that you told me of love is true. Please rejoice for me, even though?’ she did not finish, and suddenly I realized that she had read my innermost feelings. Even in her own great joy, she grieved that she had caused me pain. I think I loved her more in that moment than I had ever done before.</p>

    <p>I turned away and took up the reins, and led her back towards the Nile.</p>

    <p class="Chap">ONE OF THE ROYAL HUNTSMEN SPIED US from a far hilltop, and hailed us heartily.</p>

    <p>‘We have been searching for you at the king’s command,’ he told us, as he hurried down to join us.</p>

    <p>‘Was the king saved?’ I asked. ‘He is safe in the palace on Elephantine Island, and he has commanded that the Lady Lostris be brought to him directly she is found.’</p>

    <p>As we set foot on the palace jetty, Aton was there, puffing out his painted cheeks with relief and fussing over my mistress. ‘They have found the bodies of twenty-three unfortunates who perished in the storm,’ he told us with ghoulish relish. ‘All were certain that you would be found dead also. However, I prayed at the temple of Hapi for your safe return.’ He looked pleased with himself, and I was annoyed that he tried to claim the credit for her survival for himself. He allowed us only time enough to wash hastily and anoint our dry skin with perfumed oil, before he whisked us away to the audience with the king.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh was truly moved to have my mistress returned to him. I am sure he had come to love her as much as any of the others, and not merely for the promise of immortality that he saw in her. A tear tangled in his eyelash and smeared the paint on his cheek as she knelt before him.</p>

    <p>‘I thought you were lost,’ he told her, and would have embraced her, had etiquette permitted it. ‘Instead I find you prettier and livelier than ever.’ Which was true, for love had gilded her with its special magic.</p>

    <p>‘Taita saved me,’ she told Pharaoh. ‘He guided me to a shelter and protected me through all those terrible days. Without him I would have perished, like those other poor souls.’</p>

    <p>‘Is this true, Taita?’ Pharaoh demanded of me directly, and I assumed my modest expression, and murmured, ‘I am but a humble instrument of the gods.’</p>

    <p>He smiled at me, for I knew he had become fond of me also. ‘You have rendered us many services, oh humble instrument. But this is the most valuable of them all. Approach!’ he commanded, and I knelt before him.</p>

    <p>Aton stood beside him, holding a small cedar-wood box. He lifted the lid and proffered it to the king. From the case Pharaoh lifted out a gold chain. It was of the purest unalloyed gold, and bore the marks of the royal jewellers to attest its weight of twenty deben.</p>

    <p>The king held the chain over my head and intoned, ‘I bestow upon you the Gold of Praise.’ He lowered it on to my shoulders, and the oppressive weight was a delight to me. This decoration was the highest mark of royal favour, usually reserved for generals and ambassadors, or for high officials such as Lord IntefV I doubted that ever in the history of this very Egypt had the gold chain been placed around the neck of a lowly slave.</p>

    <p>That was not the end of the gifts and awards that were to be bestowed upon me, for my mistress was not to be outdone. That evening while I was attending her bath, she suddenly dismissed her slaves and, standing naked before me, she told me, ‘You may help me to dress, Taita.’ She allowed me this privilege when she was especially well pleased with me. She knew just how much I enjoyed having her to myself in these intimate circumstances.</p>

    <p>Her loveliness was covered only by the glossy tresses of her sable hair. It seemed that those days she had spent with Tanus had filled her with a new quality of beauty. It emanated from deep within her. A lamp placed inside an alabaster jar will shine through the translucent sides; in the same way, the Lady Lostris seemed to glow.</p>

    <p>‘I never dreamed that such a poor vessel as this body of mine could contain such joy.’ She stroked her own flanks as she said it and looked down at herself, inviting me to do the same. ‘All that you promised me came to pass while I was with Tanus. Pharaoh has bestowed the Gold of Praise upon you, it is fitting that I also show my appreciation to you. I want you to share my happiness in some way.’</p>

    <p>‘Serving you is all the reward I could wish for.’ ‘Help me to dress,’ she ordered, and lifted her hands above her head. Her breasts changed shape as she moved. Over the year I had watched them grow from tiny immature figs into these round, creamy pomegranates, more beautiful than jewels or marble sculptures. I held the diaphanous nightdress over her, and then let it float down over her body. It covered her, but did not obscure her loveliness, in the same way that the morning mist decks the waters of the Nile in the dawn.</p>

    <p>‘I have commanded a banquet, and sent invitations to the royal ladies.’</p>

    <p>‘Very well, my lady. I shall see to it.’ ‘No, no, Taita. The banquet is in your honour. You will sit beside me as my guest.’</p>

    <p>This was as shocking as any of the wild schemes she had thought up recently. ‘It is not fitting, mistress. You will offend against custom.’</p>

    <p>‘I am the wife of Pharaoh. I set the customs. During the banquet I will have a gift for you, and I will present it to you in the sight of all.’</p>

    <p>‘Will you tell me what this gift is?’ I asked, with some trepidation. I was never sure of what mischief she would dream up next.</p>

    <p>‘Certainly I will tell you what it is.’ She smiled mysteriously. ‘It is a secret, that’s what it is.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">EVEN THOUGH I WAS THE GUEST OF HONOUR, I could not leave the arrangements for the banquet to cooks and giggling slave girls. After all, the reputation of my mistress as a hostess was at stake. I was at the market before dawn to procure the finest, freshest produce from the fields and the river. I promised Aton that he would be invited, and he opened the king’s wine cellar and let me make my selection. I hired and rehearsed the best musicians and acrobats in the city. I sent out the slaves to gather hyacinth and lily and lotus from the banks of the river to augment the masses of blooms that already decorated our garden. I had the weavers plait tiny arks of reeds on which I floated coloured glass lamps and set them adrift on the ponds of our water-garden. I set out leather cushions and garlands of flowers for each guest, and jars of perfumed oil to cool them in the sultry night and drive away the mosquitoes.</p>

    <p>At nightfall the royal ladies began to arrive in all their frippery and high fashion. Some of them had even shaved their heads and replaced their natural hair with elaborate wigs woven from the hair which the wives of the poor were forced to sell, in order to feed their brats. This was a fashion I abhorred and I vowed to do all in my power to prevent my mistress from succumbing to such folly. Her lustrous tresses were amongst my chief delights, but when it comes to fashion, even the most sensible woman is not to be trusted.</p>

    <p>When, at the insistence of my mistress, I seated myself on the cushion beside her, rather than taking my usual position behind her, I could see that many of our guests were scandalized by such indecorous behaviour, and they whispered to each other behind their fans. I was just as uncomfortable as they were, and to cover my embarrassment, I signalled the slaves to keep the wine cups filled, the musicians to play, and the dancers to dance.</p>

    <p>The wine was robust, the music rousing, and the dancers were all male. They gave ample proof of their gender, for I had ordered them to perform in a state of nature. The ladies were so enchanted by this display that they soon forgot their decent outrage, and did justice to the wine. I had no doubt that many of the male dancers would not leave the harem before dawn. Some of the royal ladies had voracious appetites, and many had not been visited by the king in years.</p>

    <p>In this convivial atmosphere my mistress rose to her feet and called (for the attention of her guests. Then she commended me to them in terms so extravagant that even I blushed. She went on to relate amusing and touching episodes from the lifetime we had spent together. The wine seemed to have softened the attitude of the women towards me, and they laughed and applauded. A few of them even wept a little with wine and sentiment.</p>

    <p>At last my mistress commanded me to kneel before her, and as I did so, there was a murmur of comment. I had chosen to wear a simple kilt of the finest linen, and the slave girls had dressed my hair in the fashion that best suited me. Apart from the Gold of Praise around my throat, I wore no other ornament. In the midst of such ostentation, my simple style was striking. With regular swimming and exercise I had kept the athletic body which had first attracted Lord Intef to me. In those years I was in my prime.</p>

    <p>I heard one of the senior wives murmur to her neighbour, ‘What a pity he has lost his jewels. He would make such a diverting toy.’ This evening I could ignore the words that in other circumstances would have caused me intense pain.</p>

    <p>My mistress was looking very pleased with herself. She had succeeded in keeping me ignorant of the nature of her gift. Usually she was not so adroit as to be able to outwit me. She looked down on my bowed head and spoke slowly and clearly, wringing the utmost enjoyment from the moment.</p>

    <p>‘Taita the slave. For all the years of my life you have been a shield over me. You have been my mentor and my tutor. You have taught me to read and to write. You have made clear to me the mysteries of the stars and the arcane arts. You have taught me to sing and to dance. You have shown me how to find happiness and contentment in many things. I am grateful.’</p>

    <p>The royal ladies were once more beginning to become restive. They had never before heard a slave praised in such effusive terms.</p>

    <p>‘On the day of the khamsin you did me a service that I must reward. Pharaoh has bestowed the Gold of Praise upon you. I have my own gift for you.’</p>

    <p>From under her robe she took a roll of papyrus secured with a coloured thread. ‘You knelt before me as a slave. Now rise to your feet as a free man.’ She held up the papyrus. ‘This is your deed of manumission, prepared by the scribes of the court. From this day forward, you are a free man.</p>

    <p>I lifted my head for the first time and stared at her in disbelief. She pressed the roll of papyrus into my numbed fingers, and smiled down at me fondly.</p>

    <p>‘You did not expect this, did you? You are so surprised that you have no words for me. Say something to me, Taita. Tell me how grateful you are for this boon.’</p>

    <p>Every word she spoke wounded me like a poisoned dart. My tongue was a rock in my mouth as I contemplated a life without her. As a freed man, I would be excluded from her presence for ever. I would never again prepare her food, nor attend her bath. I would never spread the covers over her as she prepared for sleep, nor would I rouse her in the dawn and be at her side when first she opened those lovely dark green eyes to each new day. I would never again sing with her, or hold her cup, or help her to dress and have the pleasure of gazing upon all her loveliness.</p>

    <p>I was stricken, and I stared at her hopelessly, as one whose life had reached its end.</p>

    <p>‘Be happy, Taita,’ she ordered me. ‘Be happy in this new freedom I give you.’</p>

    <p>‘I will never be happy again,’ I blurted. ‘You have cast me off. How can I ever be happy again?’</p>

    <p>Her smile faded away, and she stared at me in perturbation. ‘I offer you the most precious gift that it is in my power to give you. I offer you your freedom.’</p>

    <p>I shook my head. ‘You inflict the most dire punishment upon me. You are driving me away from you. I will never know happiness again.’</p>

    <p>‘It is not a punishment, Taita. It was meant as a reward. Please, don’t you understand?’</p>

    <p>‘The only reward I desire is to remain at your side for the rest of my life.’ I felt the tears welling up from deep inside me, and I tried to hold them back. ‘Please, mistress, I beg of you, don’t send me away from you. If you have any feeling towards me, allow me to stay with you.’</p>

    <p>‘Do not weep,’ she commanded. Tor if you do, then I will weep with you, in front of all my guests.’ I truly believe that she had not, until that moment, contemplated the consequences of this misplaced piece of generosity that she had dreamed up. The tears broke over my lids and streamed down my cheeks.</p>

    <p>‘Stop it! This is not what I wanted.’ Her own tears kept mine good company. ‘I only thought to honour you, as the king has honoured you.’</p>

    <p>I held up the roll of papyrus. ‘Please let me tear this piece of foolery to shreds. Take me back into your service. Give me leave to stand behind you, where I belong.’</p>

    <p>‘Stop it, Taita! You are breaking my heart.’ Loudly she snuffled up her tears, but I was merciless.</p>

    <p>‘The only gift I want from you is the right to serve you for all the days of my life. Please, mistress, rescind this deed. Give me your permission to tear it.’</p>

    <p>She nodded vigorously, blubbering as she used to do when she was a little girl who had fallen and grazed her knees. I ripped the sheet of papyrus once and then again. Not satisfied with this destruction, I held the fragments to the lamp flame and let them burn to crispy black curls.</p>

    <p>‘Promise me that you will never try to drive me away again. Swear that you will never again try to thrust my freedom upon me.’</p>

    <p>She nodded through her tears, but I would not accept that. ‘Say it,’ I insisted. ‘Say it aloud for all to hear.’</p>

    <p>‘I promise to keep you as my slave, never to sell you, nor to set you free,” she whispered huskily through the tears, and then a beam of mischief shone out of those tragic dark green eyes. ‘Unless, of course, you annoy me inordinately, then I will summon the law scribes immediately.’ She put out a hand to lift me to my feet. ‘Get up, you silly man, and attend to your duties. I swear my cup is empty.’</p>

    <p>I resumed my proper position behind her, and refilled the cup. The tipsy company thought it all a bit of fun that we had arranged for their amusement, and they clapped and whistled and threw flower petals at us to show their appreciation. I could see that most of them were relieved that we had not truly flouted decorum, and that a slave was still a slave.</p>

    <p>My mistress lifted the wine cup to her lips, but before she drank, she smiled at me over the rim. Though her eyes were still wet with tears, that smile lifted my spirits and restored my happiness. I felt as close to her then as ever I had in all the years.</p>

    <p class="Chap">THE MORNING AFTER THE BANQUET AND my hour of freedom, we woke to find that during the night the river had swollen with the commencement of the annual flood. We had no warning of it until the joyous cries of the watchmen down at the .??? port aroused us. Still heavy with wine, I left my bed and ran down to the riverside. Both banks were already lined with the populace of the city. They greeted the waters with prayers and songs and waving palm-fronds.</p>

    <p>The low waters had been the bright green of the verdigris that grows on bars of copper. The waters of the inundation had flushed it all away, and now the river had swollen to an ominous grey. During the night it had crept halfway up the stone pylons of the harbour, and soon it would press against the earthworks of the embankment. Then it would force its way into the mouths of the irrigation canals that had been cracked and dry for so many months. From there it would swirl out and flood the fields, drowning the huts of the peasants, and washing away the boundary markers between the fields.</p>

    <p>The surveying and replacement of the boundaries after each flood was the responsibility of the Guardian of the Waters. Lord Intef had multiplied his fortune by favouring the claims of the rich and the generous when the time came round each year to reset the marker stones.</p>

    <p>From upstream echoed the distant rumble of the cataract. The rising flood overwhelmed the natural barrages of granite that were placed in its path, and, as it roared through the gorges, the spray rose into the hard blue sky, a silver column that could be seen from every quarter of the nome of Assoun. When the fine mist drifted across the island, it was cool and refreshing on our upturned faces. We delighted in this blessing, for it was the only rain we ever knew in our valley. Even as we watched, the beaches around our island were eaten up by the flood. Soon our jetty would be submerged, and the river would lap at the gates of our garden. Where it would stop was a question that could only be calculated by a study of the levels of the Milometer. On those levels hung prosperity or famine for the whole land and every person in it.</p>

    <p>I hurried back to find my mistress and to prepare for the ceremony of the waters, in which I would play a prominent role. We dressed in our finest and I placed my new gold chain around my neck. Then, with the rest of our household and the ladies of the harem, we joined the spontaneous procession to the temple of Hapi.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh and all the great lords of Egypt led us. The priests, plump with rich living, were waiting for us on the temple steps. Their heads were shaven, their pates shining with oil, and their eyes glittering with avarice, for the king would sacrifice lavishly today.</p>

    <p>Before the king the statue of the god was carried from the sanctuary, and decked with flowers and fine crimson linen. Then the statue was drenched in oils and perfume while we sang psalms of praise and thanks to the god for sending down the flood.</p>

    <p>Far to the south, in a land that no civilized man had ever visited, the god Hapi sat on top of his mountain and from two pitchers of infinite capacity he poured the holy waters into his Nile. The water from each pitcher was of a different colour and taste; one was bright green and sweet, the other grey and heavy with the silt which flooded our fields each season and charged them with new life and fertility.</p>

    <p>While we sang, the king made sacrifice of corn and meats and wine and silver and gold. Then he called out his wise men, his engineers and his mathematicians, and bade them enter the Nilometer to begin their observations and their calculations.</p>

    <p>In the time that I had belonged to Lord Intef, I had been nominated as one of the keepers of the water. I was the only slave in that illustrious company, but I consoled myself by the fact that very few others wore the Gold of Praise, and that they treated me with respect. They had worked with me before, and they knew my worth. I had helped to design the Milometers that measured the flow of the river, and I had supervised the building of them. It was I who had worked out the complex formula to determine the projected height and the volume of each flood from the observations.</p>

    <p>Our way lit by flickering torches of pitch-dipped rushes, I followed the high priest into the mouth of the Nilometer, a dark opening in the rear wall of the sanctuary. We descended the incline shaft, the stone steps slippery with slime and the effusions of the river. From under our feet, one of the deadly black water cobras slithered away, and with a furious hiss plunged into the dark water that had already risen halfway up the shaft.</p>

    <p>We gathered on the last exposed step and by the light of the torches studied the marks that my masons had chiselled in the walls of the shaft. Each of the symbols had values, both magical and empirical, allotted to it.</p>

    <p>We made the first and most crucial reading together with extreme care. Over the following five days we would take it in turns to watch and record the rising waters, and time the readings with the flow, of a water-clock. From samples of the water, we would estimate the amount of silt it bore, and all these factors would influence our final conclusions. When the five days of observation were completed, we embarked on a further three days of calculations. These covered many scrolls of papyrus. Finally, we were ready to present our findings to the king. On that day Pharaoh returned to the temple in royal state, accompanied by his nobles and half the population of Elephantine to receive the estimates.</p>

    <p>As the high priest read them aloud, the king began to smile. We had forecast an inundation of almost perfect proportions. It would not be too low, to leave the fields exposed and baking in the sun, depriving them of the rich black layer of silt so vital to their fertility. Nor would it be so high as to wash away the canals and earthworks, and to drown the villages and cities along the banks. This season would bring forth bountiful harvests and fat herds.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh smiled, not so much for the good fortune of his subjects, but for the bounty that his tax-collectors would gather in. The annual taxes were computed on the value of the flood, and this year there would be vast new treasures added to the store-rooms of his funerary temple. To close the ceremony of the blessing of the water in the temple of Hapi, Pharaoh announced the date of the biennial pilgrimage to Thebes to participate in the festival of Osiris. It did not seem possible that two years had passed since my mistress had played the part of the goddess in the last passion of Osiris.</p>

    <p>I had as little sleep that night as when I had kept vigil in the shaft of the Nilometer, for my mistress was too excited to seek her own couch. She made me sit up with her until dawn, singing and laughing and repeating those stories of Tanus to which she never tired of listening.</p>

    <p>In eight days the royal flotilla would sail northwards on the rising flood of the Nile. When we arrived, Tanus, Lord Harrab would be waiting for us in Thebes. My mistress was delirious with happiness.</p>

    <p class="Chap">THE FLOTILLA THAT ASSEMBLED IN THE harbour roads of Elephantine was so numerous that it seemed to cover the water from bank to bank. My mistress remarked jokingly that a man might cross the Nile without wetting his feet by strolling over the bridge of hulls. With pennants and flags flying from every masthead, the fleet made a gallant show. We and the rest of the court had already embarked on the vessels that had been allotted to us, and from the deck we cheered the king as he descended the marble steps from the palace and went aboard the great, state barge. The moment he was safely embarked, a hundred horns sounded the signal to set sail. As one, the fleet squared away and pointed their bows into the north. With the rush of the river and the banks of oars driving us, we bore away.</p>

    <p>There had been a different spirit abroad in the’ land since Akh-Horus had destroyed the Shrikes. The inhabitants of every village we passed came down to the water’s edge to greet their king. Pharaoh sat high on the poop, wearing the cumbersome double crown, so that all might have a clear view of him. They waved palm-fronds and shouted, ‘May all the gods smile on Pharaoh!’ The river brought down to them not only their king, but also the promise of its own benevolence, and they were happy.</p>

    <p>Twice during the days that followed, Pharaoh and all his train went ashore to inspect the monuments that Akh-Horus had raised to his passing at the crossroads of the caravan routes. The local peasants had preserved these gruesome piles of skulls as sacred relics of the new god. They had polished each skull until it shone like ivory, and bound the pyramids with building clay so that they would stand through the years. Then they had built shrines over them and appointed priests to serve these holy places.</p>

    <p>At both these shrines my mistress left a gold ring as an offering, joyously accepted by the self-appointed guardians. It was to no avail that I protested this extravagance. My mistress often lacked the proper respect for the wealth that I was so painstakingly amassing on her behalf. Without my restraining hand, she would probably have given it all away to the grasping priesthood and the insatiable poor, smiling as she did so.</p>

    <p>On the tenth night after leaving Elephantine, the royal entourage camped on sTpleasant promontory above a bend in the river. The entertainment that evening was to include one of the most famous story-tellers in the land, and usually my mistress loved a good story above most other pleasures. Both she and I had been looking forward to this occasion and discussing it avidly since leaving the palace. It was therefore to my surprise and bitter disappointment that the Lady Lostris declared herself too fatigued and out of sorts to attend the story-teller. Although she urged me to go, and take the rest of our household with me, I could not leave her alone when she was unwell. I gave her a hot draught and I slept on the floor at the end of her bed, so that I could be near if she needed me during the night.</p>

    <p>I was truly worried in the morning when I tried to wake her. Usually she would spring from her bed with a smile of anticipation, ready to seize and devour the new day, a glutton for the joy of living. However, this morning she pulled the covers back over her head and mumbled, ‘Leave me to sleep a .little longer. I feel as heavy and dull as an old woman.’</p>

    <p>“The king has decreed an early start. We must be aboard before the sun rises. I will bring you a hot infusion that will cheer you.’ I poured boiling water over a bowl of herbs that I had picked with my own hands during the most propitious phase of the last moon.</p>

    <p>‘Do stop fussing,’ she grumped at me, but I would not let her sleep again. I prodded her awake and made her drink the tonic. She pulled a face. ‘I swear you are trying to poison me,’ she complained, and then, without warning and before I could do anything to prevent it, she vomited copiously.</p>

    <p>Afterwards she seemed as shocked as I was. We both stared at the steaming puddle beside her bed in consternation.</p>

    <p>‘What is wrong with me, Taita?’ she whispered. ‘Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.’</p>

    <p>Only then did the meaning of it all dawn on me.</p>

    <p>“The khamsin!’ I cried. “The cemetery of Tras! Tanus!’</p>

    <p>She stared at me blankly for a moment, and then her smile lit the gloom of the tent like a lamp. ‘I am making a baby!’ she cried.</p>

    <p>‘Not so loud, mistress,’ I pleaded.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus’ baby! I am carrying Tanus’ son.’ It could not be the king’s infant, for I had successfully kept him from her bed since her starvation sickness and her miscarriage.</p>

    <p>‘Oh, Taita,’ she purred, as she lifted her nightdress and inspected her flat, firm belly with awe. ‘Just think of it! A little imp just like Tanus growing inside of me.’ She palpated her stomach hopefully. ‘I knew that such delights as I discovered in the tomb of Tras could not pass unremarked by the gods. They have given me a memory that will last all my lifetime.’</p>

    <p>‘You race ahead,’ I warned her. ‘It may be only a colic. I must make the tests before we can be sure.’</p>

    <p>‘I need no test. I know it in my heart and in the secret depths of my body.’</p>

    <p>‘We will still do the tests,’ I told her wryly, and went to fetch the pot. She perched upon it to provide me with the first water of her day, and I divided this into two equal parts.</p>

    <p>The first portion of her urine I mixed with an equal part of Nile water. Then I filled two jars with black earth and in each of them planted five seeds of dhurra corn. I watered one jar with pure Nile water, and the other with the mixture that my mistress had provided. This was the first test.</p>

    <p>Then I hunted amongst the reeds in the lagoon near the camp and captured ten frogs. These were not the lively green and yellow variety with leaping back legs, but slimy, black creatures. Their heads are not separated from their sluggish, fat bodies by a neck, and their eyes sit on top of the flat skull, so that the children call them sky-gazers.</p>

    <p>I placed five of each of the sky-gazers in two separate jars of river water. To the one I added my mistress’s intimate emission and I left the other unadulterated. The following morning, in the privacy of my mistress’s cabin on board the galley, we removed the cloth with which I had covered the jars and inspected the contents.</p>

    <p>The com watered by the Lady Lostris had thrown tiny green shoots, while the other seeds were still inert. The five sky-gazers who had not received my mistress’s blessing were barren, but the other more fortunate five had each laid long silvery strings which were speckled with black eggs.</p>

    <p>‘I told you so!’ my mistress chirruped smugly, before I could give my official diagnosis. ‘Oh, thanks to all the gods! No more beautiful thing has happened to me in all my life.’</p>

    <p>‘I will speak to Aton immediately. You will share the king’s couch this very night,’ I told her grimly, and she stared at me in bewilderment.</p>

    <p>‘Even Pharaoh who believes most things I tell him, will not believe that you were impregnated by the seeds blown in on the khamsin wind. We must have a foster-father for this little bastard of ours.’ Already I considered the infant ours, and not hers alone. Though I tried to conceal it behind my levity, I was every bit as delighted with her fecundity as she was.</p>

    <p>‘Don’t you ever call him a bastard again,’ she flared at me. ‘He will be a prince.’</p>

    <p>‘He will be a prince only if I can find a royal sire for him. Prepare yourself. I am going to see the king.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">‘LAST NIGHT I HAD A DREAM, GREAT Egypt,’ I told Pharaoh. ‘It was so amazing that to confirm it I worked the Mazes of Ammon-Ra.’</p>

    <p>Pharaoh leaned forward eagerly, for he had come to believe in my dreams and the Mazes as much as any of my other patients. ‘This time it is unequivocal, Majesty. In my dream the goddess Isis appeared and promised to counter the baleful influence of her brother Seth, who so cruelly deprived you of your first son when he struck down the Lady Lostris with the wasting disease. Take my mistress to your bed on the first day of the festival of Osiris, and you will be blessed with another son. That is the promise of the goddess.’</p>

    <p>‘Tonight is the eve of the festival.’ The king looked delighted. ‘In truth, Taita, I have been ready to perform this pleasant duty all these past months, had you only allowed me to do so. But you have not told me what you saw in the Mazes of Ammon-Ra.’ Again he leaned forward eagerly, and I was ready for him.</p>

    <p>‘It was the vision as before, only this time it was stronger and more vivid. The same endless forest of trees growing along the banks of the river, each tree crowned and imperial. Your dynasty reaching into the ages, strong and unbroken.’</p>

    <p>Pharaoh sighed with satisfaction. ‘Send the child to me.’ When I returned to the tent, my mistress was waiting for me. She had prepared herself with good grace and humour.</p>

    <p>‘I shall close my eyes and imagine that I am back in the tomb of Tras with Tanus,’ she confided, and then giggled saucily. ‘Although to imagine the king as Tanus is to imagine that the tail of the mouse has become the trunk of the elephant.’</p>

    <p>Aton came to fetch her to the king’s tent soon after the king had eaten his dinner. She went with a calm expression and a firm step, dreaming perhaps of her little prince, and of his true father who waited for us in Thebes.</p>

    <p class="Chap">BELOVED THEBES, BEAUTIFUL THEBES OF the hundred gates?how we rejoiced as we saw it appear ahead of us, decorating the broad sweep of the river-bank with its temples and gleaming walls.</p>

    <p>My mistress sang out with excitement as each of the familiar landmarks revealed itself to us. Then, as the royal barge put in to the wharf below the palace of the grand vizier, the joy of home-coming went out of both of us, and we fell silent. The Lady Lostris groped for my hand like a little girl frightened by tales of hob-goblins, for we had seen her father.</p>

    <p>Lord Intef with his sons, Menset and Sobek, those two thumbless heroes, stood at the head of the great concourse of the nobles and the city fathers of Thebes that waited upon the quay to greet the king. Lord Intef was as handsome and suave as I had imagined him in my nightmares, and I felt my spirits quail.</p>

    <p>‘You must be vigilant now,’ the Lady Lostris whispered to me. “They will seek to have you out of their way. Remember the cobra.’</p>

    <p>Not far behind the grand vizier stood Rasfer. During our absence he had obviously received high promotion. He now wore the head-dress of a Commander of Ten Thousand and carried the golden whip of rank. There had been no improvement in his facial muscles. One side of his face still sagged hideously and saliva dribbled from the corner of his mouth. At that moment he recognized me, and grinned at me with half his face across the narrow strip of water. He lifted his golden whip in ironic greeting.</p>

    <p>‘I promise you, my lady, that my hand will be upon my dagger and I will eat nothing but fruit that I have peeled with my own hands while Rasfer and I are in Thebes together,’ I murmured, as I smiled at him and returned his salute with a cheery wave.</p>

    <p>‘You are to accept no strange gifts,’ my mistress insisted, ‘and you will sleep at the foot of my bed, where I can protect you at night. During the day you will stay at my side, and not go wandering off on your own.’</p>

    <p>‘I will not find that irksome,’ I assured her, and over the following days I kept my promise to her and remained under her immediate protection, for I was certain that Lord Intef would not jeopardize his connection to the throne by putting his daughter in danger.</p>

    <p>Naturally, we were often in the company of the grand vizier, for it was his duty to escort the king through all the ceremonies of the festival. During this time, Lord Intef played the role of loving and considerate father to the Lady Lostris, and he treated her with all the deference and consideration due to a royal wife. Each morning he sent her gifts, gold and jewels and exquisite little carvings of scarabs and godlets in ivory and precious woods. Despite my mistress’s orders, I did not return these. I did not wish to warn the enemy, and besides, the gifts were valuable. I sold them discreetly and invested the proceeds in stores of corn held for us in the granaries of trustworthy merchants in the city, men who were my friends.</p>

    <p>In view of the expected harvest, the price of com was the lowest it had been for ten years. There was only one direction it could go, and that was up, although we might have to wait a while for our profits. The merchants gave me receipts in the name of my mistress which I deposited in the archives of the law courts. I kept only a fifth part to myself, which I felt was a very moderate commission.</p>

    <p>This gave me some secret pleasure whenever I caught Lord Intef watching me with those pale leopard’s eyes. That look left me in no doubt that his feelings towards me had not moderated. I remembered his patience and his persistence when dealing with an enemy. He waited at the centre of his web like a beautiful spider, and his eyes glittered as he watched me. I remembered the bowl of poisoned milk and the cobra, and despite all my precautions, I was uneasy.</p>
  </div>

  <a id="section_7"></a>

  

  <div>
    <p>Meanwhile the festival rolled on with all the ceremony and tradition, as it had for centuries past. However, this season it was not Tanus’ Blues but another squadron that hunted the river-cows in the lagoon of Hapi, while another company of actors played out the passion in the temple of Osiris. Because Pharaoh’s decree was observed and the version of the play was mine, the words were as powerful and moving. However, this new Isis was not as lovely as my mistress had portrayed her, nor was Horus as noble or striking as Lord Tanus. On the other hand, Seth was winsome and lovable in comparison to the way that Rasfer had played him.</p>

    <p>The day after the passion, Pharaoh crossed the river to inspect his temple, and on this occasion he kept me close at hand throughout the day. On numerous occasions he openly consulted me on aspects of the works. Of course I wore my golden chain whenever it was proper to do so. None of this was missed by Lord Intef, and I could see him musing on the favour the king showed to me. I hoped that this might further serve to protect me from the grand vizier’s vengeance.</p>

    <p>Since I had left Thebes, another architect had been placed in charge of the temple project. It was perhaps unfair that Pharaoh should expect this unfortunate to be able to maintain the high standards that I had set, or to push the work forward at the same pace.</p>

    <p>‘By the blessed mother of Horus, I wish you were still in charge here, Taita,’ Pharaoh muttered. ‘If she would part with you, I would buy you from your mistress, and keep you here in the City of .the Dead permanently to supervise the work. The cost seems to have doubled since this other idiot took over from you.’</p>

    <p>‘He is a naive young man,’ I agreed. ‘The masons and the contractors will steal his testicles from him and he will not notice that they are missing.’</p>

    <p>‘It is my balls mat they are stealing,’ the king scowled. ‘I want you to go over the bill of quantities with him and show him where we are being robbed.’</p>

    <p>I was of course flattered by his regard, and there was nothing spiteful in my pointing out to Pharaoh the lapses of taste that the new architect had perpetrated when he redesigned the pediment to my temple facade, or the shoddy craftsmanship that those rogues in the guild of masons had been able to slip past him. The pediment was permeated with the decadent Syrian style that was all the rage in the Lower Kingdom, where the common tastes of the low-bom red pretender were corrupting the classical traditions of Egyptian art.</p>

    <p>As for the workmanship, I demonstrated to the king how it was possible to slip a fragment of papyrus between the joints of the stone blocks that made up the side-wall of the mortuary temple. Pharaoh ordered both the pediment and the temple wall to be torn down, and he fined the guild of masons five hundred deben of gold to be paid into the royal store-rooms.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh spent the rest of that day and the whole of the next reviewing the treasures in the store-rooms of the funerary temple. Here at least he could find very little to complain of. In the history of the world never had such wealth been assembled in one place at one time. Even I, who love fine things, was soon jaded by the abundance of it, and my eyes were pained by the dazzle of gold.</p>

    <p>The king insisted that the Lady Lostris remain at his side all this time. I think that his infatuation with her was slowly turning into real love, or as close a facsimile of it as he was capable of. The consequence of his affection for her was that when we returned across the river to Thebes, my mistress was exhausted, and I feared for the child she was carrying. It was too soon to tell the king of her condition and to suggest that he showed her more consideration. It was less than a week since she had returned to his couch, and such an early diagnosis of pregnancy even from me must arouse his suspicion. To him she was still a healthy and robust young woman, and he treated her that way.</p>

    <p class="Chap">THE FESTIVAL ENDED, AS IT HAD FOR CENTURIES past, with the assembly of the people in the temple of Osiris to hear the proclamation from the throne.</p>

    <p>On the raised stone dais in front of the sanctuary of Osiris, Pharaoh was seated on his tall throne so that all the congregation could have a clear view of him. He wore the double crown and carried the crook and the flail. This time there was an alteration to the usual layout of the temple, for I had made a suggestion to the king which he had been gracious enough to adopt. Against three walls of the inner temple he had ordered the erection of timber scaffolding. These rose in tiers halfway up the massive stone walls, and provided seating for thousands of the notables of Thebes from which they had a. privileged and uninterrupted view of the proceedings. I had suggested that these stands be decorated with coloured bunting and palm-fronds, to disguise their ugliness. It was the first time that these structures were built in our land. Thereafter, they were to become commonplace, and they were built at most public functions, along the routes of royal processions and around the fields of athletic games. To this day they are known as Taita stands.</p>

    <p>There had been much bitter competition for seats upon these stands, but as their designer, I had been able to procure the very best for my mistress and myself. We were directly opposite the throne and a little above the height of the king’s head, so we had a fine view of the whole of the inner courtyard. I had provided a leather cushion stuffed with lamb’s-wool for the Lady Lostris and a basket of fruits and cakes, together with jars of sherbet and beer, to sustain us during the interminable ceremony.</p>

    <p>All around us were assembled the noblest in the land, lords and ladies decked-oat in high fashion. The generals and admirals carrying their.golden whips and proudly flaunting the honours and standards of their regiments, the guild masters and the rich merchants, the priests and the ambassadors from the vassal states of the empire, they were all here.</p>

    <p>In front of the king extended the courts of the temple, one opening into another like the boxes in a children’s puzzle-game, but such was the layout of the massive stone walls that the gates were all perfectly aligned. A worshipper standing in the Avenue of Sacred Rams outside the pylons of the main gate could look through the inner gates and clearly see the king on his high throne almost four hundred paces away.</p>

    <p>All the courts of the temple were packed with the multitudes of the common people, and the overflow spilled out into the sacred avenue and the gardens beyond the temple walls. Though I had lived almost my entire life in Thebes, I had never seen such a gathering. It was not possible to count their numbers, but I estimated that there must have been two hundred thousand assembled that day. From them rose such’ a hubbub of sound that I felt myself but a single bee in the vast humming hive.</p>

    <p>Around the throne was gathered a small group of the highest dignitaries, their heads at the level of Pharaoh’s feet. Of course one of these was the high priest of Osiris. During the past year the old abbot had left this transitory world of ours and set off on his journey through the underworld to the western fields of the eternal paradise. This new abbot was a younger, firmer man. I knew that he would not be so easily manipulated by Lord Intef. In fact, he had collaborated with me in certain unusual arrangements for today’s ceremony that I had put in hand while supervising the erection of the Taita stands.</p>

    <p>However, the most impressive figure in the group, rivalling Pharaoh himself, was the grand vizier. Lord Intef drew all eyes. He was tall and stately in bearing, handsome as a legend. With the heavy chains of the Gold of Praise lying weightily upon his chest and shoulders, he was like a figure from the myth of the pantheon. Close behind him loomed the hideous shape of Rasfer.</p>

    <p>Lord Intef opened the ceremony in the traditional manner by stepping into the clear space before the throne and beginning the address of welcome to the king from the twin cities of Thebes. As he spoke, I glanced sideways at my mistress, and even though I shared her loathing, I was shocked by the expression of anger and hatred that she made no attempt to conceal, and that she directed openly at her own father. I wanted to warn her to make it less obvious to all about her, but I knew that in doing so, I might merely draw further attention to her burning antagonism.</p>

    <p>The grand vizier spoke at length, listing his own accomplishments and the loyal service he had rendered Pharaoh in the year past. The crowd murmured and rustled with boredom and discomfort. The heat was rising from so many bodies, and the rays of the sun beating down into the crowded courts were trapped within the temple walls. I saw more than one woman in the press swoon and collapse.</p>

    <p>When at last Lord Intef finished speaking, the high priest stepped into his place. While the sun made its noon overhead, he reported to the king on the ecclesiastical affairs of Thebes. As he spoke, the heat and the stench increased; perfume and fragrant oils could no longer disguise the odour of hot, unwashed bodies and running sweat. There was no escape from the crowd to attend urgent bodily functions. Men and women simply squatted where they stood. The temple began to stink like a sty or a public latrine, I handed my mistress a silk kerchief drenched in perfume which she dabbed to her nose.</p>

    <p>There was a sigh of relief when at last the high priest ended his address with a blessing on the king in the name of the god Osiris, and, with a deep bow, retreated to his place behind the grand vizier. For the first time since it had begun to assemble before dawn that morning, the crowd fell completely silent. The boredom and discomfort was forgotten, and they craned forward eagerly to hear Pharaoh speak.</p>

    <p>The king rose to his feet. I wondered at the old man’s fortitude, for he had sat all this time like a statue. He spread his arms in benediction, and at that moment the hallowed chalice of custom and tradition was shattered by an event that plunged the entire congregation?priests, nobles and commoners?into consternation. I was one of the few in the crowd who was not surprised by what followed, for I had done more than my share to arrange it all.</p>

    <p>The great burnished capper doors to the sanctuary swung open. There seemed to be no human agency to the movement, it was as though the doors opened of their own accord.</p>

    <p>A gasp, a sigh of expelled breath passed like a wind through temple courts, and rustled the densely packed ranks as though they were the leaves of a tamarind tree. Then suddenly a woman screamed, and immediately a groan of superstitious horror shook them all. Some fell to their knees, some lifted their hands above their heads in terror, others covered their faces with their shawls so that they should not be struck blind by looking on sights that were not for mortal eyes.</p>

    <p>A god strode out through the sanctuary doors, a tall and terrifying god, whose cloak swirled about his shoulders as he moved. His helmet was crowned with a plume of egret’s feathers, and his features were grotesque and metallic, half-eagle and half-man, with a hooked beak and dark slits for eyes.</p>

    <p>‘ Akh-Horus!’ screamed a woman, and she collapsed in a dead faint upon the stone flags.</p>

    <p>‘Akh-Horus!’ the cry was taken up. ‘It is the god!’ Row after row, they fell upon their knees in the attitude of reverence. Those on the high tiers of stands knelt and many of them made the sign to avert misfortune. Even the group of nobles around the throne went down. In all the temple only two persons remained on their feet. Pharaoh posed on the steps of his throne like a painted statue; and the grand vizier of Thebes stood tall and arrogant.</p>

    <p>Akh-Horus stopped in front of the king and looked up at him through those slitted eyes in the bronze mask, and even then Pharaoh never flinched. The king’s cheeks were painted dead white, so I could not tell whether he blanched, but there was a glitter in his eyes that may have been either religious ecstasy, or terror.</p>

    <p>‘Who are you?’ Pharaoh challenged. ‘Are you ghost or man? Why do you disturb our solemn proceedings?’ His voice was strong and clear. I could detect no tremor in it, and my admiration for him was enhanced. Weak and aging and gullible perhaps, but still the old man had his full share of courage. He could face up to man or god and stand his ground like a warrior.</p>

    <p>Akh-Horus answered him in a voice that had commanded regiments in the desperate din of battle, a voice that echoed amongst the stone pillars. ‘Great Pharaoh, I am a man, not a ghost. I am your man. I come before you in response to your command. I come before you to account to you for the duty that you laid upon me in this place on this very day of Osiris two years ago.’</p>

    <p>He lifted the helmet from his head, and the fiery curls tumbled down. The congregation recognized him instantly. A shout went up that seemed to rock the foundations of the temple.</p>

    <p>‘Lord Tanus! Tanus! Tanus!’</p>

    <p>It seemed to me that my mistress screamed the loudest of them all, fairly deafening me, who sat so close beside her.</p>

    <p>‘Tanus! Akh-Horus! Akh-Horus!’ The two names mingled and crashed against the temple walls like storm-driven surf.</p>

    <p>‘He has risen from his tomb! He has become a god amongst us!’</p>

    <p>It did not abate until suddenly Tanus drew the sword from his scabbard and held it aloft in an unmistakable command for silence. This was obeyed, and in the silence he spoke again.</p>

    <p>‘Great Egypt, do I have your permission to speak?’</p>

    <p>I think by now the king could no longer rely on his powers of speech, for he made a gesture with crook and flail, and then his legs seemed to give way beneath him and he dropped back on his throne.</p>

    <p>Tanus addressed him in ringing tones that carried to the outer court. ‘Two years ago you charged me with the destruction of those viperous nests of murderers and robbers who were threatening the life of the state. You placed in my trust the royal hawk seal.’</p>

    <p>From under his cloak, Tanus drew out the blue statuette and placed it on the steps of the throne. Then he stepped back and spoke again.</p>

    <p>‘In order better to carry out the king’s orders, I pretended my own death and caused the mummy of a stranger to be sealed in my tomb.’</p>

    <p>‘Bak-Her!’ shouted a single voice, and they took up the cry until Tanus once more commanded silence.</p>

    <p>‘I led a thousand brave men of the Blues into the deserts and the wild places and sought out the Shrikes in their secret fortresses. There we slew them in their hundreds and piled their severed heads at the roadside.’</p>

    <p>‘Bak-Her!’ they screamed. ‘It is true. Akh-Horus has done all these things.’ Once again Tanus silenced them.</p>

    <p>‘I broke the power of the barons. I slaughtered their followers without mercy. In all this very Egypt of ours there remains only one who still calls himself a Shrike.’</p>

    <p>Now at last they were silent, gobbling up every word he said, fascinated and intent. Even Pharaoh could not hold his impatience in check. ‘Speak, Lord Tanus, whom men now know as Akh-Horus. Name this man. Give me his name so that he may come to know the wrath of Pharaoh.’</p>

    <p>‘He hides behind the name of Akh-Seth,’ Tanus roared. ‘His deeds of infamy rank with those of his brother, the dark</p>

    <p>-’Give me his true name,’ Pharaoh commanded, rising once more to his feet in his agitation. ‘Name this last of all the Shrikes!’</p>

    <p>Tanus drew out the moment. He looked around the temple slowly and deliberately. When our eyes met, I nodded so slightly that only he saw the movement, but his gaze passed on without a pause and he looked towards the open doors of the sanctuary.</p>

    <p>The attention of all the congregation was so fixed upon Lord Tanus that they did not at first see the file of armed men that issued swiftly and silently from the sanctuary. Although they wore full armour and carried their war shields, I recognized most of them under the helmets. There were Remrem and Astes and fifty other warriors of the Blues. Swiftly, they formed up around the throne like a royal bodyguard, but, without making it obvious, Remrem and Astes moved up behind Lord Intef. As soon as they were in position, Tanus spoke again.</p>

    <p>‘I will name this Akh-Seth for you, Divine Pharaoh. He stands unashamedly in the shadow of your throne.’ Tanus pointed with his sword. “There he is, wearing the Gold of Praise about his traitor’s throat. There he stands, Pharaoh’s sole companion who has turned your kingdom into a playground for murderers and bandits. That is Akh-Seth, governor of the nome of Thebes, grand vizier of the Upper Kingdom.’</p>

    <p>An awful hush fell upon the temple. There must have been ten thousand or more in the congregation who had suffered grievously at Lord Intef’s hands and who had every reason to hate him, but not a voice spoke out in jubilation or in triumph against him. All knew just how terrible was his wrath, and just how certain his retribution. I could smell the stink of their fear in the air, thick as the incense smoke. Every one of them understood that even Tanus’ reputation and his mighty deeds were not sufficient for his unproven accusation to prevail against such a person as Lord Intef. To show joy or open agreement at this stage would be mortal folly.</p>

    <p>In that hush Lord Intef laughed. It was a sound full of disdain, and with a dismissive gesture he turned his back upon Tanus and spoke directly to the king. ‘The desert sun has burned his brain. The poor lad has gone mad. There is not a single word of truth in all his ravings. I should be angry, but instead I am saddened that a warrior of reputation has fallen so low.’ He held out both hands to Pharaoh, a dignified and loyal gesture. ‘All my life I have served Pharaoh and my people. My honour is so invulnerable that I see no need to defend myself against these wild rantings. Without fear I place my trust in the wisdom and justice of the divine king. I let my deeds and my love of Pharaoh speak, in place of my tongue.’</p>

    <p>I saw the confusion and indecision on the king’s painted face. His lips trembled and his brow was furrowed, for he was not blessed with a swift and incisive mind. After a moment he opened his mouth to speak, but before he could utter any fateful or irredeemable judgement, Tanus lifted his sword again and pointed beyond the throne to the open doors of the sanctuary.</p>

    <p>Through the doors came another procession of men so unusual that Pharaoh gaped at them with his mouth still open. Kratas led, with his visor raised and a sword in his right hand. Those who followed him wore only loin-cloths, and their heads and feet were bare. Their arms were bound behind their backs, and they shuffled like slaves on their way to the auction block.</p>

    <p>I was watching Lord Intef s face, and I saw the shock assail him and force him to flinch, as though he had received a blow in the face. He had recognized the captives, but he had obviously believed that they were long dead, and their skulls grinning at the roadside. He darted a sideways glance at the small sacristy door in the wall that was almost hidden by the hanging linen bunting. It was his only escape from the crowded inner court, but Remrem moved one pace to his right and blocked his path to the doorway. Lord Intef looked back at the throne and lifted his chin in a confident and defiant gesture.</p>

    <p>The six bound captives lined up before the throne and then, at a quiet order from Kratas, dropped to their knees and bowed their heads.</p>

    <p>‘Who are these creatures?’ Pharaoh demanded, and Tanus stood over the first of them, seized his bound wrists and hauled him to his feet. The captive’s skin was studded with the old healed scars of the smallpox and his blind eye reflected the light like a silver coin.</p>

    <p>“The divine Pharaoh asks who you are,’ Tanus said softly. ‘Reply to the question.’</p>

    <p>‘Great Egypt, I am Shufti,’ he said. ‘I was once a baron of the Shrikes before Akh-Horus scattered and slew my clan at the city of Gallala.’</p>

    <p>‘Tell the king who was your overlord,’ Tanus insisted.</p>

    <p>‘Akh-Seth was my overlord,’ Shufti replied. ‘I swore a blood-oath of allegiance to Akh-Seth, and I paid a bounty of one-quarter of all my plunder to him. In return Akh-Seth gave me immunity from the forces of law, and provided me with information on my intended victims.’</p>

    <p>‘Point out to the king the man you know as Akh-Seth,’ Tanus ordered, and Shufti shuffled forward until he faced Lord Intef. He filled his mouth with spittle and spat it on to the grand vizier’s gorgeous uniform. “This is Akh-Seth,’ he cried. ‘And may the worms feast on his guts!’</p>

    <p>Kratas dragged Shufti to one side and Tanus lifted the next captive to his feet. ‘Tell the king who you are,’ he ordered.</p>

    <p>‘I am Akheku, and I was a baron of the Shrikes, but all my men are killed.’</p>

    <p>‘Who was your overlord? To whom did you pay your bounty?’ Tanus demanded.</p>

    <p>‘Lord Intef was my overlord. I paid my bounty into the coffers of the grand vizier.’</p>

    <p>Lord Intef stood proud and aloof, showing no emotion as these accusation were hurled at him. He offered no defence as, one after the other, the barons were dragged before him and each made the same declaration.</p>

    <p>‘Lord Intef was my overlord. Lord Intef is Akh-Seth.’ The silence of the multitudes in the temple was as oppressive as the heat. They watched in horror, or in silent hatred, or in confusion and disbelief. However, not one of them dared yet to speak out against Lord Intef, or to show emotion until Pharaoh had first spoken.</p>

    <p>The last of the barons was brought forward to confront the grand vizier. He was a tall, lean man with stringy muscles and sun-blasted skin. There was Bedouin blood in his veins, for his eyes were black and his nose beaked. His beard was thick and curling, and his expression arrogant. ‘My name is Basti.’ He spoke more clearly than any of the others. ‘Men call me Basti the Cruel, though I know not the reason why.’ He grinned with a raffish hangman’s humour. ‘I was a baron of the Shrikes until Akh-Horus destroyed my clan. Lord Intef was my overlord.’</p>

    <p>This time he was not dragged away as the others had been. Tanus spoke to him again. ‘Tell the king. Did you know Pianki, Lord Harrab, who in former times was a nobleman of Thebes?’</p>

    <p>‘I knew him well. I had dealings with him.’</p>

    <p>‘What were these dealings?’ Tanus asked, with death in his voice.</p>

    <p>‘I plundered his caravans. I burned his crops in the fields. I raided his mines at Sestra, and I slew the miners in such amusing fashion that no others ever came to work the copper there. I burned his villas. I sent my men into the cities to speak evil of him, so that his honesty and his loyalty to the state were tarnished. I helped others to destroy him so that in the end he drank the poisonous Datura seed from his own cup.’</p>

    <p>I saw the hand of Pharaoh that held the royal flail shake as he listened, and one of his eyelids twitched in a manner that I had noticed before-when he was sore distressed.</p>

    <p>‘Who was it that ordered these things?’</p>

    <p>‘Lord Intef commanded these things and rewarded me with a takh of pure gold.’</p>

    <p>‘What did Lord Intef hope to gain from this persecution of Lord Harrab?’</p>

    <p>Basti grinned and shrugged. ‘Lord Intef is grand vizier, while Pianki, Lord Harrab is dead. It seems to me Lord Intef achieved his purpose.’</p>

    <p>‘You acknowledge that I have offered you no clemency in return for this confession? Do you understand that death awaits you?’</p>

    <p>‘Death?’ Basti laughed. ‘I have never been afraid of that. It is the flour of the loaf I bake. I have fed it to countless others, so now why should I be afraid to feast on it myself?’ Was he fool or brave man, I wondered, as I listened to the boast. Either way, I could find neither pity nor admiration for him in my heart. I remembered that Pianki, Lord Harrab had been a man like his son, and that is where my pity and my admiration lay.</p>

    <p>I saw the merciless expression in the eyes of Tanus. I knew that he shared my feelings, and his grip upon the hilt of his sword tightened until his fingers turned as white as those of a drowned man.</p>

    <p>‘Take him away!’ he grated. ‘Let him await the king’s pleasure.’ I saw him compose himself with an effort, then he turned back to face the king. He went down on one knee before him.</p>

    <p>‘I have done all that you asked of me, Divine Mamose, god and ruler of Kemit. I wait for you to command me further.’ His dignity and his grace closed up my throat so that I could not swallow. It took an effort to compose myself.</p>

    <p>The silence in the temple persisted. I could hear my mistress’s laboured breathing beside me and then I felt her take my hand and squeeze it with a strength that threatened to crack my finger-bones.</p>

    <p>At last Pharaoh spoke, but with dismay I heard the doubt in his voice, and I sensed intuitively that he did not want any of this to be true. He had trusted Lord Intef so deeply for so long that it shook the foundations of his faith.</p>

    <p>‘Lord Intef, you have heard the accusations against you. How say you to them?’</p>

    <p>‘Divine Pharaoh, are these indeed accusations? I thought them merely the fantasies of a young man driven insane with envy and jealousy. He is the son of a convicted criminal and a traitor. Lord Tanus’ motives are plain to see. He has convinced himself that the traitor Pianki might have become grand vizier in my place. In some perverse fashion, he holds me responsible for his father’s downfall.’</p>

    <p>With a wave of his hand he dismissed Tanus. It was so skilfully done that I saw the king waver. His doubts were growing stronger. For a lifetime he had implicitly trusted Lord Intef, and it was difficult for him to adjust his thinking. He wanted to believe in his innocence.</p>

    <p>‘What of the accusations of the barons?’ Pharaoh asked at last. ‘What reply do you make to them?’</p>

    <p>‘Barons?’ Lord Intef asked. ‘Must we flatter them with such a title? By their own testimony they are criminals of the basest kind?murderers, thieves, violators of women and children. Should we look for truth in them any more than we should look for honour and conscience in the beasts of the field?’ Lord Intef pointed to them, and they were indeed half-naked and bound like animals. ‘Let us gaze upon them, Divine Majesty. Are these not the kind of men that can be bribed or beaten into saying anything for the sake of then-own skins? Would you take the word of one of these against a man who has served you faithfully all his life?’</p>

    <p>I saw the small, involuntary nod of the king’s head as he accepted the reasoning of the man he had looked upon as a friend, the man upon whom he had heaped trust and rewards.</p>

    <p>‘All you say is true. You have always served me without vice. These rogues are strangers to truth and honour. It is possible that they may have been coerced.’ He vacillated, and Lord Intef sensed his advantage.</p>

    <p>‘So far I have had only words thrown at me. Surely there must be some other evidence to support such mortal charges against me? Is there one person in this very Egypt who will bring evidence against me, real evidence and not mere words? If there is, let him come forward. Then I will answer this charge. If there is no one who has this evidence, then I have nothing to answer to&gt;’</p>

    <p>His words troubled Pharaoh deeply, I could see that. He gazed about the hall as if seeking the evidence that Lord Intef demanded, and then he obviously reached a decision.</p>

    <p>‘Lord Tanus, what proof do you have of these things, apart from the words of murderers and criminals?’</p>

    <p>‘The beast has covered his tracks well,’ Tanus admitted, ‘and he has taken cover in the densest thicket where it is difficult to come at him. I have no further evidence against Lord Intef, but there may be some other who does, somebody who will be inspired by what he has heard here today. I beg you, Royal Egypt, ask your people if there is not one of them who can bring forth anything to help us here.’</p>

    <p>‘Pharaoh, this is provocation. My enemies will be emboldened to come out of the shadows where they lurk to attack me,’ cried Lord Intef in vehement protest, but Pharaoh silenced him with a brusque gesture. ‘They will bear false witness against you at their peril,’ he promised, and then addressed the congregation.</p>

    <p>‘My people! Citizens of Thebes! You have heard the accusations made against my trusted and well-beloved grand vizier. Is there one of you who can provide the proof that Lord Tanus lacks? Can any of you bring forward evidence against the Lord Intef? If so, I charge you to speak.’</p>

    <p>I was standing before I realized what I had done, and my voice was so loud in my own ears that it startled me.</p>

    <p>‘I am Taita, who was once the slave of Lord Intef,’ I shouted, and Pharaoh looked across at me and frowned. ‘I have aught that I wish to show Your Majesty.’</p>

    <p>‘You are known to us, Taita the physician. You may approach.’</p>

    <p>As I left my seat on the stand and went down to stand before the king, I looked across at Lord Intef and I missed my step. It was as though I had walked into a stone wall, so tangible was his hatred.</p>

    <p>‘Divine Egypt, this thing is a slave.’ Lord Intef’s voice was cold and tight. “The word of a slave against a lord of the Theban circle, and a high officer of the state?what mockery is this?’</p>

    <p>I was still so conditioned to respond to his voice and to succumb to his word, that my resolve wavered. Then I felt Tanus’ hand on my arm. It was only a brief touch, but it manned and sustained me. However, Lord Intef had noticed the gesture, and he pointed it out to the king.</p>

    <p>‘See how this slave is in the thrall of my accuser. Here is another one of Lord Tanus’ trained monkeys.’ Lord In-tef’s voice was once more smooth as warm honey. ‘His insolence is unbounded. There are penalties laid down in the law codes?’</p>

    <p>Pharaoh silenced him with a gesture of his flail. ‘You presume on our good opinion of you, Lord Intef. The codes of law are mine to interpret or amend. In them there are penalties laid down for the high-born as well as the common man. You would be well advised to remember that.’</p>

    <p>Lord Intef bowed in submission and remained silent, but suddenly his face was haggard and drawn as he realized his predicament.</p>

    <p>Now the king looked down at me. ‘These are unusual circumstances, such as allow of unprecedented remedy. However, Taita the slave, let me warn you that if your words should prove frivolous, should they lack proof or substance, the strangling-rope awaits you.’</p>

    <p>That threat and the poisonous bane of Lord Intef s gaze upon me made me stutter. ‘While I was the slave of the grand vizier, I was his messenger and his emissary to the barons. I know all these men.’ I pointed to the captives that Kratas held near to the throne. ‘It was I who carried Lord Intef’s commands to them.’</p>

    <p>‘Lies! More words, lacking proof,’ Lord Intef called out, but now the edge of desperation was in his voice. ‘Where is the proof?’</p>

    <p>‘Silence!’ the king thundered with sudden ferocity. ‘We will hear the testimony of Taita the slave.’ He was looking directly at me, and I drew breath to continue.</p>

    <p>‘It was I who carried the command of Lord Intef to Basti the Cruel. The command was to destroy the estate and the fortune of Pianki, Lord Harrab. At that time I was the confidant of Intef, I knew that he desired the position of grand vizier to himself. All these things that Lord Intef commanded were accomplished. Lord Harrab was destroyed, and he was deprived of Pharaoh’s favour and love, so that he drank the Datura cup. I, Taita, attest all these things.’</p>

    <p>‘It is so.’ Basti the Cruel lifted his bound arms to the throne. ‘All that Taita says is the truth.’</p>

    <p>‘Bah-Her!’ shouted the barons. ‘It is the truth. Taita speaks the truth.’</p>

    <p>‘Still these are only words,’ the king mused. ‘Lord Intef has demanded proof. I, your Pharaoh, demand proof.’</p>

    <p>‘For half my lifetime I was the scribe and the treasurer of the grand vizier. I kept the record of his fortune. I noted his profits and his expenses on my scrolls. I gathered in the bounty that the barons of the Shrikes paid to Lord Intef, and I disposed of all this wealth.’</p>

    <p>‘Can you show me these scrolls, Taita?’ Pharaoh’s expression shone like the full moon at the mention of treasure. Now I had his avid attention.</p>

    <p>‘No, Majesty, I cannot do so. The scrolls remained always in the possession of Lord Intef.’</p>

    <p>Pharaoh made no effort to conceal his chagrin, his face hardened towards me, but I went on doggedly, ‘I cannot show you the scrolls, but perhaps I can lead you to the treasure that the grand vizier has stolen from you, and from the people of your realm. It was I who built his secret treasuries for him, and hid within them the bounty that I gathered from the barons. It was in these store-rooms that I placed the wealth that Pharaoh’s tax-collectors never saw.’</p>

    <p>The king’s excitement rekindled, hot as the coals on the coppersmith’s forge. He leaned forward intently. Although every eye in the temple was fastened upon me, and the nobles were crowding forward the better to hear each word, I was watching Lord Intef without seeming to look in his direction. The burnished copper doors of the sanctuary were tall mirrors in which his reflection was magnified. Every nuance of his expression and every movement he made, however slight, was clear to me.</p>

    <p>I had taken a fatal risk in assuming that his treasure still remained in the secret places where I had stored it for him. He might have moved it at any time during the past two years. Yet moving such quantities of treasure would have been a major work and the risk of doing so as great as letting it rest where it lay. He would have been forced to take others into his trust, and that was not easy for Lord Intef to do. He was by nature a suspicious man. Added to which was the fact that, until recently, he had believed me dead, and my secret with me.</p>

    <p>I calculated that my chances were evenly balanced, and I risked my life on it. Now I held my breath as I watched Lord Intef’s reflection in the copper doors. Then my heart raced and my spirits soared on the wings of eagles. I saw from the pain and panic in his expression that the arrow I had fired at him had struck the mark. I had won. The treasure was where I had left it. I knew that I could lead Pharaoh to the plunder and the loot that Lord Intef had gathered up over his lifetime.</p>

    <p>But he was not yet defeated. I was rash to believe it would be so easily accomplished. I saw him make a gesture with his right hand that puzzled me, and while I dallied, it was almost too late.</p>

    <p>In my triumph, I had forgotten Rasfer. The signal that Lord Intef gave him was a flick of the right hand, but Rasfer responded like a trained boar-hound to the huntsman’s command to attack. He launched himself at me with such sudden ferocity that he took all of us by complete surprise. He had only ten pace’s to cover to reach me, and his sword rasped from its scabbard as he came.</p>

    <p>There were two of Kratas’ men standing between us, but their backs were turned to him, and Rasfer barged into them and knocked them off their feet, so that one of them sprawled across the stone flags in front of Tanus and blocked his path when he tried to spring to my aid. I was on my own, defenceless, and Rasfer threw up his sword with both hands to cleave through my skull to my breast-bone. I lifted my hands to ward off the blow, but my legs were frozen with shock and terror, and I could not move or duck away from the hissing blade.</p>

    <p>I never saw Tanus throw his sword. I had eyes for nothing but the face of Rasfer, but suddenly the sword was in the air. Terror had so enhanced my senses that time seemed to pass as slowly as spilled oil dribbling from the jar. I watched Tanus’ sword turning end over end, spinning slowly on its axis, flashing at each revolution like a sheet of summer lightning, but it had not completed a full turn when it struck, and it was the hilt and not the point that crashed into Rasfer’s head. It did not kill him, but it snapped his head over, whipping his neck like the branch of a willow in the wind, so that his eyes rolled back blindly in their sockets.</p>

    <p>Rasfer never completed the blow he aimed at me. His legs collapsed under him and he fell in a pile at my feet. His sword flew from his nerveless fingers, spinning high in the air, and then fell back. It pegged into the side of Pharaoh’s throne, and quivered there. The king stared at it in shocked disbelief. The razor edge had touched his arm, and split the skin. As we all watched, a line of ruby droplets oozed from the shallow wound, and dripped on to Pharaoh’s cloud-white linen kilt.</p>

    <p>Tanus broke the horrified silence. ‘Great Egypt, you saw who gave the signal for this beast to attack. You know who was to blame for endangering your royal person.’ He leaped over the downed guardsman and seized Lord Intef by the arm, twisting it until he fell to his knees and cried out with pain.</p>

    <p>‘I did not want to believe this of you.’ Pharaoh’s expression was sorrowful as he looked down on his grand vizier. ‘I have trusted you all my life, and you have spat upon me.’</p>

    <p>‘Great Egypt, hear me!’ Lord Intef begged on his knees, but Pharaoh turned his face away from him.</p>

    <p>‘I have listened to you long enough.’ Then he nodded to Tanus. ‘Have your men guard him well, but show him courtesy, for his guilt is not yet fully proven.’</p>

    <p>Finally Pharaoh addressed the congregation. ‘These are strange and unprecedented events. I adjourn these proceedings to consider fully the evidence that Taita the slave will present.to me. The population of Thebes will assemble once again to hear my judgement in this same place at noon tomorrow. I have spoken.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">WE ENTERED THROUGH THE MAIN DOORWAY to the audience hall of the grand vizier’s palace. Pharaoh paused at the threshold. Although the wound from Rasfer’s sword was slight, I had bandaged it with linen and placed his arm in a sling.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh surveyed the hall slowly. At the far end of the long room stood the grand vizier’s throne. Carved from a solid block of alabaster, it was hardly less imposing than Pharaoh’s own in the throne room at Elephantine. The high walls were plastered with smooth clay and on this background were painted some of the most impressive frescoes that I had ever designed. They transformed the huge room into a blazing garden of delights. I had painted them while I was Lord Intef’s slave, and even though they were my own creations, they still gave me a deep thrill of pleasure when I looked upon them.</p>

    <p>I have no doubt that these works alone, without consideration of any other of my achievements, would support my claim to the title of the most significant artist in the history of our land. It was sad that I who had created them was now to demolish them. It detracted from the triumph of this tumultuous day.</p>

    <p>I led Pharaoh down the hall. For once we had dispensed with all protocol, and Pharaoh was as eager as a child. He followed me so closely that he almost trod upon my heels, and his royal train fell in as eagerly behind him.</p>

    <p>I led them to the throne wall and we stopped below the huge mural depicting the sun god, Ammon-Ra, on his daily journey across the heavens. Even in his excitement, I could see the reverent expression in the king’s eyes as he looked up at the painting.</p>

    <p>Behind us, the great hall was half-filled with the king’s train, the courtiers and the warriors and the noble lords, to say nothing of the royal wives and concubines who would rather have given up all their rouges and paint-boxes of cosmetics than miss such an exciting moment as I had promised them. Naturally, my mistress was in the forefront. Tanus marched only a pace behind the king. He and his Blues had taken over the duties of the royal bodyguard.</p>

    <p>The king turned back to Tanus now. ‘Have your men bring forward the Lord Intef!’</p>

    <p>Treating him with elaborate and icy courtesy, Kratas led Intef to face the wall, but he interposed himself between the prisoner and the king and stood with his naked blade at the ready.</p>

    <p>‘Taita, you may proceed,’ the king told me, and I measured the wall, stepping out exactly thirty paces from the furthest corner and marking the distance with the lump of chalk that I had brought with me for the purpose.</p>

    <p>‘Behind this wall lie the private quarters of the grand vizier,’ I explained to the king. ‘Certain alterations were made when last the palace was renovated. Lord Intef likes to have his wealth close at hand.’</p>

    <p>‘Sometimes you are garrulous, Taita.’ Pharaoh was less than captivated by my lecture on the palace architecture. ‘Get on with it, fellow. I am aflame to see what is hidden here.’</p>

    <p>‘Let the masons approach!’ I called out, and a small band of these sturdy rogues in their leather aprons came down the aisle and dropped their leather tool-bags at the foot of the throne wall. I had summoned them across the river from their work on Pharaoh’s tomb. The white stone-dust in their hair gave them an air of age and wisdom that few of them deserved.</p>

    <p>I borrowed a wooden set-square from their foreman, and with it marked out an oblong shape on the clay-plastered wall. Then I stepped back and addressed the,master mason.</p>

    <p>‘Gently now! Damage the frescoes as little as you can. They are great works of art.’</p>

    <p>With their wooden mallets and their chisels of flint, they fell upon the wall, and they paid little heed to my strictures. Paint and plaster flew in clouds as slabs of the outer wall were stripped away and thumped to the marble floor. The dust offended the ladies and they covered their mouths and noses with their shawls.</p>

    <p>Gradually from under the layer of plaster emerged the outline of the stone blocks. Then Pharaoh exclaimed aloud and, ignoring the flying dust, he drew closer, and peered at the design that appeared from beneath the plaster skin. The regular courses of stone blocks were marred by an oblong of alien-coloured stone that followed almost exactly the outline I had chalked upon the outer layer of plaster.</p>

    <p>“There is a hidden door in there,’ he cried. ‘Open it immediately!’</p>

    <p>Under the king’s urging, the masons attacked the sealed doorway with a will, and once they had removed the keystone, the other blocks came out readily. A dark opening was revealed, and Pharaoh, who had by now taken charge of the work, called excitedly for torches to be lit.</p>

    <p>‘The entire space behind this wall is a secret compartment,’ I told Pharaoh, while we waited for the torches to be brought to us. ‘I had it constructed on Lord Intef’s orders.’</p>

    <p>When the torches were brought, Tanus took one of them and lit the king’s way into the gaping secret door. The king stepped through, and I was the next to enter after him and Tanus.</p>

    <p>It was so long since I had last been in there that I looked around me’with as much interest as the others. Nothing had changed in all that time. The chests and casks of cedar and acacia wood were stacked exactly as I had left them. I pointed out to the king those cases to which he should first devote his attention, and he ordered, ‘Have them carried out into the audience hall.’</p>

    <p>‘You will need strong men to carry them,’ I remarked drily. They are rather heavy.’</p>

    <p>It took three of the biggest men of the Blues to lift each case and they staggered out through the jagged opening in the wall with them.</p>

    <p>‘I have never seen these boxes before,’ Lord Intef protested, as the first of them was carried out and laid on the dais of the grand vizier’s throne. ‘I had no knowledge of a secret chamber behind the wall. It must have been built by my predecessor, and the cases placed there at his command.’</p>

    <p>‘Your Majesty, observe the seal on this lid.’ I pointed it out to him and the king peered at the clay tablet.</p>

    <p>‘Whose seal is this?’ he demanded.</p>

    <p>‘Observe the ring on the left forefinger of the grand vizier, Majesty,’ I murmured. ‘May I respectfully suggest that Pharaoh match it to the seal on this chest?’</p>

    <p>‘Lord Intef, hand me your ring if you please,’ the king asked with exaggerated courtesy, and the grand vizier hid his left hand behind his back.</p>

    <p>‘Great Egypt, the ring has been on my finger for twenty years. My flesh has grown around it and it cannot now be removed.’</p>

    <p>‘Lord Tanus.’ The king turned to him. ‘Take your sword. Remove Lord Intef’s finger and bring it to me with the ring upon it.’ Tanus smiled cruelly as he stepped forward to obey, half-drawing his blade.</p>

    <p>‘Perhaps I am mistaken,’ Lord Intef admitted with alacrity. ‘Let me see if I cannot free it.’ The ring slipped readily enough from his finger, and Tanus went down on one knee to hand it to the king.</p>

    <p>Pharaoh bent studiously over the chest and made the comparison of ring to seal. When he straightened up again his face was dark with anger.</p>

    <p>‘It is a perfect match. This seal was struck from your ring, Lord Intef.’ But the grand vizier made no reply to the accusation. He stood with his arms folded and his- expression stony.</p>

    <p>‘Break the seal. Open the chest!’ Pharaoh ordered, and Tanus cut away the clay tablet and prised up the lid with his sword.</p>

    <p>The king cried out involuntarily as the lid fell away and the contents were revealed, ‘By all the gods!’ And his courtiers crowded forward without ceremony to gaze into the chest, exclaiming and jostling each other for a better view.</p>

    <p>‘Gold!’ The king scooped both hands full with the glittering yellow rings, and then let them cascade back between his fingers. He kept a single ring in his hand and held it close to his face to study the mint marks upon it. ‘Two deben weight of fine gold. How much will this case contain, and how many cases are there in the secret store-room?’ His question was rhetorical, and he was not expecting an answer, but I gave him a reply nevertheless.</p>

    <p>‘This case contains?’ I read the manifest that I had inscribed on the lid so many years before. ‘It contains one takh and three hundred deben of pure gold. As to how many cases of gold, if my memory serves me well, there should be fifty-three of gold and twenty-three of silver in this store. However, I have forgotten exactly how many chests of jewellery we hid here.’</p>

    <p>‘Is there no one I can trust? You, Lord Intef, I treated as my brother. There was no kindness that you did not receive from my hands, and this is how you have repaid me.’</p>

    <p class="Chap">AT MIDNIGHT THE CHANCELLOR AND THE chief inspector of the royal taxes came to the king’s chamber where I was changing the dressing on his injured arm. They presented their final tally of the amount of the treasure and Pharaoh read it with awe. Once again, his emotions warred with each other, outrage vying with euphoria at this staggering windfall.</p>

    <p>‘The rogue was richer than his own king. There is no punishment harsh enough for such evil. He has cheated and robbed me and my tax-collectors.’</p>

    <p>‘As well as murdering and plundering Lord Harrab and tens of thousands of your subjects,’ I reminded him, as I secured the bandage on his arm. It was perhaps impudent of me. However, he was by now so deep in my debt that I could risk it.</p>

    <p>‘That too,’ he agreed readily enough, my sarcasm wasted upon him. ‘His guilt is deep as the sea and high as the heaven. I will have to devise a suitable punishment. The strangler’s rope is too kind for Lord Intef.’</p>

    <p>‘Majesty, as your physician, I must insist that you rest now. It has been a day that has taxed even your great strength and endurance.’</p>

    <p>‘Where is Intef? I cannot rest until I am assured that he is well taken care of.’</p>

    <p>‘He is under guard in his own quarters, Majesty. A senior captain and a detachment of the Blues have that duty.’ I hesitated delicately. ‘Rasfer is also under guard.’</p>

    <p>‘Rasfer, that ugly drooling animal of his? The one who tried to kill you in the temple of Osiris? Did he survive the crack that Lord Tanus gave him?’</p>

    <p>‘He is well if not happy, Pharaoh,’ I assured him. ‘Did Your Majesty know that Rasfer is the one who, so long ago, used the gelding-knife upon me?’ I saw the beam of pity in the king’s eye, as I blurted it out.</p>

    <p>‘I will deal with him as I deal with his master,’ Pharaoh promised. ‘He will suffer the same punishment as Lord Intef. Will that satisfy you, Taita?’</p>

    <p>‘Your Majesty is just and omniscient.’ I backed out of his presence and went to find my mistress.</p>

    <p>She was waiting for me and, although it was after midnight and I was exhausted, she would not let me sleep. She was far too overwrought, and she insisted that for the rest of the night I sit beside her bed and listen to her chatter about Tanus and other topics of lesser importance.</p>
