<h2>Chapter 9<br/>
Barrels Out of Bond</h2>
<p class="normal"></p>
<p class="normal">The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves tried for the last time to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. They got up and walked on. Suddenly they saw Wood elves with their bows and spears. They told the dwarves to stop. There was no thought of a fight. So they simply stopped and sat down and waited – all except Bilbo, who put on his ring and disappeared.</p>
<p class="normal">The elves bound the dwarves in a long line. Bilbo was walking silently behind them. Suddenly the torches stopped, and they began to cross the bridge. The bridge led across the river to the king’s doors. In a great hall with pillars sat the king on a wooden chair. On his head was a crown of berries and red leaves, for it was autumn again. In the spring he wore a crown of woodland flowers. In his hand he held a staff of oak.</p>
<p class="normal">The prisoners were brought before him; he told his men to unbind them. “They need no ropes in here,” said he. “There is no escape from my magic doors for those who are once brought inside.”</p>
<p class="normal">The king asked the dwarves about their doings, and where they were going to, and where they were coming from; but he didn’t get more news out of them than out of Thorin. They were angry and did not even pretend to be polite.</p>
<p class="normal">“What have we done, king?” said Balin, who was the eldest now. “Is it a crime to be lost in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders?” The king answered: “It is a crime to wander in my kingdom without leave. Do you forget that you were in my kingdom, using the road that my people made? Did you not pursue and trouble my people in the forest? Now I have a right to know why you came here, and so tell me now, or I will keep you all in prison!” Then he ordered to put the dwarves in separate cells and to give them food and drink. But be did not tell them that Thorin was also his prisoner. Bilbo found that out.</p>
<p class="normal">Poor Mr Baggins lived in that place all alone; he didn’t take off his ring. Bilbo walked around the king’s palace to know it better.</p>
<p class="normal">Eventually he managed to find out where each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different parts of the palace. One day he heard the talk of the guards and learned that there was another dwarf in prison too, in a deep dark place. He guessed at once, of course, that that was Thorin. At last after many difficulties he managed to find the place, and to talk with the chief of the dwarves. Thorin felt miserable, and was even beginning to think of telling the king all about his treasure and his quest, when he heard Bilbo’s little voice at his keyhole. He could hardly believe his ears. Soon he had a long talk with the hobbit on the other side.</p>
<p class="normal">So Bilbo took secretly Thorin’s message to each of the other dwarves, telling them that Thorin, their chief, was also in prison, and he told them not to open their secret. The other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They didn’t want to share the treasure, and they all trusted Bilbo.</p>
<p class="normal">Bilbo sat and thought and thought, but no bright idea came.</p>
<p class="normal">One day Bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the great gates were not the only entrance to the caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the palace, and joined the Forest River. There was a water gate at the place where underground water came out of the mountain. There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the stream, and from it a grating could be dropped right to the bed of the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that way. But the grating was often open, because a lot of traffic went out and in by the water gate. There was a dark tunnel leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one point the roof had an opening which was covered with great oaken trapdoors. These opened up into the king’s cellars. There stood many barrels. The Wood elves, and especially their king, liked wine very much. The wine and other goods were brought from far away, from the vineyards of Men in distant lands.</p>
<p class="normal">Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, and learned how the wine and other goods came from the Long Lake. There was a town of Men there built on bridges. From Lake town the barrels were brought up the Forest River. Often the barrels were tied together; sometimes they were loaded onto flat boats.</p>
<p class="normal">When the barrels were empty the elves dropped them through the trapdoors, opened the water gate, and the barrels floated out on the stream, until they were carried by the current to the eastern edge of Mirkwood. There they were collected and tied together and floated back to Lake town, which stood close to the point where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake.</p>
<p class="normal">For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water gate. He wanted to use it for the escape of his friends, and at last he had a plan.</p>
<p class="normal">One evening two guards took meal to the prisoners and then decided to taste the new wine that had just come in. Bilbo followed the two elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily.</p>
<p class="normal">In a little while the guards were fast asleep.</p>
<p class="normal">Then the hobbit stole the keys from the guards and went to unlock the dwarves’ cells.</p>
<p class="normal">First he unlocked Balin’s door, and locked it again carefully as soon as the dwarf was outside. Balin was most surprised and wanted to ask a lot of questions, but the hobbit just said, “No time now! You must follow me! We must all keep together. All of us must escape, and this is our last chance.”</p>
<p class="normal">Then he opened other cells. All went well, and they met no guards. Fortunately there was a great autumn feast that night. Almost all the king’s folks were eating, drinking and dancing. At last Bilbo and the dwarves came to Thorin’s dungeon, which was not far from the cellars.</p>
<p class="normal">When Bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his friends, Thorin said, “Gandalf spoke true, as usual. You are a fine burglar. Now we are all for ever at your service. But what comes next?” Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea.</p>
<p class="normal">At first the dwarves didn’t like Bilbo’s plan at all, but in the end they had to do just what Bilbo suggested. So they followed the hobbit and crept down into the lowest cellars.</p>
<p class="normal">There was little time to lose. The empty barrels were standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off. Soon they found thirteen barrels with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact the barrels were too large, and Bilbo put some straw inside. At last twelve dwarves were packed. Bilbo closed holes in the sides of the barrels, and now he was left alone again.</p>
<p class="normal">In a minute or two elves came laughing into the cellars. They had left a merry feast in one of the halls and wanted to return as soon as they could.</p>
<p class="normal">So they quickly rolled one barrel and then another to the dark opening and soon all the barrels with dwarves went down.</p>
<p class="normal">At this moment Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there anyone to pack him in!</p>
<p class="normal">Now the elves were rolling the last barrel to the doors! In despair poor little Bilbo held it tightly and was pushed down with it. He fell down into the water with the barrel on top of him. He came up again clinging to the wood like a rat, but he could not scramble on top. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above. Then suddenly the trapdoors fell with a boom and their voices faded away. He was in the dark tunnel, in icy water, all alone.</p>
<p class="normal">At last Mr Baggins came to a place where the trees grew thinner. The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there it joined the main water of the Forest River flowing down from the king’s great doors. Then the water of the Forest River swept all the barrels away to the north bank. On the shallow shore most of the barrels ran aground. There were people on the banks. They quickly pushed all the barrels together, and when they had counted them they tied them together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo slipped from his barrel, and then quietly walked to some small houses that he could see near the water’s edge. He was cold, wet and hungry.</p>
<p class="normal">Bilbo had to steal a loaf and a bottle of wine and a pie. He started sneezing and he left wet footprints, so the rest of the night he had to pass wet and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he even slept a little on some dry leaves.</p>
<p class="normal">Bilbo woke again with a loud sneeze. It was already grey morning. He was no longer dripping but he felt really cold. He scrambled down as fast as he could and managed to get onto the barrels. The elves started pushing the barrels with their poles down to Lake town.</p>
<p class="normal">So the dwarves and Bilbo had escaped the dungeons of the king.</p>
