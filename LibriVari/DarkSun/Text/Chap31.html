  <h1>31</h1>

  <p class="normal">WHILE breakfasting, they wondered who would be eaten for supper. Fat Bull answered that sometime later by pointing out Tishdom. She screamed and struggled but was carried off and tied to the post. Presently, she was limp and silent, having failed also. Her body was taken back over the hill to be prepared for lunch, not supper. It was Shig, last of the slaves, who provided this item.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman then indicated that Deyv was next. He stood pale, in shock, while Vana embraced him and wept.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You won't have to question the god right now," Fat Bull said. "You have until some time before the next supper to figure out how to please Phemropit."</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is ridiculous!" Sloosh buzzed. "You stupid Narakannetishaw could kill off the entire population of the world and still not get what you want from the god. You're going at this the wrong way. Phemropit doesn't have the slightest idea what you're trying to do. He doesn't know your language, but he is trying to communicate with you.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What you lamebrains must do is what you did with us. That is, teach him your language."</p>

  <p class="normal">His colleagues didn't think it was discreet to insult the person who held their lives in his hands. But then, what difference did it make?</p>

  <p class="normal">"He is our god," Fat Bull said. "Are you telling me that our god wouldn't be able to speak with our tongue?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes," Sloosh said. "It would be obvious to any but the lowest intelligence that he doesn't. Or perhaps I should say that it's not so much a lack of intelligence that has made you err as your pattern of thinking. To you a god can do anything, so this one must be able to speak your language. At the same time, you have refused to see that Phemropit is, for some reason, immobile. He's not moving because he doesn't want to move but because he can't."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll overlook your insults, cabbage-head," the shaman said. "I can understand why you're not so friendly. But what you say about Phemropit isn't true. He's a god, and soâ€”"</p>

  <p class="normal">"And so he can do anything he wishes to do. Nonsense! I can prove to you that he can't move."</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman looked interested. He strode away and picked up his sticks and threw them seven times. Then he came back.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Deyv must still be tied to the post. The gods so decree it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Very well," the Archkerri said. "Tie him to it. But first move the post a few feet to one side."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But then the god can't see him!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You just said your god could do anything. Why couldn't he see Deyv? I'll guarantee that the god will be able to see him."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And if the guarantee is no good? What then?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then I'll let you tie me to the post."</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman burst out into shrill piping laughter.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'll <i>let</i> me? You have a fine sense of humor, walking cauliflower. Very well. I'll do as you suggest. I do want to tell the god what to do, for his best interests and ours. Look!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He pointed down the slope to the right of the god. A warrior was just putting the cube on the ground.</p>

  <p class="normal">"While I slept, my ancestor, White Flippers, came to me and said that I should tell the god that if he doesn't talk to us we'll destroy him with that."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed in his own speech so that the shaman couldn't understand him. "I've heard of bribing gods but never of threatening them. Well, theology is a strange business, but it has its own logic, I suppose."</p>

  <p class="normal">To Fat Bull he said, "How do you propose to blow up Phemropit without also destroying yourselves?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Easy. We'll tie a rope to the rod and another rope to that one and as many ropes as are needed. Then we'll hide behind this hill so we'll be protected when we pull on the end of the rope."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh closed his eyes. Deyv cried out in Vana's speech that Sloosh mustn't tell Fat Bull the truth. As long as the shaman believed that the cube was what Deyv said it was, he might be tricked.</p>

  <p class="normal">The plant-man opened his eyes. "I wasn't contemplating telling him the truth. I was just wondering why he was ignoring your statement that the cube would slay everything between here and the ocean."</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman said, "What are you talking about? I don't like to have you jabber away in your gibberish. Are you telling each other ways to fool me? Believe me, you won't get away with it"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No," Sloosh said, "that's not it. We were talking about what would happen if you did trigger off the cube's devastating powers. You have forgotten that it will sear the jungle for miles around. The back of the hill wouldn't shield you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think you're lying," Fat Bull said. "No magical device could be that powerful. You just want to scare us so much we'll be afraid to use it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv could see, by the light of the torch whose end was stuck in the ground, that the rope was not only being tied to the rod, it was being glued.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're right," he said to Fat Bull. "We were lying. You'll be quite safe if you hide behind the hill, though you might be knocked down by the blast. However, you can't threaten the god unless you can speak his tongue."</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman went away to do some thinking about that. After a while, he returned. He ordered that the post be moved a few feet to one side.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "Sloosh, I hope you know what you're talking about."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If I'm wrong, I'll apologize."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's very comforting."</p>

  <p class="normal">The digging up of the post was interrupted by an earthquake so severe that it rippled the earth and cracked open the beach. Other temblors, not so strong, followed. When it seemed that there might not be more, everybody got up off the ground, and business was resumed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv saw a pair of red eyes glowing in the bush behind a warrior with a torch. He wondered if it could be Jum's or Aejip's. At the moment, he was unbound. If he broke for the jungle, he might make it. No. There were too many armed Tsimmanbul around. They'd porcupine him with spears before he got forty feet away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "I think we could have left the post where it was. The quake has shifted the so-called god a little to its right."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri explained what he wanted done. Deyv said, "Why do I have to be tied to the post? I won't run away."</p>

  <p class="normal">After thinking about this strange proposal, the shaman said, "Well, it's not according to proper procedure. No, you can't be free."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh asked for a number of objects, and he picked up a flat but thick stone about two feet across. He accompanied Deyv to the post, and after some hesitation Fat Bull joined them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I want to know exactly what you're doing when you're doing it," he said. "And speak only my language."</p>

  <p class="normal">The plant-man waited until Deyv was tied, then he handed him the firefly. "As the Narakannetishaw have noted, the god emits light pulses of four differing lengths. They're in groups, obviously some sort of photonic words. What we have to do is to teach him our, that is, my language. Once he learns that, we can start to learn his."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv extended the firefly in his left hand and began pressing on the insect. Sloosh had wanted to omit the ritual, but Fat Bull had insisted it be retained. At the end, the light beam shot out, but it struck the flat stone. Sloosh, standing to one side, had held it out in his hand. He withdrew it and looked at its surface. The beam had made a very small depression, warm around the rim.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It wouldn't damage the metal-stone of its own kind," he said. "I suspect that that is shot with nickel-iron."</p>

  <p class="normal">He persuaded the shaman to set up another pole but one which had a slot at its top to hold the stone upright. Deyv began triggering flashes while the Archkerri held up some of the objects. Presently, the god-thing was repeating Deyv's words.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now," Sloosh said to the shaman, "do you see what a little intelligence may accomplish? You could have done this long ago. And you wouldn't have killed so many people so uselessly."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They weren't so useless," Fat Bull said. "They made very good eating. Tell me, how long will it be before Phemropit will be able to understand me well?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"At least as long as it took us to learn your speech and perhaps longer. After all, the god may have a mind which is very alien to ours. He may think in somewhat different categories, though I'm sure many of his must overlap ours."</p>

  <p class="normal">Fat Bull said that the tribe couldn't stay out there that long. As it was, they took a chance of being attacked by their enemies every time they came here. He hurried off to make arrangements while Sloosh and Deyv continued the lessons. The shaman's people wished to observe the lessons, and they loathed the idea of not eating their captives. But, after Fat Bull berated them, they packed up.</p>

  <p class="normal">Twelve warriors and three females stayed behind as guards. To make sure that the prisoners wouldn't escape, the guards bound their hands and feet. Only when the captives were exercising or teaching Phemropit were they untied.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Actually, I don't need you," the shaman said. "I can give lessons to him myself. But why should I do all the work? Besides, you might arm yourselves and come back for revenge. I'll let you loose when the whole tribe returns to witness the god as he starts for our village."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What about my sword?" Deyv said. "You promisedâ€”"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I promised you could go free. That's all."</p>

  <p class="normal">Fat Bull was wearing Deyv's ancient blade in a scabbard. He'd also appropriated Sloosh's huge axe. He was not going to give up such immensely valuable weapons. Deyv didn't blame him; he'd have done the same thing in the shaman's position. He was not, however, going to leave the vicinity without trying to get the weapons back. Probably the shaman knew this and was counting on him to return. Then he'd be able, with a clear conscience, to take him captive again and have him for supper. No doubt, he was hoping to catch all of them again.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Does that mean we also can't have our cube back?" Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Fat Bull's big dark eyes narrowed. His high forehead and protruding face made him look part-human, part-fish, part-pig.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I need that to control the god."</p>

  <p class="normal">Seven sleep-times passed. A messenger came from the village. He said that the male appointed by Fat Bull to guard and feed the captives' two animals had been found dead and half-eaten in front of the cabin. Evidently, they had somehow gotten to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv asked the shaman if that meant that Jum and Aejip would be killed if he called them in from the jungle. He'd seen them twice skulking around its edges.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not if you guarantee they won't attack us," Fat Bull said. "Actually, I don't mind much that they put an end to Whistling Eagle. He was very insolent, which is why I punished him by making him stay behind."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv shouted their names until Jum came bouncing in, tail wagging, and, slavering, had swarmed all over him. The cat slunk in, not trusting the Tsimmanbul. Once she was assured that she was safe, she leaped, fawning upon Vana. Deyv's jealousy was only slightly diminished when she came to him afterward and leaned rumbling against his leg.</p>

  <p class="normal">The lessons continued with, by now, all of Deyv's party except the blind witch and Fat Bull taking turns as teachers. Phemropit didn't tire; he apparently could store information and retrieve it as if he were a machine. He also learned, after the fourth sleep-time, that his light beam would penetrate the flesh of its teachers. He at once softened the beam so that it would only warm their skins.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once it was time for him to learn abstractions, however, he began having trouble understanding. The concept of sex was for the moment beyond him. He didn't grasp how his interrogators ate or the reason why. He also had trouble comprehending the idea of individuation.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It will understand these in time," Sloosh said. "But they are not in its experience, and so it just can't visualize or feel them. I refer to Phemropit as it, not <i>him,</i> since it has no sex."</p>

  <p class="normal">Another series of earth shocks struck the camp. The crack in the beach widened. Some of the trees on the slope toppled over. The huts and the log cabin were tumbled. Sometime afterward a giant wave roared in from the lake, and it and those that followed washed away the earth from beneath the fallen tree. It floated away, leaving the god-thing with its rear hanging over a six-foot-high cliff.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh asked Phemropit if it could move higher up.</p>

  <p class="normal">It replied that it could, but it didn't want to unless it was absolutely necessary. The energy required to do this would take too much of its fuel supply. As it was, the lessons, though not drawing on much of its energy, did weaken it. Sloosh didn't understand its explanation fully, but he thought that the thing would have to go into a suspended animation soon. That is, unless it could be provided with the stuff which provided its energy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's been in a sort of hibernation, if I may use a biological analog," the plant-man said. "Then, some human generations ago, it decided to make an effort to force its way up from burial. It did so, but the effort took a lot of its limited fuel. I think that it <i>eats</i> rock which contains radioactive elements. I've explained what these are to you, though none of you seem to understand them."</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked at them, then said, "If it runs out of the elements needed, it dies. In a sense, that is. It could stay <i>dead</i> for a very long time, yet would have the potential for coming alive again as long as its metal-stone body wasn't badly damaged."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "What happens if its energy does run out now? Won't Fat Bull consider that he doesn't have to keep his promise? He won't have much use for a dead, or at least sleeping, god."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We won't tell him about this. But if Phemropit should cease to talk to us, we'd better run."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let's hope that Phemropit doesn't say anything to Fat Bull about this."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Phemropit won't bring up the subject."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why don't we think about how to kill the Tsimmanbul so we can get on to the land of The Shemibob?" Hoozisst asked. "We're wasting time with this talking rock."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't you have any curiosity about Phemropit?" Sloosh buzzed disgustedly. "Here's a creature unknown to Earth until now, a being of stone and metal that has a language and hence a sentient nervous system."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri raved on, but the Yawtl only smirked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Though he admitted that the plant-man knew far more than he did, he also thought that Sloosh was mentally off-balance and very impractical. If Hoozisst could have profited by staying on, he would have been all for it. But this business was most aggravating and frustrating.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri didn't get to finish his lecture. The ground began rumbling and rippling, and then with a loud crack like the snap of a giant whip, the earth separated nearby. It was only a zigzag opening about three inches wide, but they didn't know what horrible sequel to expect. There was no place to run. In any event, the earth was shaking so much they couldn't even stand up.</p>

  <p class="normal">Trees fell right and left, and one rolled toward them, its branches breaking off. It stopped short of crushing them, but the ends of some snapped-off branches lay only a few inches away. A huge boulder smashed into the tree and bounced over it, narrowly missing a Tsimmanbul.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the temblors had faded away, everybody got up and ran toward the top of the hill. Deyy, Vana, Hoozisst, Feersh, and her daughter had their hands tied in front of them. They fell, but they managed to get up and struggle upward.</p>

  <p class="normal">Another shock, as intense as the first one, rocked the top of the hill just as they reached it. The boulders there fell on either side of the slopes. One roared by the god, almost striking it, and stopped some feet past the shoreline.</p>

  <p class="normal">A long time later a tsunami smashed into the hill, reaching halfway up. Wave after wave made the hill shudder, covering Phemropit, washing the ground from under him, snatching the uprooted trees away, and moving the boulders back and forth.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the midst of this terror, only Sloosh was able to talk. Watching the ocean battle for the stone-metal creature, he said, "Too bad! Too bad! I would have found out so much about its kind!"</p>

  <p class="normal">When the ocean finally subsided, Phemropit was not in sight.</p>

  <p class="normal">Fortunately, though the cube had been yanked savagely many times and once struck by a boulder, it had not been carried away. The rope-chain, the other end of which was fastened to a tree at the bottom of the opposite slope, had held.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My god is gone!" the shaman cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Some god," the Yawtl said. "Here we are, safe, but the god of the sea has proven mightier than the god from outer space. I thinkâ€”"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What you think is wrong," Sloosh said. He pointed down to the riven beach.</p>

  <p class="normal">Out of the' sea rose the shiny dark-gray back of Phemropit. In a short time, its whole body was in sight, its endless tracks with their treads rotating. It came up the beach, then began climbing the hill. Though it slipped back in the soft earth three times, it kept on, and presently it was resting on the top. Its "nose" pointed slightly downward.</p>
