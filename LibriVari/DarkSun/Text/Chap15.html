  <h1>15</h1>

  <p class="normal">WITHOUT symbionts to supply food for gas generation, the <i>tharakorm</i> would slowly settle. At least, that was Sloosh's theory. However, if the cell walls did seep gas, they were not doing so swiftly enough for the present crew. Its members would be dead long before it touched the ground. At Sloosh's direction, they punched one spot on a wall with the sword and beat it with the tomahawks. The wall, though thinner than Vana's fingernail, was amazingly tough. It took all the time between two sleeps to break through. However, lack of food and water made the job longer. The labor also made them hungrier and thirstier than if they'd been resting. At its end they were utterly exhausted.</p>

  <p class="normal">A strong wind came up and sped them along for at least a hundred miles. The Archkerri lost the red trail of the Yawtl then.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We may never find him now," he said. "For one thing, he's alone. He may not be able to make a hole in the cell of his <i>tharakorm.</i> Even if he does, he won't be able to do it as quickly .as we did. Thus, his <i>tharakorm</i> will go much farther than ours. And it is undoubtedly traveling in a different direction from ours. The wind must have shifted and blown him off our path before this big wind came up."</p>

  <p class="normal">"At the moment," Vana said in a dry, cracked voice, "I care only about getting water to drink. And then some food."</p>

  <p>At last the ship-creature landed on the roof of the jungle in the midst of the tossing tops of the trees. The moment it struck, it tilted, and all its crew were rolled off the deck and into the trees. The second it was relieved of their weight, the tharakorm soared and was gone. Deyv, the last to be shed, saw it rise even as he pitched sideways into the foliage. Yelling with fright, he clawed outward. His hands caught liana, which broke, and he fell deeper. Something, probably a branch, struck him, knocking him half-senseless. Somehow, he caught hold of a thin branch. It broke, and he fell flat on his back on a large branch.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wind was knocked out of him. For a moment, he didn't know where he was. But once his wits were gathered, he knew that he was, for the time being, safe.</p>

  <p class="normal">Miraculously, nobody was seriously hurt. Sloosh, by far the heaviest, had plunged deeper. A network of liana had finally held him. Jum had landed almost by the Archkerri's side a few seconds later. Unable to hold on to the branch above Sloosh, the dog had been precipitated, howling, onto the plant-man.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana was clinging to the end of a branch bending under her weight. She managed to crawl up it to a thicker part. Aejip was hanging on to the trunk, her claws digging in.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took a long time for Deyv to work his way above the Archkerri and the dog. He tied one end of his rope to the junction of a smaller branch and to that on which he lay. Sloosh tied the other end of the rope to Jum, and Deyv lowered the dog to a big branch. Sloosh went down the rope then, his immensely strong hands and arms gripping it and supporting his six hundred pounds. Deyv expected the rope to break, but it held.</p>

  <p class="normal">They rested on the branch a long time, eating fruit plucked from surrounding branches. Once his belly was filled and the juices had eased his thirst, Deyv slept for a while. On awakening, he and Vana began the work of getting the dog and the plant-man to earth. When the four of them had reached the ground, they found the cat devouring the decaying carcass of a 10-pound rodent. Deyv insisted that she share it with the dog. Though she snarled protest, she did as ordered.</p>

  <p>Within two sleep-times, they'd healed their bruises, scratches, and contusions. They came out of the jungle onto a wide plain. This was covered with grasses of various kinds, none higher than three feet. It was populated by herds of herbivores, attendant predators, and vast numbers of birds and flying mammals. And, of course, the ever-present insects and quasi-insects.</p>

  <p class="normal">Halfway across the plain they came across a strange object lying against two small trees. Its cylindrical shape and the cone at one end made Deyv think at first that it was a House of the ancients. It was a hundred feet long, had a diameter of thirty-five feet, and was of some hard greenish material. On seeing that it had no windows and only one entrance, Deyv decided that it wasn't a House. How could anybody have entered it when it was upright? The doorway would be fifty feet above the ground.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Very curious," Sloosh said. "I don't remember coming across anything like this in my studies."</p>

  <p class="normal">The round door had no handle, but there was a plate that was slightly inset nearby. Deyv pushed the plate, and the door began to swing inward.</p>

  <p class="normal">He and Vana jumped back, ready to run if anything dangerous-looking came out. But when the door stopped, it revealed a room empty except for some furniture.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed his equivalent of "Hmm!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Jum growled, and Deyv looked at him. The dog was not facing the cylinder, as he'd expected. He was pointing back toward the direction from which they'd come.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Oh, oh!" Deyv said. "Trouble. Maybe."</p>

  <p class="normal">The others also looked. Trotting toward them was a pack of big ugly creatures larger than Jum. Their heads were somewhat doglike but they had two canines which extended at least a foot below the lower jaw. They were somewhat humpbacked, and their rears sloped downward. The bristly fur was gray and marked with small black crosses. Now and then one gave a peculiar high-pitched cry, half-snarl, half-laughter.</p>

  <p>When they got about a hundred feet from the travelers, they stopped and seemed to go into a conference. In the center of the ring they formed was the biggest and the ugliest one, and they seemed to be addressing their horrid cries at him. By now the strong wind carried their odor to Deyv's party, a stench like rotten flesh mixed with a light odor of skunk and garlic.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana said, "I don't like this at all. Are they actually talking?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I doubt it," Sloosh said. "Their foreheads aren't high enough for that kind of intelligence. It's just a behavior pattern. Which doesn't make them any less dangerous."</p>

  <p class="normal">The plant-man went up to the doorway and looked inside. "The walls are even thinner than those of the <i>tharakorm,</i> but they're opaque. The furniture seems to be glued to the floor. Or perhaps it's just a formed extension of the material, a seamless extrusion design." He bent his knees and leveled his upper torso with the ground. He thrust his huge hands under the cylinder where it met the ground.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv gasped when the giant object lifted up above Sloosh's head.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's no cause for wonder," Sloosh said. "Come here. You can raise it easily."</p>

  <p class="normal">Fearful but afraid to show that he was, Deyv put his hands by the Archkerri's. Sloosh stepped back, leaving him to support it. Deyv cried out because he expected the cylinder to drop. But he had only a little trouble keeping it propped up against the trees. It surely weighed no more than eighty pounds.</p>

  <p class="normal">He let it down and said, "What is it? It's not a House."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not the kind you're used to, anyway."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh looked at the ugly beasts. "They're breaking up now. I think we should take refuge in this artifact."</p>

  <p>The circle had become an extended line, with the leader in front of it. Instead of an immediate advance, as Deyv anticipated, the line spread out to the sides, then the ends began curving in. The predators were not only going to make a frontal attack but also intended to charge on the flanks as well.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed that Deyv and Vana should get at one end of the cylinder and he would take the other.</p>

  <p class="normal">They obeyed, though they wondered what he was up to. Sloosh, having stationed himself below the conical end, shrilled, "Now, you two! Lift up on it and carry it my way!"</p>

  <p class="normal">It would have been easy to do so if the wind hadn't pressed it so strongly against the trees. They had to lift it up and slide it along at the same time. The side of the cylinder was like a big sail.</p>

  <p class="normal">Though occupied with his task, Deyv didn't forget the gray cross-marked beasts. Glances showed him that they had stopped. Their cries were puzzled. The leader had trotted closer to the cylinder, then stopped, his head cocked to one side.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the one tree had been passed, and the other was halfway along the cylinder, Sloosh said, "Put it down! But hang on to it! Otherwise, one of the ends may swing around, and it could roll away!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think I see what he means to do," Deyv muttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana asked, "What?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed, "Now, Deyv! Tell your animals to get inside!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Under other circumstances, Jum and Aejip might have been reluctant to enter the cylinder. The obvious intent of the ugly beasts made them eager to take shelter, however. They dived into the doorway.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "Now, Vana, you get in! Hang on, Deyv!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv struggled to keep his end from swinging around under the wind. Vana darted alongside the cylinder and into its doorway.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now work your way toward the entrance! I'll be doing the same! If one end swings out, run as fast as you can and get inside!"</p>

  <p>Synchronizing their progress step by step, they moved toward each other. Deyv's push against the cylinder wall would not have been as strong as Sloosh's, but the plant-man was trying to push with the same force as Deyv's. Before they were within twenty feet of each other, the cylinder began to swivel out at the end behind Sloosh.</p>

  <p class="normal">By then the pack leader decided it was time to attack. Though no doubt hesitant because of the strangeness of the cylinder, he couldn't stand seeing his prey get away. He howled wolflike sounds and sped toward the doorway. Those behind him also charged, and the flanks broke into a run.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv got inside first, then turned to pull Sloosh in. The Archkerri fell in just as the leader snapped at his hind legs. Vana stepped into the breach and slammed the edge of her tomahawk down across the top of the brute's head. The beast fell back, stunned. Some of those directly behind it leaped over its body and jammed themselves into the doorway. Others began tearing-at the leader. The door started swinging inward. Sloosh reached up and pressed an inset plate inside the doorway.</p>

  <p class="normal">All this action had taken place within a few seconds. Then the cylinder, still turning, also began rolling over. The door closed just in time. And they were off, the wind spinning the cylinder across the plain. Inside, all five were running to keep from being turned over. It didn't help any of them, since the room was square, and they missed their step when they tried to get off the floor to the wall, which became the floor for a few seconds. Then the ceiling became the floor, then the wall, then they were back to the floor again. That it was totally dark inside made the situation worse. Deyv fell through the door into the next room and slammed against a wall so hard that he was stunned.</p>

  <p class="normal">A moment later, Jum, yelping, rammed into him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was beaten, bruised, and shaken up worse than when he had been thrown off the <i>tharakorm.</i></p>

  <p>The nightmare finally ended, as all nightmares do. The cylinder stopped with a crash, and its occupants lay wherever they had fallen. There were groans and moans and whimperings. Deyv got up and groped to the doorway, the bottom of which was at chest-level. He hoisted himself through it into the first room. At least, he hoped it was the room with the door to the outside. In his confusion, he might have gotten into the room which led to the interior.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the noise, though, he was sure he was in the right place. He checked everybody out. Nobody was incapable of responding, but all were complaining of numerous pains.</p>

  <p class="normal">His hands found the doorway, and a moment later he pressed the inset plate. Light flooded in as the door opened. It was at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Righting the cylinder was easy, however, as soon as they shifted their weight properly. Then all got out and were glad to do so.</p>

  <p class="normal">The cylinder had stopped by the trees at the edge of the plain. Far off was the pack of gray cross-marked brutes. They were heading after some horned animal.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Something happened there while we were rolling along," Sloosh said. "Did you press any other plates?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv looked inside. The furniture was gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh went back in but came back out in a few minutes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where the furniture was, there are now a few places almost imperceptibly thicker than the floor," he said. "The furniture just folded up. But what caused it to do that?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said he had no idea, which, of course, Sloosh knew. He'd survived the ordeal and wanted nothing more to do with the cause of it. Even if he was as curious as the Archkerri, he didn't have the knowledge to dare experiment.</p>

  <p>Sloosh insisted they make a bunch of torches from rushes, which they soaked with flammable sap. After eating, they set out—in, rather—to explore the cylinder's interior. It wasn't easy even to walk around in it. Because of its extreme lightness, it tended to roll when they started up the steps to the upper level. They retreated, made some crude wooden shovels, and then piled dirt along the bottom. They also lugged in a big pile of heavy stones to place on the bottom floor. Since stones were scarce in the area, a long time was spent in search of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">By then it was past sleep-time. Despite the plant-man's protests, they bedded down. Whatever else it was good for, the cylinder did make a perfect protection from the rain. The door couldn't be shut entirely because they would soon exhaust the oxygen supply. With the animals stationed just behind the opening, they could sleep in relative safety, especially after they erected a barricade of thorn bushes across it.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they did begin their investigation, Vana and Deyv held the torches for Sloosh. It was tedious work for them and a little spooky. The lack of good air circulation drove them outside from time to time. Sloosh was hot on the scent, though, and he wasn't to be stopped by anything.</p>

  <p class="normal">Most of the rooms were empty. The plant-man pointed out the very thin thickenings, which he said were collapsed furniture or devices. He ran his fingers along the walls and ceilings, tracing thin lines throughout the cylinder.</p>

  <p class="normal">"These must be strips through which power was applied. So, let's track down the power supply."</p>

  <p class="normal">They found it in the central portion. It was a cube about six inches wide. From one side of it protruded a long thin rod.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think it can be pushed in," Sloosh said. "But I won't do that. No telling what might happen. I wish I knew what fuel is used. There has to be some left, even after this long time. Otherwise, the door wouldn't have opened."</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, they entered the nose of the cylinder. This contained two chairs and a number of square very thin plates on a curve in front of the chairs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh studied the room for a while.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This has to be a vehicle. Probably to fly through the air. It's even possible it traveled through space.</p>

  <p class="normal">Those plates would be viewscreens of some sort. They indicated flight data and who knows what else?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh did some tracing of the strips. Finally, he stopped at a cluster of thumbprint-size plates. He reached out a finger to one, hesitated, then pressed. The humans jumped back, alarmed, as the chairs and the plates before them shrank, then folded up.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Hmm! All this collapsing!" Sloosh said. "Could it be that. . ."</p>

  <p class="normal">He stopped his buzzes and closed his eyes. Deyv looked at Vana and rolled his eyes. She coughed from the dark fumes of the torches.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh led them out of the room and back to the power cube. He looked at it for a while, then said, "Let's get all the rocks out of here."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why?" Deyv asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No time to waste breath now. I'll tell you why later. If I'm right, if it'll be obvious why I want the stones out. By the way, pick up all the torches you dropped and clean the sap off the floors. I don't want anything in here that wasn't here when we entered."</p>

  <p class="normal">By sleep-time, the rocks were gone, and with them any trace of the travelers. Slosh told Deyv and Vana to stand back from the cylinder, and he went inside. Deyv had expected, for some reason, that Sloosh would go to the upper deck where the cube was. How he was going to do that without tipping the "vehicle" over, Deyv didn’t know. However, Sloosh went only just past the doorway, reached up above it to press something, and then came out, rather quickly for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Maybe we should get even farther away," he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Except for the plant-man, no one knew what to expect. Deyv had some fantasies about it, but what happened wasn't one of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly, the cylinder collapsed, then began to fold up. The two sides straightened up, forming a flat oval. Then a seam appeared along the middle, and it folded, folded, folded.</p>

  <p class="normal">When this process had ceased, the cylinder had become a cube with a thin rod sticking out by an inch.</p>

  <p class="normal">The rod was the same one Deyv had seen projecting from the power supply. The cube was almost three feet across.</p>

  <p class="normal">Though Sloosh's face couldn't show expression, his delight was obvious. He danced around like a drunken elephant, his fingers snapping, his beak buzzing nonsense. When he regained his usual demeanor, he went to the cube and pulled on the rod. They cylinder started to unfold, but after a few seconds he pushed the rod in. It folded once more.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of all the ancients' inventions, this must have been the most wondrous!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is indeed a great and awesome magic," Deyv said. "But what will we do with it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"For the time being, we'll make straps, a saddle, and a girth so I can carry it on my back," Sloosh said. "At sleep-time, we'll use it for protection. Ifs also useful as a refuge in times of danger. I shouldn't have to explain that to you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv reddened. "I know all that. I was just wondering if perhaps . . . well, maybe if it's supposed to fly, we could fly it. And then we could easily find the Yawtl."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A good idea but most impracticable. Perhaps. In the meantime ..."</p>
