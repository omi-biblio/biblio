  <h1>40</h1>

  <p class="normal">THE pall cast by The Dark Beast was not quite at its heaviest when Phemropit and its riders came around the shoulder of the mountain. Below them was a valley. Two valleys, actually, for there was a smaller one in the center of the large one. Out of the inkiness of the former rose The House of the Flying Figures. It was a vague bulk, an intimation of vastness from which soared a dimly lit column or tower. Its upper part was brighter, nimbused by the horizon light flowing through a notch in the mountain range opposite.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were silent for a while, staring through the darkness, trying to put a shape to the structure below the column. The wind had died; not a sound was to be heard. Ever since they had crossed the boundary of The Dead Place, the only noise had been that which they had made or, sometimes, the wind's sobbing or shrilling through peculiar rock formations or the thunder and lightning of storms and the splash of rain. Other than themselves, they'd not seen a living creature—no plants, no insects, no birds, no beasts. Even the stones looked lifeless compared to those outside this land. Somehow, they gave the impression that something had been drained, or sucked, from their stony essence.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet, a sick thing had to be still living. They often came across a small rock, or a large boulder, or a stratum in a mountainside that appeared to be infected. From irregularly shaped patches on these slowly oozed a foul-smelling liquid, cloudy, irresistibly analogous to pus. They had scraped at the dripping patches, thinking that they must be lichen of some sort and thus The Dead Place was not entirely dead. But they got only particles of stone which were, for some reason, darker than the main body of the rock.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, after a long journey made circuitous because there were so many steeps up which Phemropit could not climb, so many passes to find, they were almost to their goal.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana shivered and broke the terrible silence. "I wish we'd stayed on the highway toward home, Deyv."</p>

  <p class="normal">He did, too, but he only said, "This is the coldest place I've ever been."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob flowed down off Phemropit's back and signaled that it should start the descent. After a while the going became so steep that the others also got off. They stayed behind Phemropit so that if it started sliding, they wouldn't be crushed by it. By sleep-time, however, they had reached the floor of the valley without mishap.</p>

  <p class="normal">Just as they did, they were startled by a great noise, a booming metallic note like that which the giant bronze gong in The Shemibob's castle gave when struck by a hammer. Its echoes rang around the valley. They shivered and clutched their hearts.</p>

  <p class="normal">When all was silent again, except for their heavy breathing and the pulse of blood in their ears, Sloosh spoke. His buzzing seemed almost sacrilegious; there was something in the place that might resent it. Or so it seemed to Deyv at the moment. A thing, he was convinced, <i>brooded</i> here and did not want interruption.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "I wonder if that could be an alarm of some sort? Perhaps there are detectors here, and when we entered their field, they set off this, warning signal."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Warning whom?" Deyv whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">The baby began crying then. Vana tried to hush him up, but he would not quit until she had given him her breast. Deyv started to ask if they should bed down or push on. Another vast note rang through the valley, and its echoes raced around the mountains. The baby quit feeding to scream. Why it had not been frightened when the first note sounded, no one knew. Perhaps it had been too scared to voice its fear. Or perhaps it had been only half-awakened.</p>

  <p class="normal">The echoes died; Thrush continued to yell. Vana petted him and said soothing words and finally got him to drink again. Shortly after the silence came again, it was shattered by another metallic roar.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob said, "I counted twenty-one seconds between the sounds."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl said, "So what?" But when the fourth bellow was followed by the fifth, he said, "You're right."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was, by unanimous agreement, no use in going toward The House while the terrible noise continued. They expanded the cube and all but the plant-man and the snake-centaur got inside and closed the door. These two said they would stand guard until they could stand the noise no longer. Those inside could hear nothing with the door shut, so they managed after a long while to get to sleep. Deyv did awake a number of times, startled by that brazen thunder. But he had only dreamed it.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was awakened after a too-short sleep when the door was opened. Sloosh stuck his head in and said, "The noise has stopped."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv asked, "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "What?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He was deaf, and so was The Shemibob. But their loss of hearing was only temporary, and it had not been complete. They had been able to detect all vibrations, though they'd been very feeble at the end.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But if they'd gone on much longer, we'd have had a permanent injury," The Shemibob said. "I counted one thousand and fifty strokes with twenty-one seconds between each."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no use asking the meaning of this. Perhaps there was none. They wouldn't know until they got to The House, and probably not even then. All Deyv was sure of was that he was very uneasy in this place, where it was either too silent or too noisy.</p>

  <p class="normal">The baby was fussy and didn't want his milk. Vana said that she'd been so upset that her milk had probably soured. The Shemibob took a bottle from her bag and from it produced a tiny pill. She told Vana that she should get the baby to swallow it. He would then calm down, probably sleep much, but the drug wouldn't harm him. After some hesitation, Vana took the pill. Thrush spit it out several times before accepting it. Vana then asked if she could have one. The Shemibob refused, saying that Vana wasn't an infant, though she sometimes acted like one. This made Vana so angry that she lost her tiredness and regained her courage.</p>

  <p class="normal">The vessel was folded up and tied onto Sloosh's back. They ate a little—no one felt hungry—and they started across the dark hushed valley. Phemropit's fanlight lit their way; the only sound was the striking of its treads against the loose rocks. The House loomed larger and larger, and after a while they had descended into the small valley and were beside it Phemropit stopped. Before them was a window three times as tall as Deyv and ten times as wide. The walls disappeared on both sides of the window into the darkness.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob took a cylinder from her bag. Its end shot out a bright light through the transparent material of the window. They pressed close to it to look within. But all they could see was a floor many inches thick with dust.</p>

  <p class="normal">The window was smooth and cool, and so was The House around it. The material of which both were made was very hard. After some discussion they agreed that they might as well test the material. If they made so much noise that they attracted the tenant of The House—if there was one—they were not necessarily making a mistake. He or she or it—Deyv hated the ominous sound of that <i>it—</i>probably knew they were here. If it didn't, it would find out sooner or later, so why not sooner?</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv thought of several reasons why, but he knew they wouldn't dissuade The Shemibob and Sloosh.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh hammered on the window and the wall with the great metal axe. He made neither dent nor scratch.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob said, "We can look for a door or we can try Phemropit's cutting ray. It might be more polite, and politic, if we try a door."</p>

  <p class="normal">They agreed that that would be best. First, though, Vana insisted that the vessel be expanded and attached to Phemropit's back. She would put the baby in it and thus be unhampered by him if fast action was needed. The baby would be safer there, too.</p>

  <p class="normal">They did that, and then they started around The House. This took a very long time, during which they counted one thousand and fifty windows before they got to the one from which they'd started. Sloosh had made a small cairn of rocks to mark this.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The same number of windows as the number of strokes," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh's reply to this was inevitable. "Must you always point out the obvious?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv forbore to mention that they'd found no doors. Or, at least, anything that looked like one.</p>

  <p class="normal">None of the windows showed anything but darkness and dust. If there were walls beyond, they were too far for The Shemibob's or Phemropit's lights to penetrate.</p>

  <p class="normal">They went into the vessel to eat. It seemed very cozy there, warm and well lighted, a place to stay for a long time. The baby had awakened and was making small whimperings. Vana nursed him while they talked about what to do next The Yawtl and the humans, except for Feersh, were all for giving up and getting out of this dreary spooky land at once. The witch was logical about the situation, saying that there was no sense in coming this far just to give up.</p>

  <p class="normal">The three dissenters looked at each other, their thoughts evident. Logic might get them killed; emotion was rational in this situation.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This House has been here for a long time," The Shemibob said. "It was here when I came to Earth. Sloosh, do you know when it was built?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. But I do know when it emerged from the ground. At least, I presume it did. That would be when The Dead Place first came into existence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why didn't you say something about this before?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You didn't ask me, and I never-thought the time was relevant for bringing the subject up. Now it is."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob was more than irritated. Deyv had to grin. So, it wasn't only lowly humans who found the Archkerri maddening.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Well, when was it?" The Shemibob asked. Under her silvery skin was a bright pink glow.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You understand that the plants from which I get my data have no sense of time," he said complacently. "It's up to the operator of the prism to work out the chronology from the nature of the data and from various referents and comparisons. Also, for the plants to record something, they have to be where they can <i>see</i> and <i>hear</i> it. In this case, they didn't record when The House was built. Therefore, they were not present when it was.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They first recorded its existence at the beginning of the civilization preceding the last two. This was when The House rose along with a part of a sea-bottom. I assume that all three civilizations knew of it, but their records have been lost. Even the traditions about it vanished among the humans and other sentients.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Actually, the plants didn't directly record The House. They recorded the existence of The Dead Place. They must also have recorded the speech of the civilized peoples when these spoke about The House and The Dead Place in the presence of plants. But that does us Archkerri no good, since we don't know how to interpret any of the languages used.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The origin of The House and its purpose are mysteries. It's possible that the three civilizations managed to decode the flying figures. But I wouldn't know what they read—if anything. In any event, it's obvious that they never managed to get into The House."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If the ancients, with all their wisdom and powers, couldn't read the message "of the flying figures, then we surely won't be able to," the Yawtl said. "And if they couldn't get into The House, how can we? Also, O Shemibob, you surely have had a chance to study the figures during your long, long life? If you don't know what the figures mean after all that time, how—?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Little thief," she said, "there may be a key to the code in The House. If we can't get into The House, then perhaps we can see something through a window which will enlighten us. In any event, we will act as if we will be successful."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What about you, Archkerri?" Deyv asked. "I know you take your time getting around to investigating certain things. But you've known for a long, long time about this place. Why—?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"At least fifty expeditions came here. None ever returned."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl cried, "Then what are we doing here? Let's get out! Now!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"And you didn't tell us that either!" Vana said disgustedly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's always a first time," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob told Phemropit to use,its cutting ray on the window. The tight beam lanced out and stayed on one spot for a minute. Phemropit turned it off then, saying that it didn't want to use any more energy when doing so was useless. It was right. The window was still whole and unmarred.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I just had a strange thought," Vana said. She was shivering. "Think of when this building was on the bottom of the ocean, in the black and terrible cold of the waters. Did that great gong ever boom out then? Did its vibrations sound along the mud, disturbing only the weird forms that scuttled there? And how many times?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They knew just as much about it as we do," Deyv said. "But they probably had the good sense not to go near it."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl urged that they leave immediately. It was obvious that they couldn't get inside, and he was happy about that. Perhaps whatever had eaten up the nosey Archkerri was sleeping now. But who knew when it might wake up? Especially now, when they were making such an uproar.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob said, "Look!"</p>

  <p class="normal">She pointed upward. They turned to see, against the light in the notch, the first of the flying figures in the sky. After it, in single file, came others, and then the leader was lost in the darkness. Phemropit, at The Shemibob's request, backed up until it came to a slope. It went down this until it was at an angle from which its fan-light fell upon the top of the column. Dimly seen, the first of the figures, a giant <i>#</i>, dipped down, shrinking swiftly, and was swallowed. Those behind it also went into the opening. This couldn't be seen by the watchers, but the top of the black column had to be open.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Unless," Sloosh said, "the figures just evaporate there."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Hardly likely," The Shemibob said. "But then this is not a likely phenomenon."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If they can get in, we can," the plant-man said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"When did we start to grow wings?" the Yawtl growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">His comment was not far off the mark The walls went straight up for two hundred feet and then curved out to make a wide overhang. The roof was a squat pyramid, an estimated one hundred feet high. From its tip the column rose for perhaps four hundred feet. It seemed to be about fifty feet in diameter.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There wouldn't be an opening in it, anyway," Sloosh said. "The rain and dust would get in."</p>

  <p class="normal">They talked for a long time but could think of no way to enter. Nevertheless, the Archkerri and The Shemibob did not want to give up. Not yet. After checking the supplies, they estimated that there was enough for the return journey plus seven more sleep-times.</p>

  <p class="normal">The others didn't like the idea of staying in the dismal and frightening place a second longer than necessary. Phemropit's opinion wasn't asked for. It would go along with the majority; one place was as good as another. But then it hadn't heard the mighty clanging.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thunder growled from the direction in which The Dark Beast came. After a while a strong wind arose, and lightning flashed. The wind became a hurricane. Rain, half-frozen, struck them. They went around The House to the side where the wind would be weaker. They huddled inside the vessel and waited for the storm to pass. Finally, they went to sleep, and when they awoke and opened the door, they found that the elements were still raging.</p>

  <p class="normal">Moreover, the small valley in which The House stood was in three feet of water. Heavy cataracts were pouring over the edge of the large valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob got out and struggled against the wind to the front of Phemropit. There she signaled that it should take them out of the small valley. If the water there was getting deeper, Phemropit should go up onto the mountain slope. She came back dripping wet, her porcupinelike hair bending like riverbank reeds after a flood had subsided. She stationed herself by the door, opening it now and then to check on Phemropit's progress. It took a long time to get out of the small valley; the water rose almost as fast as Phemropit did up the slope.</p>

  <p class="normal">The floor of the big valley was by then three feet under the surface of the boiling flood. Before Phemropit reached the foot of the nearest mountain, it and the vessel it bore were underwater. It slogged on ahead, and presently the tilt of the floor showed that it was on a steep incline. After waiting to make sure they were high enough, The Shemibob opened the door. Phemropit's fan-light revealed a broad and wide ledge of rock a few feet ahead. She got out and directed the creature to go under the ledge. Here they were safe from the direct blast of the howling wind, but the rain pouring down the mountainside curtained the ledge. They were under a waterfall which made invisible anything beyond it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Another sleep-time came. They ate sparingly, since they couldn't know how long they'd be stuck there. Suddenly, the wind began to die, and the rain stopped. When the cataract had finally thinned to a number of trickles, they looked down the mountain. The clouds were losing their grim blackness, and some of the bright sky behind The Beast was silhouetting the peaks to the left. They still couldn't see well, so they went back into the vessel. In another sleep-time, though, the clouds were gone, and enough of The Beast had passed for them to see the situation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Far off, the upper part of the roof of The House reared out of the water.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's no place for the water to drain out," Sloosh said. "It'll have to evaporate. Meanwhile—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We can go in the vessel to The House and get on the roof," The Shemibob said. "Maybe there are windows on it."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl and the humans sighed, but they made no useless protests. The Shemibob unglued the vessel from Phemropit's back after it had gone down to the waterline. She took out ten more coils of the very thin and light but very strong rope and glued their ends together. After connecting one end to Phemropit and one to the nose of the vessel, she gave the creature detailed instructions. The door was closed, and the passengers settled down for a long ride.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now and then the door was opened so they could be sure they were going in the right direction. It was also necessary to make sure that there was enough rope to keep them on the surface. When Phemropit got to the floor of the small valley, there was only about a foot extra. But that was enough.</p>

  <p class="normal">The creature, following its instructions correctly, stopped when it was alongside The House. Leaving Feersh with the baby and the animals, they climbed up the steeply sloping roof. Halfway between the edge of the roof and the column were windows as large as those at ground level.</p>

  <p class="normal">They braced themselves around one and looked within it Below, illuminated dimly by The Shemibob's device, was a gigantic room. The walls were bare. The floor was covered with dust, and here and there, on pedestals, were what they at first thought were rough columns of rock.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob said, "No. They were once statues of granite."</p>

  <p class="normal">Nobody said anything.</p>

  <p class="normal">She said, "Don't you realize what that means? Look at them. You can still make out the general shapes. Some were statues of human beings. Others were of bipeds of some kind, and some were of quadrupeds. That one there"—she fixed her light on it—"was a bird. You can see that those projections were once wings."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh started to buzz but changed his mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob spoke with a note of exasperation. "Those were statues carved from granite. But they are <i>eroded.</i> Yet there have been no winds in there. The air, I'm sure, doesn't even move. Or, if it does, very slowly. And I'll wager that there has been no change of temperature or humidity in there since The House was built.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But the hard granite has decayed and has eroded as if it had been subject to eons of exposure to sun, wind, sand, and extremes of heat and cold.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now can you see how <i>old</i> this House is?"</p>

  <p class="normal">They were awe-struck.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob had brought along another device from her bag. She unfolded it into a thing which looked like an egg that had been cut in half and the cut part sealed over with a silvery screen. A tripod folded from the artifact. She put the three legs down against the window with the round end of the egg pointing downward. The discs on the ends of the legs stuck to the transparent material.</p>

  <p class="normal">She turned a little dial on the side. On the flat end</p>

  <p class="normal">of the device a picture appeared. She adjusted the dial,</p>

  <p class="normal">and the objects in the center of the room became large</p>

  <p class="normal">and bright.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a huge block of dark material, the same unchanging stuff of which The House was made. Twelve steps up it led to a large chair, also of the same material. It had a high back and arms covered with designs. Deyv could not see them clearly because of the angle and also because the arms of the being in the chair partly covered them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The man sat stiffly, upright, unmoving, staring straight ahead.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv had a creepy feeling that the man was looking into eternity. Perhaps into infinity.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wore a cap of scarlet edged with white fur. Its long tasseled top lay behind his head against the back of the chair. Under it was a broad round face, red-nosed, red-cheeked, red-lipped. .The thick eyebrows were white, as was the long hair flowing from under the cap.</p>

  <p class="normal">A long and thick white beard fell over a large round paunch to the belt-line. His jacket was scarlet, edged with white fur. His belt was wide and black. His pants were scarlet. His calf-length boots were scarlet with, white fur around the tops. On the third finger of his left hand was a simple gold ring.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It certainly looks lifelike," Sloosh said. "It must be made of the same material as The House, though."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am not sure that it's just a statue," The Shemibob said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv felt like leaving at once. If he'd been alone, he might have. However, if that had been the case, he wouldn't have thought that it might be other than a figure made by the ancients.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why do you say that?" Sloosh asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's no dust on it Also . . ."</p>

  <p class="normal">She swung the device so that they could see the floor' in front of the block. There were footprints in the dust. They led away from and to the block.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let's get away from here!" the Yawtl said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nobody replied, but Deyv wondered if the others felt their skin prickling coldly, too.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob moved the device so that they could see on its screen the thin slab towering behind the block. This bore a gigantic yellow arrow attached at one end to a knob in the center of the slab. In a circle around the arrow were very small characters evenly spaced. These startled Deyv and added to his unease. They were the same figures as those that flew through the sky. They were in the same order if the character at the top was to be the first and those that followed were read toward the right.</p>

  <p class="normal">A little to the left and below the top character was a knob. The point of the arrow rested against the knob.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Aha!" The Shemibob said loudly.</p>

  <p class="normal">A moment later, Sloosh said, "I know what you mean."</p>

  <p class="normal">Dew asked what they were talking about.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The hand and the figures constitute a <i>thrigz,"</i> Sloosh said. "Your language doesn't have a word for it. It's a machine to tell the passage of time."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Be still," the snake-centaur said. "I'm counting."</p>

  <p class="normal">After a long while, she looked up from the screen.</p>

  <p class="normal">"One thousand and fifty characters," she said. "Exactly the number of those that have appeared over the Earth since I've been here and probably long, long before that. Exactly the number of strokes we heard. These, I presume, came from the time-teller."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And the hand has stopped," Sloosh said. "Does that mean that time itself . . . no, that couldn't be."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Earth's time is done," she said. "Practically done, anyway. What is a few hundred or even a few thousand more circlings of The Beast to the passage of time this instrument has registered?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then," Sloosh said, "when the hand has passed from one figure to the next, twenty-one million years have passed?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Approximately."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And this machine strikes each such passage?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I suppose so."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But why? What is all this about?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is the type of question which the humans sometimes have asked you. And you have told them that the questions are unanswerable. Therefore, foolish."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "I am justly reprimanded. My apologies."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We heard the final telling of the time. The flying figures have come home to roost forever." "Until the new universe is formed," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv did not understand this. The Shemibob, however, looked as if she comprehended it too well.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The flying figures," the Yawtl said. "They must have come from someplace in the column. But you'll never be able to open it and see what mechanism makes them, sends them out around the world, pulls them back, shrinks them so they can enter the column. Even if you could, you still wouldn't be able to learn what they mean."</p>

  <p class="normal">He seemed pleased by this. The Shemibob and the Archkerri might be higher beings, but they too could be mystified. In the presence of this eons-old enigma, they were as helpless as he.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob said, "Some of the figures are letters which humans used in their writing from the beginning. That X, that T, that H, and that O, and others have always been used here. They are simple, naturally formed figures, so natural that they've been used on other worlds, including my native planet.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But many of the characters are unfamiliar to me. And I believe they were unfamiliar to the great civilizations which saw them floating above in the sky when the Earth rotated more swiftly on its axis. They probably had more success than I've had in interpreting the message. It must be a message, a spelling out of Earth's doom and, perhaps, the means for escaping the doom."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "Perhaps. It would have been better if, instead of letters of some alphabet, the sender of the message had used moving pictures. These could have been understood by anyone."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That does seem the logical thing to do," she said. "Perhaps the figures were designed as directions to The House. Anybody could follow them to it. In which case, we should be able to see something that will enlighten us."</p>

  <p class="normal">From somewhere in Deyv's mind a thought seeped out like water that had forced its way up through rock.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now I know what you meant when you said that the figures won't go out again until a new universe is formed!" he said. "But ... if the House and its occupant are waiting until then, wouldn't they—perhaps— have come from an older universe to this one? I mean, couldn't they have survived the death of the universe that existed before ours? They passed unscathed through the fall of all matter and the formation of the giant fireball and its explosion and the formation of this universe? The House is made of something which will outlast the deaths of many worlds!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh patted Deyv's shoulder. "Very good. You are learning."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What nonsense," Hoozisst said. "Why would anyone stay in The House while the Earth was a good place to live in? Surelv, that man, if he is a man and not just a statue, would leave The House to enjoy life. What sense is there in sitting frozen on that chair and only rousing, and that not often, to look out the window?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We don't know that he does stay in The House," The Shemibob said. "Of course, that would imply a longevity that makes even mine look as short as a mayfly's existence."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl snickered.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Besides, there is no guarantee that The House would be drawn to a planet," Sloosh said. "It might float through space until it falls with all other matter toward a common point."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perhaps," The Shemibob said, "it makes no difference to the tenant."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The point is," Hoozisst said, "is there anything there that will tell us what the flying figures mean?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob sighed and said, "No."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then we've wasted our time and put ourselves in danger for nothing."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're too practical, too unimaginative," Sloosh said. "This universe wasn't created for the likes of you."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl lifted one lip to show some sharp teeth, but he said nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv looked from the screen into the sombre depths below the window. Was the statue really a human being who woke up now and then after an unimaginably long nap? Who then walked through a hall and into a room that held a window and looked through it to see how the world had changed? And then he walked back to the throne and became a statue again?</p>

  <p class="normal">What woke him up and what put him to sleep again, that is, turned him back into a stuff that nothing could destroy?</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv shook his head, and he shivered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "I wonder why the hand on the <i>thrigz</i> is yellow and the figures are blue?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob gave her flapping laugh. "What is the color of time?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed laughter. "I don't know. What is the angle of a thought?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Or the temperature of love?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Or the rate of acceleration of instinct?"</p>

  <p class="normal">''Is a dead ray of light gray or blue?"</p>

  <p class="normal">They burst out laughing again. This was cut off by a cry from the Yawtl. "His finger moved!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Startled, all looked at the screen.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a while, Deyv said, "I think I see it move, too." He wanted desperately to get down off the roof and into the vessel.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Shemibob said, "No, it didn't. You imagined it. So did Hoozisst."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's like watching a corpse and thinking you see its chest rise and fall," Vana said. She didn't sound too certain, however.</p>

  <p class="normal">They kept on looking at the finger with the gold band. There wasn't a sound. It seemed as if the whole world had died.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, The Shemibob said, "We have less time than I thought. We should go now."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv did not recall ever having heard words that made him as happy.</p>
