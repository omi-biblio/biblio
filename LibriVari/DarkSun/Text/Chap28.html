  <h1>28</h1>

  <p class="normal">DEYV said, "Vana, my grandmother told me that we're lost. We don't have the slightest idea how to get to the cave that holds our soul eggs. We'll never find them." Vana took his story as seriously as lie did. Her tribe also talked to the dead in its dreams, though usually it was the grandfather who delivered the messages for the gods.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Never?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Never. But she said that we could make our own eggs with The Shemibob's help."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know," she said. "I'm not saying that some demon took your grandmother's semblance and gave you a false message. But I would like to confer with my great-grandfather, since my grandfather is still alive. He has sometimes come to me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said angrily, "And how will you know that the demon wasn't taking the semblance of your greatgrandfather?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Oh, no. My demons are not yours. Yours could not appear to me. Besides, when my great-grandfather comes, he makes a secret sign. I know by that that he is indeed what he appears to be."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sure!" Deyv said. "But what if he'd been a demon when he first came to you, and it was then that he arranged the secret sign with you. That would mean that the demon had always been the one who talked to you. And if your great-grandfather does come, he won't know the sign. And you'll think he's the demon!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh had to pull Vana from Deyv, whom she'd knocked to the ground. He held her up in the air while she. kicked and writhed and screamed insults. Deyv got up, holding his throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">"She's crazy! I was only being logical!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The plant-man said, "I've observed that when a human is dealing with another, he's usually <i>logical</i> only if he's advancing his self-interests or has a desire to hurt or put down the other. Is this one of those situations?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of course not!" Deyv cried. "I was just trying to point out something to her! Why'd she go mad?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Both of you have mixed attitudes toward the other," the Archkerri said. "I don't really have enough data about humans to analyze what motivates them. Rather, I should say, I don't know enough about you two, since individuals vary so much, to explain what your relationship is. I can tell you what it should be, but neither of you would care to listen. I mean, you'd listen, but your ears would be tuned to different vibrations from those I'd be emitting. Perhaps I should start over. What I mean—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was just trying to get at the truth," Deyv said. "I had no desire to hurt her."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not that you are aware of. But I've observed that humans often don't know how their own psyches operate. Indeed, there seems to be more energy used in <i>not</i> knowing than in knowing. Why this is, after an unimaginable number of—"</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv walked away. When he was some distance from the two, he saw Sloosh let Vana down. She ran into the jungle and didn't come back until a long time after. It wasn't until after the next sleep-time that she would address him, and she did so only in matters that concerned maintenance of the camp.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was polite but stiff. So was Vana, though he couldn't figure out why she should be so, since the offense was wholly hers. But after some reflection, he saw that perhaps he had spoken too frankly. And he had to admit that if he had been she, he'd have been offended. Still, his observations <i>had</i> been logically based. When dealing with demons, you couldn't be too careful.</p>

  <p class="normal">He shrugged. He seemed to be doing a lot of that lately, and he thought, If she wants to go back on that hopeless search, let her do it. Alone. She might want to take Aejip with her for protection and companionship, but I won't allow it. The cat is mine. I've just loaned her to Vana.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the next sleep-time, Vana went hunting with Aejip. She returned with a young pig, a tusker, and a bagful of delicious beetle eggs. She gave these to the two slaves to prepare, then walked up to Deyv.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I tried to summon my great-grandfather before I went to sleep," she said. "But he didn't come. So, while hunting, I did some thinking, I sat for a while under a puh tree and breathed in the perfume of its fruit. As you know, it helps one to think true thoughts. You didn't know? Well, different tribes have different wisdoms.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Anyway, it came to me that my great-grandfather didn't visit me because he didn't think it was necessary. I could solve my problem by myself. Which I did. I decided that what you said, what your grandmother told you, was the right path. So . . . I'm going on with you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv surprised both of them by embracing her tightly. But he stepped back quickly.</p>

  <p class="normal">She stared at him for a moment, then said, "You're happy! You would've missed me!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We've been together a long time, and you are a good companion, even if you're grouchy sometimes. Too touchy, I mean. But then I'd miss—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The dog? The cat?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv gestured. "Oh, you know."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. I don't."</p>

  <p class="normal">Her shoulders stiff, she turned and walked off. Not before he'd seen the tears, though.</p>

  <p class="normal">He felt a tightening in his chest, and he had to swallow. He hadn't meant to hurt her again. But she was, after all, a woman without an egg. She hadn't felt like one when he had squeezed her; her flesh was no different from that of a woman with a soul. And, he reminded himself, he, too, was eggless. In this situation, logic had no force.</p>

  <p class="normal">Needing to do something, anything at all to keep from thinking about her, he went to Sloosh. The plant-man and the Yawtl were examining the Emerald of Anticipation. Deyv interrupted their discussion.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vana and I are going on with you."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl burst into barking laughter. Sloosh buzzed his equivalent of mirth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Hoozisst was showing me how the stone operates, though so far he can use it only for simple situations. It takes a long time to get complete mastery of it. However, by coincidence, we were just asking it what the decision of you two would be. And here you come along and confirm what it showed."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Emerald's interior was glowing with writhing designs of many colors. They looked like visual gibberish to Deyv, though apparently they did make sense. He thought it was an amusing toy but that was about all it was. Certainly, it hadn't helped Feersh much.</p>

  <p class="normal">"According to the witch, there are a thousand times a thousand such emeralds growing in The Shining House of Countless Chambers," the Yawtl said. "And there are a thousand times that many different types of stones, each type of which has its own powers. If I could chip off one of each, I'd be the most powerful witch in the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'd need a chisel made of the metal of the ancients," Sloosh said. "Feersh stole one before she fled, which is why she was able to cut one stone off. But she was too fearful of The Shemibob to take the time to remove more."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All that's fine," Deyv said. "Only ... I thought that maybe you'd be pleased that we're going with you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do you expect?" Hoozisst said. "That we'd jump with joy?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I <i>am</i> pleased," the plant-man said. "I derive a certain amount of emotional satisfaction from your company and have found you most energetic and agreeably aggressive in the dangerous situations we've encountered."</p>

  <p class="normal">" 'Emotional satisfaction'?" Deyv said sarcastically. "I thought you Archkerri were all intellect, unhampered, as you might say, by emotion."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nonsense. Any creature with a nervous system experiences emotions. These may be only fear or anger at the lowest level. As the systems get more complex, the number of emotions increases and so does the complexity, the interrelationships, the subtlety.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, it would be impossible, as far as I know, for a sapient to evolve without emotion. Sentiency involves more than just a logical brain. Besides, there are different kinds of logic. Just as there are different kinds of emotions. We Archkerri share some of your emotions but have some you lack. That's all. Except that we are able to use our intellect somewhat better than you humans do. If you weren't doomed to perish with this universe, and you may not be, you might evolve into a higher creature. By 'higher,' I mean a people who would be neither self-destructive nor other-destructive.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Here we are, here you are, rather, you humans. In the unimaginable time you've been on Earth, you've changed your physical form very little. There was no evolutionary need for it, since you are generalized and so very fit for survival. Like the ant, cockroach, pig, and rat. You have had, however, a vastly more complex brain structure.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yet, though you've developed many great civilizations, you haven't been able to make yourself thoroughly cooperative or free yourself of the diseases of body and mind. It's true that you've conquered many, but new ones come to replace them. You're incapable of inventing a panacea for body and mind; you're still selfish, greedy, short-sighted, and illogical outside of a few fields of thought, and sometimes too emotional in those.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So here you are near the end of the world, savages, beings who, given the time, would build up a great civilization again. You don't have the time, and the long, long story, the many-eons tale of humankind, will end. For what reason? I don't know. The universe, looked at logically, is, despite all its intricate order and irresistible physical principles, senseless.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Or is it? Perhaps it's been made for emotional satisfaction, not intellectual, though the two aren't always separate. The question is: for whose?</p>

  <p class="normal">"But if it is emotional satisfaction that is the basis of this universe, the prime reason for the existence of sentients, not immortality, then perhaps you humans are superior to us Archkerri. I shudder at the idea, but I consider it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What I know, or think I know, is that the existence of questions implies answers. Otherwise, we have an unbalanced equation—if there can be such a contradictory thing—and that doesn't appeal to my scientific mind. But then perhaps the universe is one cosmic unbalanced equation. It would be the only one; all lesser equations can be balanced. Perhaps it is the very lack of balance that creates space-matter.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do I know what I'm talking about? Perhaps. I do know that this type of thinking gives me a brain-ache. But I get emotional satisfaction from this pain."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl had walked away during this discourse. Deyv was fascinated, but he was glad when Sloosh turned to a more mundane matter. Which now was what they'd take to get to the land of The Shemibob. After a conference which even the slaves attended, though they had no voice in the decision, the shoreline was chosen. It would be the longest way around, but they could get lost too easily in the vast jungles. Also, it was much easier walking on the beach.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Eventually, following it, we'll get to the far end of the land," Sloosh said. "Then we can rum back into it. The Shemibob lives somewhat inland from the ocean. But we will come to a place on the beach where The Jeweled Wasteland grows. All we have to do is to enter it there. Feersh the Blind will show us—rather, tell us—where the House of The Shemibob is."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, I can't do that!" the witch shrilled. "I fled from her House to the opposite end. I wouldn't know the path from where we'll enter. Moreover, I'm not sure that I'd recognize now the path I took. It was many many sleep-times since I ran with brain-freezing terror at my heels. Besides, The Wasteland has been growing since then. It's not only spread outward, it's grown upward. The landmarks which I only vaguely remember are probably covered over now."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh's reply to this was, "I wonder why the stones are growing out of control?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Thoroughly rested, they packed up and set out. By then The Beast had come around again and slid by half of the sky. Ten sleep-times passed without much incident. They saw during the eleventh a village on the beach and detoured into the jungle. On the twentieth they were warned by Deyv, who was the scout, that a House was ahead. It lay on its side, its base sticking from the jungle onto the sand. Deyv had run into the jungle and gotten close to it to spy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They are not human," he said. "They're even stranger-looking than you, Hqozisst."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm not strange-looking," Hoozisst growled. "It's you humans who look so peculiar."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh heard Deyv's description of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They're Tsimmanbul," Sloosh said. "I've met some tribes that were friendly; some that were downright hostile. We'd better go around these. No use taking chances."</p>

  <p class="normal">The next inhabited place was a village of bamboo huts, round and with conical grass-thatched roofs, surrounded by a log stockade. Like the previous Tsimmanbul, they seemed to be engaged chiefly in fishing. This was all to the good, since it meant that the chances of encountering their hunters in the jungle were less. However, going around the fourth village, they were almost surprised by four warriors carrying a deer suspended from two poles. They dived into the bush and waited until the hunters were long gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shortest of the Tsimmanbul was at least six feet six inches tall. Their skin was hairless and a dark slate-gray color with white bands running from below their armpits to halfway down their legs. In form, the bodies were human enough, though their long toes were webbed. The heads were about a third larger than those of a human of the same height, and they were beastish. Deyv thought they looked both doglike and fishlike, yet their faces were intelligent and expressive. The forehead looked as if it covered a very large brain. The mouths were very wide, curving around almost to the quite humanlike ears. These looked small but only because the huge heads dwarfed them.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were certainly exotic-appearing. What made Deyv's neck hairs' seem to bristle, though he'd seen Tsimmanbul before, were the tops of their smooth glossy gray heads. Fat and muscle bunched up on the skin, and there were openings at the peaks. These moved like lips, as if they were breathing through them. Sloosh had told him that they were air-entrances, although once they had been blowholes.</p>

  <p class="normal">They talked with their mouths, however, in a series of modulated pipings. Sharp teeth flashed whitely in the dark faces; their gums and tongues were a fish-belly white.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They, too, had a mighty civilization once, though it was mainly confined to the ocean," Sloosh said. "Their cities rose on pylons from the bottom or floated on the surface. At that time, they lived in peace with the humans. But, after a catastrophe, they reverted to savagery."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Dark Beast made its circular patrol of the Earth unwearyingly. The group that walked along the ocean-shore below it was not so, untiring. They stopped frequently and rested. Other times they had to flee long distances or hide to escape humans, Yawtl, Tsimmanbul, hordes of beetles or ants, and on one river a horde of poisonous serpents that poured from they knew not where to they knew not where.</p>

  <p class="normal">Earthquakes of varying intensities shook, rocked, and threw them. The Earth opened up before and behind them, and twice almost below them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Storms slammed down giant trees that had endured for thousands of sleep-times; rains knocked them down before they could get into the expanded vessel; lightning struck so close it knocked the Yawtl senseless. Deyv said, however, that that was no new condition for Hoozisst.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once, a very cold wind came, the first Deyv had felt, though there was said to have been a terrible one shortly before he was born. With it came another new phenomenon, hail. The large hard ice balls bruised them after tearing through the leaves overhead and might have killed them if they hadn't taken refuge in the vessel.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were also many times when the sandy or, rocky beach ran out, and they had to climb the cliffs abutting on the waters.</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh's family and the two slaves became as tough as the others, though Jeydee continued to whine and complain. Finally, Deyv got so tired of it that he told them they'd have to carry the cube between them unless they quit complaining. They didn't stop, but they confined their remarks to their own language. Since Deyv didn't understand it, it didn't bother him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh estimated that they had traveled four thousand miles along the shore. This curved so much, however, that they were still perhaps three thousand miles from the land of The Shemibob. The distance didn't utterly dishearten them. They had no keen sense of time.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the meantime, Deyv had sought relief from his ever-increasing tension by approaching the female slave, Tishdom. To his utter humiliation and abysmal frustration, she refused him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, I will talk to you and eat with you, but I won't go into the bushes with you. I'd like to, if circumstances were different, even if you are a savage. But I can't, I just can't. You don't have a soul egg."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv felt like hitting her.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What nonsense is this? You've been bedded by Feersh and her children. They don't have eggs!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was their slave and had to do what they wished. I loathed every moment of it—well, almost every moment. Now I can tell them to go suck a <i>sheekrook."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv stomped off, angry yet feeling as if he were something unclean. Which he was.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tishdom must have told Vana about the conversation. She came to Deyv. Instead of the jeers he'd expected, she seemed sorry for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now you know how I felt when you didn't ask me. And how I felt when Shlip rejected me. A slave!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh, hearing of this matter, said, "I'm glad I'm not a human. But then I couldn't be. The I of me is unique. It is the singular body which forms the singular identity, the psyche. Flesh is the origin and shaper of that entity which you call the soul. Or, in my case, flesh and vegetable."</p>

  <p class="normal">The bright sky and The Beast leisurely chased each other as if they had eternity to run. The witch and her people learned Sloosh's language.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, shortly after breakfast, as they were going down a jungle path to avoid a settlement, what they'd feared for so long happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had no warning, no growls from the cat or dog, no evidence of the trap. The leafy ceiling seemed to fall in on them, and they were covered with a great heavy net entangled with foliage. They struggled until the leaves were picked off by a dozen grinning Tsimmanbul.</p>
