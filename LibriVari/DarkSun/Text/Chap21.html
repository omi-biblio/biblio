  <h1>21</h1>

  <p class="normal">VANA said that they should rest, perhaps sleep, while the fires kept Feersh from attacking. They could take turns on guard duty.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No," Deyv said. "I realize we've been through an exhausting ordeal. I'm shaking, I'm so fatigued. But we can't allow them any breathing space. There's no telling what ancient devices she might have aboard but which she can't get to yet. Besides, she's vindictive enough to drop our soul eggs over the side. We'd never find them, and all this would have been in vain."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh started to buzz. Deyv kept on talking.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Another thing. She may have more than one plank. She could send her slaves and children over it to take us by surprise. For all we know, she may be doing it now or may have already done it. But I'm hoping that if she does have one, she hasn't thought about using it. Or maybe she lacks the nerve to try it; though, from that one glimpse of her face, I'd bet she lacks fear, whatever else she lacks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So, I say we put our planks across and storm her <i>tharakorm.</i> Now! Before she gets over the shock of seeing her <i>khratikl</i> fail!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Excellent!" Sloosh buzzed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana said, "You're right. But I'm so tired. I don't know if I can even lift my arm any more."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're as tough as the rest of us," Deyv said. "If we can do it, you can."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Besides, we've eaten," the Yawtl said. "We'll begin feeling stronger shortly."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's a point at which food doesn't help," she said. "But I'm not letting you down. Or my tribe."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv understood by this that she meant her tribe was the inferior of no other. She knew she was no longer a member of her people, but she still had hopes of rejoining them. She hadn't given up, though her body was warring with her will at that moment.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was ashamed that he had thought only of dying when his egg had been stolen. She'd not even considered the idea. She'd set out at once on the trail of the thief. Her people didn't look at things the way his did. Was their attitude superior? Considering the way events had gone, they were. If he'd let himself perish in that terrible room in the House, he wouldn't be here now.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly, he was aware they were looking at him. He shook himself, like Jum just coming out of a river, and said, "Then here's what we'll do."</p>

  <p class="normal">After igniting two torches, they went belowdecks and got the plank. They carried it to another room, the window of which was opposite another in the tharakorm occupied by Feersh and brood and slaves. She might be thinking by now of doing the same thing as they were. Just from habit, she might use the same window.</p>

  <p class="normal">The board was just long enough to span the entrances with a few inches extra on each end. Feersh must have had some trouble finding the window across from her, and she must have had great confidence in her ability to estimate distances. But she had probably gone through drills many times. She wasn't one to ignore what might ensure her survival. Not if what Hoozisst said about her was true.</p>

  <p class="normal">She also must have been very strong despite her scrawny physique. Deyv had trouble holding down his end of the plank against the edge of the window when it was almost fully extended. However, he told himself, he <i>was</i> almost exhausted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once the board was on the rim of the window opposite, he started across it. Below was an abyss, the bottom of which he couldn't see and was glad he couldn't. The Yawtl followed. Vana and the two animals were next. Deyv and Hoozisst held the board steady for the Archkerri. Before Sloosh was halfway across, his weight had bent it down so that the few inches within the edge of the window had become less than an inch. Deyv hissed at him and then told him, in a low voice, to go back.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh walked backward and gingerly eased himself, rear first, through the window. Deyv would have liked to call to him to ask what he intended to do next, but he was afraid that his voice would be heard above. The sides of the two <i>tharakorm</i> curved up and joined, forming a canopy. Those above couldn't see him, but there was a slight chance that they might detect a loud sound from the window.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We need him," Deyv muttered, "but we don't have him. So . . ."</p>

  <p class="normal">They left the torches in the room because their light might be seen by those on deck. The corridor was dark, the fires having burned out, though the stench of the fumes and of burned bodies was heavy. Deyv led the way, groping along, until he went up the stairs into the cabin. Light from torches outside the cabin enabled him to distinguish objects in it. The stink of the charred corpse of a slave made him feel like retching.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked softly through the door and looked around the corner. The fires and the torches revealed Feersh, her children, and the slaves behind the cabin. The witch was saying something to them in a low voice. When she'd finished, she put her hand on Jowanarr's shoulder. The daughter turned toward Deyv, who quickly ducked back around the corner.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Get to the other side!" he whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">A moment later, they heard their enemies enter the cabin. Someone was climbing onto the roof. Deyv stepped back from the side of the cabin, where he'd been crouching, and he dared a quick look upward. A slave woman was standing on the roof, her back to him, trying to see through the fire and smoke along the railings.</p>

  <p class="normal">He shot back to the cabin wall and said, "They've left a lookout up there. But where are the others going?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl said, "I think they're going to do what we just did. But in the other direction."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then they have other planks."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Wouldn't doubt it." The Yawtl chuckled.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then they'll see the lights of the torches we left behind!"</p>

  <p class="normal">If they ran to the fore cabin, they might be seen by the sentinel. A scream would alert the witch. There was, however, no time for much consideration of action.</p>

  <p class="normal">Without telling the others what he was going to do, he leaped up, slapped his hands on the edge of the cabin roof, and pulled himself up and over. The woman whirled on hearing him, but he was on his feet and lashing out with his tomahawk. Its edge caught her above the ear, and she crumpled without a sound. He leaped off the roof and ran toward the fore cabin. Those below might hear his feet, but there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him Vana and Hoozissf s feet thudded and Jum's and Aejip's paws slapped the deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were in luck. Coming into the corridor, he saw that Feersh and her party were all looking down the corridor that led straight out from the bottom of the stairs. It looked to him as if she'd sent people down it, and they were waiting for them to return. Ah! Some slaves had gone after a plank.</p>

  <p class="normal">The doorway of the room through which he had entered this <i>tharakorm</i> shed light. It would be feeble if seen by the witch's party, but they must have noticed it. That no one had been sent to investigate, however, showed that they had given the light little thought. Why should they? There were plenty of burned-out torches lying around where the battlers of a short time ago had dropped them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Still, Feersh would have been told of the light. She might decide to have someone investigate when she got near this room. He turned and pressed the others into a room on the other side of the corridor. He got down on all fours and stuck his head around the corner of the doorway. They'd been just in time. Here came a slave running ahead with a torch, two slaves carrying a long plank, and another slave behind them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The man in the lead raced ahead of the others until he came to the room containing the torches. He looked through the doorway and then sped back to report. Deyv couldn't hear what he said, but evidently Feersh wasn't alarmed. She said something, and the two slaves maneuvered the plank through the door of a room about twenty feet beyond the hiders.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv had to withdraw his head. When the light from the group had dimmed somewhat, he looked again. Nobody was in the corridor.</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited, then sped silently down the corridor. Hoping that they would be intent on their business, he dared a glimpse into the room. All were watching the two slaves put the plank across the gap.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he'd told the others what he'd seen, Vana said, "Sloosh will surely see them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know. They didn't see him. Maybe he went back to the top deck. But he must've decided to pull the plank back through the window. Otherwise, they'd have seen it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In which case," Vana said, "he's still at the window. He'd have to stay there so we could get back if we had to run."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not so," Hoozisst said, and he groaned. "You never know what he's thinking. If he happened to recall some philosophical question he'd not solved, he might be digging through it."</p>

  <p class="normal">After telling Vana to post herself by the doorway, Deyv went back to the room he'd first entered. He didn't think that anybody would come out from the other room. They had no reason to fear attack from behind.</p>

  <p class="normal">When in the room, he cautiously looked out the window from a distance and at an angle. They couldn't see him, but he could see them. Two big male slaves in Indian file were carefully walking over the board, their hands out to balance themselves, the right hands grasping spears. They were spaced so that their weight didn't bend the plank too much at one point. One went through the window; in a few seconds the other was in. Then a female, carrying a torch, followed them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv watched more go across, including the witch's two surviving sons. Feersh was preceded by a female also carrying a torch. Feersh had her hand upon her shoulder. They went across more swiftly than the others had, the witch urging the obviously frightened woman ahead with low but fierce words.</p>

  <p class="normal">Seven were left to cross. Deyv ran back to the room where Vana and Hoozisst were and told them what to do. They followed him, and when they got to the room only five were in it. Jowanarr and Seelgee, the daughters, were on the plank. Jowanarr seemed to be suffering yet from the blow to her head. Her sister was behind her, her hands on Jowanarr's shoulders to steady her.</p>

  <p class="normal">A woman slave was standing by the window, a torch upheld to help light the two daughters' path. Another woman was in the window of the <i>tharakorm</i> opposite, also with a torch.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv gave the word to attack. Aejip bounded in, yowling, and hurled herself at the nearest man. Jum launched himself at a man's throat. Deyv came next, and his sword cut into another slave's neck. The Yawtl stuck the point of his sword into the belly of the fourth man. The woman, screaming, dropped her torch and got onto the plank. Deyv kicked her hard, and she went off the side of the plank.</p>

  <p class="normal">While the animals were still struggling, quite successfully, with their victims, Deyv and Hoozisst grabbed the end of the plank. They heaved up on it. Jowanarr fell through the window headfirst, but her sister, shrieking, toppled off it.</p>

  <p class="normal">That left Feersh, her two sons, a daughter, and the slaves in the other ship-creature. Sloosh, if he was still in the room and not on the top deck, must have seen the situation. He'd be hurrying down now to bar their exit from the door. That is, unless he was putting the plank back so that Deyv's group could get over it and help him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv stuck his head out of the window. The plank was already bridging the gap. He turned and told the others they had to get going. By then the animals had finished off the two male slaves. Deyv ran down the corridor, dark by now, his fingers groping the wall to count the doorways. When he got to the fourth, he stopped and entered. Somebody bumped into him from behind. He stumbled forward under the impact, swore, grabbed the window edge, and halted himself. He made sure that the plank extended far enough into the room to be safe. He climbed onto the board and, his fear of being too late overcoming his fear of the abyss, ran across.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh was gone. Evidently he'd put the plank across and then hurried toward the room where Feersh was. Or where she had been.</p>

  <p class="normal">He rounded the comer. Down the corridor light shone from a doorway. Sloosh was illumined in it, one hand holding up the great war axe, the other holding his club. When he got to the doorway, Deyv found Feersh railing at her children and slaves. It was no use. They feared her, but they feared the invaders more.</p>
