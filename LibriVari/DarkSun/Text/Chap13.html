  <h1>13</h1>

  <p class="normal">THEY stood before the entrance in a driving rain that made all of them miserable. Aejip, as was the wont of cats, suffered the most. Somehow, she identified being drenched with humiliation, and it hadn't done any good for her temper. Deyv, long familiar .with the cat, knew better than to get near her during these times. So did Jum. Sloosh and Vana, however, had to learn the hard way. The woman still had a wound on her leg, not deep, which she'd gotten earlier when she had tried to console the cat. It had taken her some time to heal it. She'd sat down, and she'd closed her eyes and mentally explored her body, finding the exact healing agents, sending them to the location of the wound, urging them to fight the bacteria and to build up the flesh that would close the scratches.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv tried to urge her to go on, to ignore the wound, letting the normal processes heal it Vana had said, with a validity against which he couldn't argue, that if she allowed the wound to go untreated, it might get to a point where she couldn't control it. The jungle swarmed with invisible evil agents, and they drifted near or brushed against every opening, looking for a way in.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh didn't object to the interruption in their chase. The Yawtl couldn't get away. His red trail would lead them to him; there was no way he could cover it up.</p>

  <p class="normal">But now they stood before a pipe which was large enough for all but the plant-man to traverse. The humans could go through it at a slight crouch. He, however, would find it very hard to travel through. He'd have to bend his upper trunk parallel to it, and his lower torso would have to bend its legs considerably.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can stand it for some time," the Archkerri said. "If the pipe extends a great distance, though, I'll become immobilized. My strength is much more than yours, but I am not capable of matching your suppleness. Sometimes, a big size is a disadvantage. This seems to be one of those situations."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is the pipe?" Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This pipe is <i>a</i> pipe," the Archkerri said. "I don't know what <i>a</i> pipe <i>is</i>. I can describe a pipe for you. You would understand a pipe, then, as an ideal, though the description might not fit what others would consider a pipe. <i>The</i> pipe is—what? Verbal equivalence—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Please, let me rephrase my question," Deyv said. "What is this metallic tunnel for? Who built it? And why?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know. If I had my crystal . . . Sometimes, I wonder if my brothers, the trees and the grass, are giving me the correct data. Or they might be giving the data correctly, but then they have their own ways of recording, and during the passing of data to them to me, something is distorted, lost, translated incorrectly."</p>

  <p class="normal">"She who knows all knows nothing," Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is that a proverb of your tribe?" Sloosh asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who cares?" Deyv said angrily. "Evidently, you haven't the slightest idea where this pipe comes from, who built it, or why it was made. Really, it doesn't matter. What does is that you're as ignorant as we are."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No," Sloosh said. "What matters is that we don't know where the other end comes out. Or if there are perhaps many branchings of it. What matters even more is that I can't go into the pipe. Rather, I should say, I can go into it. But will I be able to get out the other end? I know I won't be able to back out if I go too far into it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv felt good because the huge, very strong, very knowledgeable creature was inferior in some respects to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What I see here," Deyv said, "is that we can go through this pipe. I mean, all of us except you. This pipe may have junctions, like the roads. But which path do we follow if it does? We won't know which to take, since you won't be present to follow the Yawtl's impressions."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Excellently put," the Archkerri said. "So, you four enter this while I go over the mountains by myself and hope that I come to an area where I can pick up the Yawtl's impressions. But if the pipe has many branchings, you might come out in a place I won't be near. We might lose touch with each other. You might accidentally follow his trail, but I might not be where I could see it. After all, my psychic ability to see the impressions has, coincidentally or not, the same distance limits as my visual perception."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana said, "I think it's better for all of us to go over the mountains together. Then we can see the whole situation, see where the trail comes out. Nothing will be lost doing that. But if we go into the pipe alone, we may get lost And we don't even know if it does come out the other side. And if there are branches, we could get lost. Who knows where they go? They might lead us out of the mountain area, maybe back into a branch that comes out on this side of the mountain."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "What you're saying is that Sloosh might go to the other side and see nothing. He needs to be on both sides but he can't."</p>

  <p class="normal">What a wily person the Yawtl was! He must have known the dilemma he posed when he went into the pipe. Or did he? That depended on whether or not he knew the tracking abilities of the Archkerri. And also if he knew this pipe. If he was familiar with it, then he would know where its branchings—if any—were.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You can see the Yawtl's impressions whether or not they're in the dark?" Vana asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes," Sloosh said. "But I can't see any farther than I can with my eyes in full light."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It can't be more than a mile through this mountain," she said. "Do you think you could endure that distance?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know. The question is, is it worth it to me to attempt that distance? Another question, even more pertinent, is, will it be only a mile? If the trail leads into branchings, and it could, what then?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We'll go over the mountain instead of through it," Deyv said. "If Sloosh doesn't see the tracks from there, then we can backtrack and see if they come out this side."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But," Vana said, "they might not come out on the other side. What if the pipe has a branch that comes out where Sloosh can't see? And what if it doesn't come out of the mountain at all?"</p>

  <p class="normal">This was a valid suggestion. But Deyv felt that they must come to a quick decision. The possibilities were so many that they could argue for a long time. Meanwhile, the Yawtl was traveling through the pipe. More likely, he had already done so.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "In any group, there should be one leader. So far, we've not been able to determine that. I would assume the position, since I'm more intelligent, that is, in my definition, more knowledgeable than you two. But you humans have something which we Archkerri don't have. That is, a fierce drive toward leadership. That is, some of you have it and some don't. But there is among you always the feeling in a group that one person should be the leader. The idea of committeeship—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't want to discuss that idea now," Deyv said. "One of us should be the chief. We need quick decisions, not one arrived at after many long discussions, sometimes so late that the problem has been succeeded by another and the first is dead."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All right," Vana said, looking angry. "You can be the leader. Now. But if you don't make the right decision, then you're out. And I'm in. I think I'm as quick and accurate as you are. But—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is good thinking, Vana," Sloosh said. "So, we'll go over the mountain. And we'll see what we'll see."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good," Deyv said. "Only I'm sending Jum through the pipe. This is a situation where his sense of smell should be right on the nose—if you'll pardon my pun."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah," the Archkerri said. "I forgot about that. In certain circumstances, the dog's abilities in tracking can be as good or even better than mine."</p>

  <p class="normal">Jum didn't like Deyv's commands, but he entered the pipe. The others started climbing the slopes.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took two and a half sleep-times. Deyv worried about the dog. What if Jum got lost and couldn't find his way out? It was possible that the Yawtl would pass through water, in which case Jum would lose his scent. Moreover, there might be predators in the pipe which could quickly dispose of Jum.</p>

  <p class="normal">They came around the shoulder of the peak, half of which towered almost vertically above them. Below, at the foot, was an immense valley. It was covered with forest except in the middle, where a river ran. Far to their left, the valley was blocked by something gigantic and shiny green. From this distance it was impossible to tell what it was. Water flowed around its sides, forming two cataracts.</p>

  <p class="normal">Directly opposite them was a mountain even more precipitous. Beyond that, more peaks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If the pipe has one or more terminations on this side," Sloosh said, "we're too far away to see them. Even if they weren't covered by the jungle."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv wondered if he'd ever see Jum again. He felt pangs of guilt about having sent the dog into the pipe alone. Sighing, he started the descent</p>

  <p class="normal">Within a sleep-time and a half, they were by the river. This was about half a mile across and, judging by its smooth green surface, at least as deep.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri studied the river for a moment and said, "We're in luck. I can see the impressions of the Yawti out there. He went that way."</p>

  <p class="normal">He pointed through the thick brush and giant trees along the bank. Aejip disappeared to hunt. There was plenty of fruit here, so the three had no trouble stuffing themselves. Just as they were about to look for a good sleeping place, they made a discovery. It was the site where the Yawtl had recently fashioned a dugout. Chips of wood, the trunk of a small tree, branches, and severed liana made this obvious.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He used an <i>iyvrat</i> tree," Deyv said. "Its wood is very soft; he could hack the tree down and chop out its interior in half a sleep-time if he worked hard. There are plenty of <i>iyvrat</i> here. We can make our own dugout."</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked at the Archkerri's great bulk.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Dugouts, I mean. Do you think you could paddle, Sloosh?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed, "Yes. Your dog has been here, too."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know," Vana said. "I just stepped in his mess."</p>

  <p class="normal">She went to the river to wash her foot. A little later, Jum bounced from the jungle and leaped all over Deyv, his tail wagging, his rear wiggling, his tongue licking. Deyv grabbed him and hugged him and scratched him behind the ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's evident now that we should have gone through the pipe," Sloosh said. "We might have caught up with the thief while he was making the boat. I'm surprised that Jum didn't—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He may have lost his trail for a while in the jungle. The Yawtl could have taken to the trees, you know. Besides, the Yawtl was far ahead of us. Maybe he had time to build the boat and get away before Jum caught up with him. Anyway, I'm happy that he's still well and alive."</p>

  <p class="normal">"More probably Jum went hunting and so wasted time," Sloosh said. "He can't be blamed for that, though."</p>

  <p class="normal">They set to work chopping down two trees. Sloosh had no weapons or tools, so he was of no help. He did watch the humans' techniques carefully, though. By the time Deyv and Vana were into the hollowing-out of the trunks, the cat showed up. She was panting and worn out, having dragged a large bird some distance by the neck. When alive it must have stood about six feet high. Its wings were rudimentary; its head was huge and armed with a sharp curving beak. Its three toes bore large sharp talons. Evidently, Aejip had managed to surprise it from above and killed it almost at once. Given a chance, it would have been dangerous prey for Aejip.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana and Deyv peeled the skin off with the feathers still on, cut the bird up, and cooked it All five ate until their bellies bulged, and then they went off to find a good sleeping place. By then carrion birds, insects, and several crocodilian mammals, the <i>athaksum,</i> had gathered nearby to clean up. The travelers could hear the furious squabble as they went through the bush.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the party had slept awhile, though not nearly long enough, they returned to the half-made boats. Aejip went off hunting again. By the time she'd returned, empty-jawed this time, the craft were done.</p>

  <p class="normal">Paddles were fashioned then, during which time Sloosh fished, with a pole, line, and hook Deyv had made. The Archkerri didn't catch anything.</p>

  <p class="normal">The smaller boat was for Vana and Aejip. The larger was an outrigger, since Deyv figured that Sloosh would tip the boat over easily unless provisions were made to prevent this. They launched the craft, and soon they were heading upriver along the bank, where the current was weakest. Sloosh sat in the rear on his haunches, his front legs folded, an enormous paddle in his hands. Deyv was in the middle, the dog in front of him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Shortly before it was time to sleep again, Sloosh said, "The Yawtl went over to the other bank. He didn't go ashore there, though. His impressions continue upriver."</p>

  <p class="normal">They were very tired by then, even though they'd rested often, beaching the boats. Deyv insisted that they might as well make an effort to cross the river. They did so, and they slept ashore. When they awakened, Deyv started to fish, but Sloosh demanded that he be allowed to try it. His failure had disturbed him; he regarded it as a challenge. Deyv went out with Jum, and Aejip went by herself to hunt. Vana looked around for fruit and berries. All got what they wanted, so they set out with stuffed bellies. Most of Vana's pickings were in woven baskets in the boats. They ate these during the rests.</p>

  <p class="normal">The strange gleaming green object at the end of the valley grew larger. By now they could make out its details. It seemed to be about half a mile wide and almost as high. It was set where the valley walls suddenly narrowed, forming a natural dam. However, when they saw that its surface was cut into facets, Sloosh said that it couldn't be natural.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What it is," he said, "believe it or not, is a <i>trishmaging."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv called to Vana, whose boat was alongside his. "What's a <i>trishmaging?"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a beautiful, very rare semitransparent hard stone.</p>

  <p class="normal">The ancients cut facets into it. My shaman has one like this, though it's very small. Small enough to be worn on a finger if if s set in a wooden ring. The shaman got it during the Trading Season. The warrior who traded it had found five of these stones, each different from the others. They were in the dirt of a hillside washed down by rains along with a few other things made by the ancients. One stone was set in a ring made of a yellow metal. Evidently, the ancients wore the beautiful cut stones in rings."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But this stone! What sky-high giant wore it in a ring?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "Those stones were probably natural. But this one ... it was manufactured by the ancients. For what reason, I do not know. Perhaps as a dam which the waters would never wash away. I doubt it, though."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv looked at the colossal precious stone with awe. How mighty the ancients! Yet, they had perished, and all that remained of them were a few relics.</p>
