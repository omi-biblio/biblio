  <h1>23</h1>

  <p class="normal">FOR a little while, no one spoke. Feersh smiled broadly as if it was all she could do to keep from laughing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Sloosh moved toward her. As if that broke the spell, Hoozisst leaped at her with both hands half-closed. The plant-man had expected this, which was why he had stepped over to the witch. Sloosh's great hand closed on the Yawtl's shoulder, and Sloosh lifted him up.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst, feet kicking, his face bent with both anger and pain, screamed, "Let me down! I'll kill her!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll release you when you promise to keep your promise," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But she tricked us! I told you she would!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's a good point, but it's our fault. Mostly mine, since I should've been intelligent enough to make sure she didn't trick us. However, we must ascertain that she is indeed telling the truth. If she isn't, the agreement is no good."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl looked at Sloosh. His anger was gone, though the pain in his shoulder was still there.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let me down. I won't touch her."</p>

  <p class="normal">His feet on the floor, Hoozisst rubbed his shoulder. He said, "I think you could <i>squeeze</i> the truth out of her. Very well, how do we find out if she's telling the truth? She doesn't have a soul egg."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Any soul egg will do."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana and Deyv said, "What?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst said, "You're crazy! Only her own egg would be in phase with her mind! Everybody knows that!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is one of those many cases among you flesh-sapients where what 'everybody knows' is only what everybody says. When I lived with the People of the Striped House I made an experiment. I talked two people into exchanging eggs temporarily, though they were very reluctant to do so. And I found that any egg would do as a lie detector."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv felt that the statement was close to blasphemy. But, knowing by now that Sloosh wouldn't lie, he said nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst yanked an egg-cord off a slave, breaking it and felling the slave to his knees. He strode to the witch and thrust it into her hand. "Hold that in your fingers so we may see what the egg shows!" he shouted. "Hold it against your flabby breast, you bitch!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh went gray under the dark-brown skin. She spoke steadily enough, however. "I only half-lied. It's true that the eggs and crystal are not on the <i>tharakorm.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">They are not, though, in the fungus around the tree. I placed them in a cave high on a mountainside. The mountain is on the other side of the river you took to get to the forest."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Put the egg against your breast!"</p>

  <p class="normal">She did so, and she repeated what she'd said. The egg turned blue shot with writhing starlike figures.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So!" the Yawtl said. "You thought we'd <i>go</i> to that tree, and by then you would've escaped us. You would be safe someplace where you could laugh at us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"She may have meant to cheat us," Sloosh said. "That is the way of witches. But I doubt it. She had another reason for not telling us the truth. Witch, what is it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst translated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh said, "It's a long story. The main reason I sent this thief out to get the eggs is that I had to have people of a certain character to do something for me. Only <i>they</i> might be able to complete my mission. Hoozisst was my tool, a good one, but I wasn't about to reward the greedy creature with the Emerald of Anticipation. He says he's wearing it now, so he has been paid off. He shouldn't bear a grudge. If he'd been in my place, he would have done the same. Wouldn't you, Yawtl?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst bared his sharp teeth, but he nodded. "I was a little hasty in wanting to get rid of you," he said. "I forgot that you'd also promised to show me how the stone works."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Which I'll do. Anyway, all this business has to do with The Shemibob."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed amazement through his beak. "She <i>still</i> lives?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst translated this.</p>

  <p class="normal">"As far as I know. The last one to see her alive, to be able to tell about it, that is, was a slave of hers. She is the only one who's ever escaped from The Shining House of Countless Chambers."</p>

  <p class="normal">She paused, undoubtedly for dramatic effect.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was that slave!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh was delighted. "There is so much you can tell me about The Shemibob. We Archkerri haven't been able to get any data about her from our vegetable kin for a long time. The Jeweled Wasteland has been steadily, if slowly, growing, and where it is, there are no plants. Eventually, as you must know, The Wasteland will cover all the land mass."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We can get those details later," Deyv said impatiently before Hoozisst could translate. "Tell your story as it concerns those whose eggs were stolen."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Those details, as you call them, are a vital part of my story. When I was a very young woman, I went into the dreaded land of The Shemibob, which some also call, with good reason, The Bright Abomination. My mother had tried to kill me because she found out that I was planning to kill her. I had grown tired of waiting for her to die. So I fled just in time, and I was that most contemptible and pitiable of creatures, a witch with no ancient artifacts. So I decided to steal into The Wasteland and rob The Shemibob of some. I had heard that she had a great treasure of them. That's not surprising, since she had a long time to collect them and had many to begin with."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How 1ong?" Vana asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your language doesn't have the words for it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell her, Hoozisst, that I've taught you three of the terms," Sloosh said. "Your minds know them, even if they can't grasp their meaning."</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh said, "The Archkerri's words are not the same as mine. But The Shemibob has lived on Earth almost ten thousand sleep-times multiplied by a thousand plus ten thousand. How old she was when she came here from a distant star, I don't know."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Almost as old," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Old enough to get a few wrinkles," Feersh said. She smiled, but Deyv didn't know if she meant to be funny.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only a very young, foolhardy, and ignorant girl would have done what I did," Feersh said. "I would've been better off if I'd hidden in the jungle around my mother's House and watched for a chance to get back in it and kill her. But I was ambitious. I thought that if I could rob The Shemibob, I would then be the most powerful witch in the world. So I dared to enter the land of The Shemibob. And The Shemibob caught me, though she did say I'd gotten deeper into her land than anyone else.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was her slave for a long time. It wasn't a hard life, once I got used to her terrifying appearance. Unlike the other slaves, I was very curious, and I tried to learn everything I could from her. She liked to talk with me. Sometimes I thought that the only reason she lured people into her land was so she'd have somebody to talk to. While I was there I prowled around a lot, keeping my eyes open, and picked out those possessions I wanted to take with me. But there were so many that I had to select just a few. I couldn't have carried one-thirtieth of what I desired and what could be removed. Many of the possessions were surrounded by safeguards which I dared not pass.</p>

  <p class="normal">"She once told me that she was not inherently long-lived. One of her treasures was the secret of longevity. But she did not have that hidden somewhere in The Pulsing Castle. It was not in a concealed chamber set all around with traps. She carried the secret in her mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I asked her why she didn't give it to her slaves. Then she wouldn't have to depend upon catching would-be robbers to keep up her supply of slaves. She smiled—a most ghastly smile—and she said that if she'd done that long ago, the slaves might have become as wise as she and then would either have killed her or run away with her artifacts.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Also, there would be no use in telling the slaves now, even if she changed her mind about keeping the secret to herself. What good would it do? Within a comparatively short time, Earth would be torn apart by the power of stars too .near. And then all stars and star dust, everything, would fall together and become an unimaginably enormous ball of fire. This would explode and then—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sloosh has told us about that," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes? Anyway, I wasn't as terrified or as surprised as she seemed to think I would be. We witches have our own knowledge. Though, to tell the truth, it wasn't so much knowledge as speculation which depended upon doom-tales we'd heard from the savages. Especially the Yawtl.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And why should I care? I'd be dead long before the last sleep-times of Earth came. But then The Shemibob said that perhaps there might be a way of avoiding the cataclysm. The density of the ever-increasing amount of matter twists space itself. And this could result in gateways to another world. Or perhaps many other worlds.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I didn't understand this completely. I had to take her word for it. But she didn't seem to be lying just to pass the time."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell her that we Archkerri have similar theories about that," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You Archkerri have theories about everything," Feersh said. "Some of them are bound to be right I asked her if she knew of any doors to these other worlds where perhaps the universe was not contracting but was young, expanding. She said that there could be one in her land, out in the crystals. It was a strange fearful phenomenon, the reason why The Wasteland is sometimes called The Bright Abomination.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But if the phenomenon was what she thought it was, it wasn't as yet a route to another world. She had tried to enter it but had failed. Perhaps, in time, it would be penetrable. Then again, perhaps it would never be. And even if it should be, it might only be to another world like ours, one that is dying."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst said, "A likely tale! What I think is that The Shemibob made up the whole thing. She did that so people would hear about it and come to her land hoping to get through this door to that other world. Then she'd have more slaves."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How could anybody outside The Wasteland hear about it?" Feersh said. "I was the only one ever to escape from it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, you weren't," Sloosh buzzed. "There were others."</p>

  <p class="normal">"See?" the Yawtl said. "She lets a slave get away now and then so that they can spread lying stories to entice others to her. Undoubtedly, she allowed you to escape."</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh looked angry. "Really? With some of her treasures?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl shrugged. "She has plenty to spare—according to you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The story of her great trove of ancient devices is true. So why shouldn't the other story be true?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"A true story makes you willing to believe the next story, which is a big lie."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Enough of this," Sloosh said. "You still haven't told us why you wanted the soul eggs. Aside from the fact they had to be the eggs of people who had a certain character."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Shemibob knows what it is that makes a person near-immortal. If she could be captured and then tortured, she would reveal the secret. Ordinary means might not make her talk, but she has things which could force the truth from any being.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And once one was near-immortal, one could find a way to get to another world. Then one could live forever, barring accident, murder, or suicide. When the new world became old and was about to die, one could again escape through a gateway. And so on."</p>

  <p class="normal">"By <i>one,</i> you mean you," Hoozisst said.</p>

  <p class="normal">She glared. "I'm willing to share. Anyway, I'm too old to venture into her land again. Even if I were young enough, I couldn't do it by myself. I should have tried it while I was still able, but I didn't think of it then. I was busy with many things, though mostly trying to survive. Then I captured three <i>tharakorm</i> after I decided that my House was too vulnerable. I got slaves, and I had my children so that one could inherit.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And then I thought about how death was approaching, and I conceived the idea of how I could keep from dying and perhaps live as long as The Shemibob. So I set a Yawtl to stealing certain eggs. He was to lead their owners here. If they were smart and tough enough to get this far—that far, rather—then they might be able to do what I wanted.</p>

  <p class="normal">"When I captured them, I treated them well. I told them that they must get to The Wasteland and then they must somehow get The Shemibob's secrets. They didn't go alone; they were usually in groups of five or six. If they succeeded, then I would return their eggs. And I would let them go with me through the gateway."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That was nice of you," Hoozisst said, sneering. "What was to keep them from staying there, once they were near-immortal? Oh, I see ... their eggs!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri said, "But why didn't you moor your <i>tharakorm</i> near The Wasteland? You could then have gotten your candidates there, and they wouldn't have had to travel so far. The Shemibob's land is near the other end of the land mass. From the mooring place to there is a very long way and full of many dangers."</p>

  <p class="normal">After Hoozisst translated, Feersh said, "Do you think I'm stupid? I did just that in the beginning. But the people I sent in failed. So I unmoored and sailed across The Wasteland and out over the end of the land and across the ocean, which can be traversed within five sleep-times with a good wind, to the other end of the land. Then I moored at different widely spaced places, and I started the whole process over. I used different thieves, of course, most of which were Yawtl. They are a cunning species, though not of high intelligence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Intelligent enough to outsmart you, hag!" Hoozisst said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You could never have done it, if you hadn't had the dumb luck to steal a plant-man's crystal. The Yawtl make good thieves, but they are too greedy to be trusted. Anyway, I would move on from time to time to get new groups after an area had been cleared of candidates. As for the great distances to be covered, I suggested that the candidates find young tharakorm and float with the winds toward The Wasteland. Or that they get to the shore and sail on the ocean."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If s a desperate scheme, and I suspect that all your candidates have failed—so far," Sloosh said. "But if you moved so much, how would they find you if they did succeed?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They would wait in The Wasteland until I got there."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But by then they would have discovered that they didn't need their eggs," Sloosh said. "That is one more flaw."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "They would never be able to abandon their eggs forever!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have much to learn yet."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're out of your mind," Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">The witch said, "After I'd sent you on your mission, I would have put your eggs back on here. But you ruined that. However, now you know where they are. You can come back and get them after you've completed your mission."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv and Vana looked at each other. Did she really believe that they were going to venture into the monster's territory? Now that they knew the location of their, soul eggs?</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst was of a different mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Once I have the powers of The Shemibob, I'll send people after my egg. They can risk the dangers. They won't run out on me, since I'll do as you did, hag. I'll hold their eggs until they get back. And, as an extra incentive, I'll promise them one or two of The Shemibob's former possessions."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was indeed stupid and avaricious.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh must have read the expression on Deyv's and Vana's faces. He said, "From what I know of The Shemibob's powers, I would suspect that anyone who had access to them could <i>make</i> their own eggs."</p>

  <p class="normal">Startled, Deyv said, "Do you really think so?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The witch asked for a translation. It seemed to amaze her, too. "That never occurred to me! Then—oh, Shkanshuk! Then . . . those I sent, if they succeeded, would never return to me! No, it can't be! It's unthinkable!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I just thought it," the Archkerri said. "But perhaps the sapients you sent out are not so sapient."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wouldn't want to be in your robe if you found out that one of them was now ruling The Wasteland," Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh became even paler.</p>
