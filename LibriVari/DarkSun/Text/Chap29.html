  <h1>29</h1>

  <p class="normal">"AT least, they didn't kill us at once," Vana said. "Though we might regret that they didn't."</p>

  <p class="normal">They were in a small, one-room building, the only one built of logs. The rest were the round bamboo huts that seemed prevalent throughout this country. A log stockade surrounded the village, which was on top of a high cliff. The sea boomed against its base, but nearby was a wide sandy beach which held the fishing boats. Sloosh thought they'd built the village so high to avoid the tsunamis.</p>

  <p class="normal">All their captors except the children were painted with green and red stripes, six-pointed stars, and circles enclosing swastikas. The latter, Sloosh told his uninterested audience, were ancient symbols, so old that the earliest men had painted them on rocks and on the walls of their tents or hogans. However, the symbolism attached to them had varied greatly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Will the symbols enable us to escape?" the Yawtl asked sarcastically.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri said, "Who knows? Almost anything can be a tool if if s used correctly."</p>

  <p class="normal">The only entrance was a heavy log door with a thick log as a bar on the outside. There were four windows, all too small for any but a child to wriggle through. Two Tsimmanbul males stood guard at the door and one outside each window. Otherwise, the village seemed to be in its usual routine. The young were running around playing, the females were cooking and gossiping, males were coming in with fish, game, or fruit or were empty-handed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman sat on a bamboo stool in front of his hut. He wore a tall feathered headdress, a green and purple egg on a cord around his thick neck, a white and black checked fiber kilt, and fringed leather bands just below the knee. A thick film of rancid fat glistened over the paint and the bare skin.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the packed earth at the shaman's feet were six half-foot-long sticks. Every now and then he'd pick these up, shake a large gourd rattle while shrilling some sort of a chant, and then he would throw the sticks into the air. Afterward, he'd study the pattern they made on the ground.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prisoners had been in the cabin for three sleep-times. Aside from a beating by children and women when they'd been brought in, they hadn't been ill-treated. The food was good and plentiful. Their evacuations were regularly emptied from large bamboo buckets, which were washed out before being returned. And they were let out, one at a time, to exercise.</p>

  <p class="normal">Shortly after they'd been locked up, a female had started language lessons. She stood outside the door and held up objects, giving each its name. It wasn't easy to imitate the pipings, but it could be done. Sloosh could only buzz. The teacher, however, soon was able to make a correlation between his modulated sounds and hers.</p>

  <p class="normal">The lessons made the cat and the dog, who'd also been shut up with them, nervous at first. After a while, they got used to it.</p>

  <p class="normal">A good part of the time, the shaman sat casting his sticks. Other times he would leave the village on some business, no doubt sinister. When he was absent, the children would come close to the door and talk to the prisoners. The captives made more progress conversing with the youngsters than with the teacher.</p>

  <p class="normal">A Tsimmanbul captive, whose paint showed he was of an enemy tribe, was brought in by a war party. He was put in a hut and stayed there, except for exercise, for ten sleep-times. The shaman visited him frequently, always taking in with him a fiber cage that held a giant firefly. At the end of this period, the captive was taken away. The whole village celebrated this, beating drums, blowing whistles, playing flutes, twanging tortoise-shell harps, chanting, dancing, and taking turns daubing the captive until he was a solid black color.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he was bound and carried out of the stockade in a palanquin. Everybody but the guards went with him. At the end of seven sleep-times, they returned. The palanquin still carried the prisoner, but he was only a skull and skeleton. The clean-picked bones were dumped out onto the ground. The shaman took the skull into his house, and the bones were burned in a huge bonfire amidst another wild celebration.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "Note that there was a small hole in the breastbone and several in the top of the skull."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What does that mean?" Vana asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know, but we'll find out, though I suspect we won't like it."</p>

  <p class="normal">He paused, then said, "Still, why should they take the trouble and expense of feeding us and teaching us their language only to kill us? It doesn't seem logical. I'll admit, though, that this conclusion is based on insufficient data. Their prisoner, from what I heard of his pipings as he was carried off, spoke the same language as the others. Perhaps the victim is required to give certain responses in a ritual. That might explain why we've not been killedâ€”as yet."</p>

  <p class="normal">This speculation seemed to be wrong. What the Tsimmanbul wanted, at the moment, anyway, was satisfaction of their curiosity. When the captives were fluent enough to answer detailed questions, they received a barrage of them. Where did they come from? What was their tribal life like? What were they doing here so far from their homes? Was the plant-man a god, demon, or just what he seemed to be?</p>

  <p class="normal">The idea that they thought he might be a god and yet could be so easily caught intrigued Sloosh. He asked the shaman, Fat Bull, their main inquisitor, why this was.</p>

  <p class="normal">Fat Bull replied that catching gods and demons was the main business of his kind, the Narakannetishaw.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the generic name of this species, Tsimmanbul being the Yawtl's name for them. Their captors' speech didn't have consonants or vowels. The prisoners had arbitrarily assigned these sound-values to the modulation units so that they could use the Narakannetishaw names in their own speech.</p>

  <p class="normal">Fat Bull explained that in the beginning, when their ancestors left the sea, they'd had no gods. So, feeling the need for them, they had captured them and made them their own.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's a myth," Sloosh said in his own language so the shaman wouldn't understand him. "Very interesting, though."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We make raids on other villages and Houses," the shaman continued. "Be they Narakannetishaw, Yawtl, human, or Skinniwakitaw, we raid them, take their gods, and bring them here."</p>

  <p class="normal">He pointed at his house, the largest in the village.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And our enemies also raid us, though so far we've been more successful than they. However, we have caught a god who seems to have turned the tables on us. He's caught us. I don't mean that he's taken any of us captive, but he might as well have. We can't move him, and he insists that we sacrifice someone every thirty sleep-times. When we don't have enemies to give him, we have to use one of our own tribe. We don't like that at all."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't blame you," Deyv said. "Nobody likes to be killed. But I must admit I don't really understand what you've said. How can a god force you to take sacrifices to him if he stays in one place? Which I assume isn't close to here?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who can read the minds of men, let alone the minds of the gods? He has some reason, Phemropit does. Actually, we can't talk to him. So we don't really know what he wants. But it's much safer to assume that he does require sacrifices. He hasn't rejected any, so he must want them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We've been economical, though, killing two birds with one stone, as it were. We make the sacrifices ask the god certain things. We think that if the god does finally reply, he may come to dwell in my house. And then I, I mean we, would have great power. With this we could exterminate our enemies and from then on live in peace. We'd also be able to use their fishing space and to have more babies. In time, we'd become so numerous and powerful that no wandering tribes would dare settle down here."</p>

  <p class="normal">"An old story," Sloosh said in Archkerri. "The once too-peaceful Tsimmanbul are now as savage as you humans."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "So we'll be the next sacrifices?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman smiled, a ghastly thing to see.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, unless we take some more enemies first. I'd like you to be even better in our language before you go to talk to Phemropit. You have wandered far and wide, if your story is true. You come from different tribes. Perhaps you might have the wisdom and experience which we stay-at-homes lack. You might ask him the right questions. If you do, you won't be killed by Phemropit. And you'll be set free."</p>

  <p class="normal">He paused, then said nonchalantly, "By the way, that cube. I've spent much time in my house looking at it. What is its purpose?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh started to buzz. Deyv said, "Shut up! Now is no time to tell the truth!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He spoke to Fat Bull. "That is a magical weapon of immense power. Unfortunately, it is so destructive that we can't use it without destroying ourselves. If we'd set it off when we were caught in the net, we'd have slain ourselves and the netters, and the jungle would have been blown apart, and a great flame would have swept to the sea and burned your village and the people in it to ashes within a second.</p>

  <p class="normal">"One of the things we were seeking was a shield we'd heard about. This belongs to a witch. We were going to steal the shield and use it to protect ourselves when we did unleash the weapon."</p>

  <p class="normal">Apparently, the shaman believed the big whopper. He said, "That rod sticking out of the cube? Does pulling on that release this terrible magic?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"If you also use a certain chant at the same time," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't suppose you'd be willing to tell me what it is?" Fat Bull said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Certainly, if you release us," Deyv said. "You may have the cube as a gift in return for our freedom."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can torture the chant from you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv sweated even more heavily. He said, "Not this chant. It is set up so that I forget it if someone tries to force it from me. Only if I use it willingly will it stay with me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're very glib," Fat Bull said. "Well, we'll see what we'll see. In the meantime, learn our speech even better. It may serve you well, perhaps save your life, maybe even free you."</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman rose from his squat to his over-seven-foot height. The painted beast-prognathous face poked its nose through the bars. The huge dark eyes stared into Deyv's.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My sticks tell me that you queer strangers may be able to understand the god's language. I sincerely hope so, since I want Phemropit to come dwell in my house and tell me his secrets. Sometimes, I have bad dreams about him. Then he comes to me, walking legless, armless, and headless, and he speaks to me in his blinding manner. And he gets very angry when I can't understand him. It is not good for a god to be angry at you."</p>

  <p class="normal">When the shaman had left, Deyv said, "I wish I knew what he was talking about."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We'll find out sometime," the Yawtl said. "I hope that they take some more captives soon. That'll give us more time, though our death is inevitable."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst began prowling around again, looking for a weak place in their prison. He knew he wouldn't find any, but useless action was better than just sitting.</p>

  <p class="normal">A moment later, the ground shook and rumbled and the walls of the cabin swayed. After balancing themselves on the jellylike earth until nauseated by the motion, they threw themselves down. After a short time, the temblor ceased to affect the surface. But Deyv, his ear to the ground, could detect a very faint thunder. He got up and looked out a window. The leaves of the few trees nearby were still shaking. The Tsimmanbul were up off the dirt, piping excitedly, but ready to resume their routine.</p>

  <p class="normal">Their guards inspected the cabin to make sure that the ends of the logs were still tightly interlocked. Satisfied, they took their stations again.</p>

  <p class="normal">Some time later the big temblor was succeeded by two smaller ones. Nobody bothered to comment on them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Close to bedtime there was some excitement among the Tsimmanbul. The two log gates facing the path down the cliff to the sea swung open. Several warriors rushed in, loudly piping. The shaman was summoned, and he talked for a few moments to the warriors. Then he led the entire population, except for the guards, through the gateway. Time passed. Deyv was about to go to sleep when he heard the loud chatter of the returning natives. He got up and listened while the wife of a guard told him what had happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">Some males had come back from a hunt, and one had noticed a large fissure about twenty feet back from the cliff's edge and forty feet from the stockade. Investigation showed that the temblor had cracked the rock from side to side. Another such quake, and the mass overhanging the sea might fall off.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shaman threw his sticks and shook his rattle. Would the gods say if it was best for the village to be moved back, far from the crack? No, the shaman said, after a dozen stick throwings. The gods say that there is no dangerâ€”yet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Six sleep-times later, a war party brought in another captive, a Yawtl. He was stuck in the hut that had kept the previous enemy, and the giant firefly was also taken in to him. Sloosh asked Deyv to ask a guard if the captured Yawtl spoke Narakannetishaw. When the guard said that he did, Sloosh said, "Ah, I thought so." He wouldn't say why, however.</p>

  <p class="normal">The time came when the Yawtl was painted black and carried out in the palanquin. Seven sleep-times later, he returned in it. Sloosh commented again on the hole in the breastbone and the holes in the skull.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prisoners were not to get another stay of execution. Fat Bull told them that even if other captives were taken, they would have to face the god next.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You know our language well enough now."</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned and snapped his fingers. A guard brought in a large bamboo cage holding nine giant fireflies. Fat Bull removed a firefly and held it up so they could see it closely. The insect did not struggle, though it turned its multifaceted eyes this way and that.</p>

  <p class="normal">"See this green spot on its back?" the shaman said. "Notice now how I control the flashing of its tail. I place my thumb on the green spot. I press down gently."</p>

  <p class="normal">The insect's tail glowed with its cold light, strong enough to dispel some of the twilight of the cabin.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now I lift my thumb. The firefly immediately becomes dark. It has been trained to respond to pressure. If you were to hold your thumb on that spot, the bug would emit light until its source was exhausted.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But its power is much, and you won't be burning it out. Observe me closely now. See the length of the four pulses I make this fly emit. Four lengths of light, each a little longer than the other. With practice you'll be able to make the lengths exact. And then you'll learn how to speak our language without speaking. You will translate each word into a certain number of pulses, each word a group of so many pulses of so many lengths. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Easily," Deyv said. "The fireflies do with light what the Archkerri does with sound when he talks. All of us have had much experience with his buzzes. We won't have any trouble transferring to light pulses."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Very good," Fat Bull said. "Bluebird-woman has been teaching you our speech, so she might as well teach you how to use the fireflies. You will become almost as fluent with the light as with the sound. And then you will have the great honor of talking to Phemropit."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm not worthy of the honor," Hoozisst said.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Tsimmanbul piped laughter. "If that is so, then we might as well kill you now. After you've had a chance to demonstrate your bravery by not crying out during the torture."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perhaps I was being too modest," the Yawtl said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Grinning whitely, the shaman left the cabin.</p>

  <p class="normal">The practice started at once. Within six sleep-times, the prisoners were just beginning to master the control of the flies. Bluebird-woman said that they should be skilled enough in another ten sleep-times.</p>

  <p class="normal">Meanwhile, Sloosh got from a guard some information that excited him. The others found it slightly interesting. What did they care if there was a giant lake only three sleep-times' walk inland? Or that it had been formed from a crater made by a colossal meteorite?</p>

  <p class="normal">"It fell many, many human generations ago," the Archkerri said. "The various sapients had highly advanced civilizations then, though nowhere near as high as those that moved the Earth and that made the moon and the great outer planets into small suns.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If they had been, they would have been able to deflect or disintegrate the meteor long before it collided with Earth. This fell near here, and the explosion and earthquake that followed burned or knocked down the forests halfway across the land mass. It slew a quarter of the animal life and tumbled all the great cities. The civilizations were destroyed within a few minutes. And the few survivors became savages. They forgot their knowledge, and their descendants never recovered it. This coastline was shattered; the sea poured into the hot crater. But since then smaller cataclysms have lifted up the sea-bottom to form a new shoreline."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All tribes have tales of this," Vana said. "Though the reasons for the cataclysm and the details vary much."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm surprised that after such a long time there would even be a memory of it in the folk tales. But then the fall of the meteor was so terrible that some dim traces of the event have persisted. It had a numbing effect upon my brothers, the trees and the grass. Their own memories are vague, distorted. All plants went into shock, and many species died from this shock.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Anyway, the god is near the edge of that ancient crater. It will be a pleasure to see the lake personally and not by report through the prism."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A short-lived pleasure," the Yawtl said sourly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The dreaded time arrived. The captives, excepting the two animals, were taken from the cabin and painted black. The cat and the dog, the shaman said, would be eaten after the tribespeople returned. Deyv asked permission to say farewell to Jum and Aejip. He was refused. Weeping, calling out to the animals, Deyv was carried off. Vana wept, too, but she shouted that they would come back and free them. Jum howled, and Aejip hurled herself, roaring, against the door.</p>

  <p class="normal">Their hands tied behind them, their ankles bound, they were put into individual, brightly painted, heavily feathered palanquins. Four males lifted each of these. Amidst wild music and piping voices, they were carried through the stockade gateway. Three sleep-times later, they reached the end of their journey.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the light of a hundred torches, they saw that they were at the top of a long gentle slope. This leveled out to a rocky beach beyond which was open water. Torch-bearing Tsimmanbul stood on the beach, and others were scattered up and down the slope. Tremendous boulders, half-buried, lined the ridge of the slope; others stuck out of the slope here and there.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tall thick-trunked trees grew at widely separated intervals on the hill. One tree, however, about sixty yards from the top of the slope, had been entirely uprooted. It was not erosion that had done this. Something which had been buried deep under the tree had dug its way up under it and raised it from the soil, tearing out the roots and toppling the two-hundred-foot-high plant.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh, after studying the situation, said that the uprooter may have <i>rolled up.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">But if this were so, why hadn't the monster kept on going?</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know," the plant-man said. "It does seem to have moved of its own volition, however. Yet, how could it? The god of the Tsimmanbul is stone. Could it be the mineral kingdom's bid for life?"</p>
