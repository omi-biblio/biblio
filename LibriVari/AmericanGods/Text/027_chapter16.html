    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he tree was gone, and the world was gone, and the morning-gray sky above him was gone. The sky was now the color of midnight. There was a single cold star shining high above him, a blazing, twinkling light, and nothing else. He took a single step and almost tripped.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow looked down. There were steps cut into the rock, going down, steps so huge that he could only imagine that giants had cut them and descended them a long time ago.</p>

    <p class="normal">He clambered downward, half jumping, half vaulting from step to step. His body ached, but it was the ache of lack of use, not the tortured ache of a body that has hung on a tree until it was dead.</p>

    <p class="normal">He observed, without surprise, that he was now fully dressed, in jeans and a white T-shirt. He was barefoot. He experienced a profound moment of déjà vu: this was what he had been wearing when he stood in Czernobog’s apartment the night when Zorya Polunochnaya had come to him and told him about the constellation called Odin’s Wain. She had taken the moon down from the sky for him.</p>

    <p class="normal">He knew, suddenly, what would happen next. Zorya Polunochnaya would be there.</p>

    <p class="normal">She was waiting for him at the bottom of the steps. There was no moon in the sky, but she was bathed in moonlight nonetheless: her white hair was moon-pale, and she wore the same lace-and-linen nightdress she had worn that night in Chicago.</p>

    <p class="normal">She smiled when she saw him, and looked down, as if momentarily embarrassed. “Hello,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hi,” said Shadow.</p>

    <a id="page419"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“How are you?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” he said. “I think this is maybe another strange dream on the tree. I’ve been having crazy dreams since I got out of prison.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Her face was silvered by the moonlight (but no moon hung in that plum-black sky, and now, at the foot of the steps, even the single star was lost to view) and she looked both solemn and vulnerable. She said, “All your questions can be answered, if that is what you want. But once you learn your answers, you can never unlearn them. You have to understand that.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I got it,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">Beyond her, the path forked. He would have to decide which path to take, he knew that. But there was one thing he had to do first. He reached into the pocket of his jeans and was relieved when he felt the familiar weight of the coin at the bottom of the pocket. He eased it out, held it between finger and thumb: a 1922 Liberty dollar. “This is yours,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">He remembered then that his clothes were really at the foot of the tree. The women had placed his clothes in the canvas sack from which they had taken the ropes, and tied the end of the sack, and the biggest of the women had placed a heavy rock on it to stop it from blowing away. And so he knew that, in reality, the Liberty dollar was in a pocket in that sack, beneath the rock. But still, it was heavy in his hand, at the entrance to the underworld.</p>

    <p class="normal">She took it from his palm with her slim fingers.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Thank you. It bought you your liberty twice,” she said. “And now it will light your way into dark places.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She closed her hand around the dollar, then she reached up and placed it in the air, as high as she could reach. She let go of it. Shadow knew, then, that this was another dream, for instead of falling, the coin floated upward until it was a foot or so above Shadow’s head. It was no longer a silver coin, though. Lady Liberty and her crown of spikes were gone. The face he saw on the coin was the indeterminate face of the moon in the summer sky, the face that was only visible until you stared at it, whereupon it would become dark seas and shapes on the moon’s cratered surface, the pattern and the face replaced by shadows of pure randomness and chance.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow could not decide whether he was looking at a moon the size <a id="page420"></a>of a dollar, a foot above his head; or whether he was looking at a moon the size of the Pacific Ocean, many thousands of miles away. Nor whether there was any difference between the two ideas. Perhaps it was all a matter of perspective. Perhaps it was all a matter of point of view.</p>

    <p class="normal">He looked at the forking path ahead of him.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Which path should I take?” he asked. “Which one is safe?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Take one, and you cannot take the other,” she said. “But neither path is safe. Which way would you walk—the way of hard truths or the way of fine lies?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow hesitated. “Truths,” he said. “I’ve come too far for more lies.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She looked sad. “There will be a price,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ll pay it. What’s the price?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Your name,” she said. “Your real name. You will have to give it to me.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“How?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Like this,” she said. She reached a perfect hand toward his head. He felt her fingers brush his skin, then he felt them penetrate his skin, his skull, felt them push deep into his head. Something tickled, in his skull and all down his spine. She pulled her hand out of his head. A flame, like a candle-flame but burning with a clear magnesium-white luminance, was flickering on the tip of her forefinger.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Is that my name?” he asked.</p>

    <p class="normal">She closed her hand, and the light was gone. “It was,” she said. She extended her hand, and pointed to the right-hand path. “That way,” she said. “For now.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Nameless, Shadow walked down the right-hand path in the moonlight. When he turned around to thank her, he saw nothing but darkness. It seemed to him that he was deep under the ground, but when he looked up into the darkness above him he still saw the tiny moon.</p>

    <p class="normal">He turned a corner.</p>

    <p class="normal">If this was the afterlife, he thought, it was a lot like the House on the Rock: part diorama, part nightmare.</p>

    <p class="normal">He was looking at himself in prison blues, in the warden’s office, as the warden told him that Laura had died in a car crash. He saw the expression on his own face—he looked like a man who had been abandoned by the world. It hurt him to see it, the nakedness and the fear. He <a id="page421"></a>hurried on, pushed through the warden’s gray office, and found himself looking at the VCR repair store on the outskirts of Eagle Point. Three years ago. Yes.</p>

    <p class="normal">Inside the store, he knew, he was beating the living crap out of Larry Powers and B. J. West, bruising his knuckles in the process: pretty soon he would walk out of there, carrying a brown supermarket bag filled with twenty-dollar bills. The money they could never prove he had taken: his share of the proceeds, and a little more, for they shouldn’t have tried to rip him and Laura off like that. He was only the driver, but he had done his part, done everything that she had asked of him…</p>

    <p class="normal">At the trial, nobody mentioned the bank robbery, although he was certain everybody wanted to. They couldn’t prove a thing, as long as nobody was talking. And nobody was. The prosecutor was forced instead to stick to the bodily damage that Shadow had inflicted on Powers and West. He showed photographs of the two men on their arrival in the local hospital. Shadow barely defended himself in court; it was easier that way. Neither Powers nor West seemed able to remember what the fight had been about, but they each admitted that Shadow had been their assailant.</p>

    <p class="normal">Nobody talked about the money.</p>

    <p class="normal">Nobody even mentioned Laura, and that was all that Shadow had wanted.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow wondered whether the path of comforting lies would have been a better one to walk. He walked away from that place, and followed the rock path down into what looked like a hospital room, a public hospital in Chicago, and he felt the bile rise in his throat. He stopped. He did not want to look. He did not want to keep walking.</p>

    <p class="normal">In the hospital bed his mother was dying again, as she’d died when he was sixteen, and, yes, here he was, a large, clumsy sixteen-year-old with acne pocking his cream-and-coffee skin, sitting at her bedside, unable to look at her, reading a thick paperback book. Shadow wondered what the book was, and he walked around the hospital bed to inspect it more closely. He stood between the bed and the chair looking from the one to the other, the big boy hunched into his chair, his nose buried in <span class="italic">Gravity’s Rainbow,</span> trying to escape from his mother’s death into London during the blitz, the fictional madness of the book no escape and no excuse.</p>

    <a id="page422"></a> 

    <p class="normal">His mother’s eyes were closed in a morphine peace: what she had thought was just another sickle-cell crisis, another bout of pain to be endured, had turned out, they had discovered, too late, to be lymphoma. There was a lemonish-gray tinge to her skin. She was in her early thirties, but she looked much older.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow wanted to shake himself, the awkward boy that he once was, get him to hold her hand, talk to her, do <span class="italic">something</span> before she slipped away, as he knew that she would. But he could not touch himself, and he continued to read; and so his mother died while he sat in the chair next to her, reading a fat book.</p>

    <p class="normal">After that he had more or less stopped reading. You could not trust fiction. What good were books, if they couldn’t protect you from something like that?</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow walked away from the hospital room, down the winding corridor, deep into the bowels of the earth.</p>

    <p class="normal">He sees his mother first and he cannot believe how young she is, not yet twenty-five he guesses, before her medical discharge and they’re in their apartment, another embassy rental somewhere in Northern Europe, he looks around for something to give him a clue, and he’s just a shrimp of a kid now, big pale-gray eyes and straight dark hair. They are arguing. Shadow knows without hearing the words what they’re arguing about: it was the only thing they quarreled about, after all.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—Tell me about my father.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—He’s dead. Don’t ask about him.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—But who was he?</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—Forget him. Dead and gone and you ain’t missed nothing</span>.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—I want to see a picture of him.</span></p>

    <p class="normal">—<span class="italic">I ain’t got a picture,</span> she’d say, and her voice would get quiet and fierce, and he knew that if he kept asking her questions she would shout, or even hit him, and he knew that he could not stop asking questions, so he turned away and walked on down the tunnel.</p>

    <p class="normal">The path he followed twisted and wound and curled back on itself, and it put him in mind of snakeskins and intestines and of deep, deep tree roots. There was a pool to his left; he heard the <span class="italic">drip, drip</span> of water into it somewhere at the back of the tunnel, the falling water barely ruffling the <a id="page423"></a>mirrored surface of the pool. He dropped to his knees and drank, using his hand to bring the water to his lips. Then he walked on until he was standing in the floating disco-glitter patterns of a mirror-ball. It was like being in the exact center of the universe with all the stars and planets circling him, and he could not hear anything, not the music, nor the shouted conversations over the music, and now Shadow was staring at a woman who looked just like his mother never looked in all the years he knew her, she’s little more than a child, after all…</p>

    <p class="normal">And she is dancing.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow found that he was completely unsurprised when he recognized the man who dances with her. He had not changed that much in thirty-three years.</p>

    <p class="normal">She is drunk: Shadow could see that at a glance. She is not very drunk, but she is unused to drink, and in a week or so she will take a ship to Norway. They have been drinking margaritas, and she has salt on her lips and salt clinging to the back of her hand.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wednesday is not wearing a suit and tie, but the pin in the shape of a silver tree he wears over the pocket of his shirt glitters and glints when the mirror-ball light catches it. He does not dance badly; they make a fine-looking couple, considering the difference in their ages. There is a lupine grace to his movements.</p>

    <p class="normal">A slow dance. He pulls her close to him, and his paw-like hand curves around the seat of her skirt possessively, moving her closer to him. His other hand takes her chin, pushes it upward into his face, and the two of them kiss, there on the floor, as the glitter-ball lights circle them into the center of the universe.</p>

    <p class="normal">Soon after, they leave. She sways against him, and he leads her from the dance hall. Shadow buries his head in his hands, and does not follow them, unable or unwilling to witness his own conception.</p>

    <p class="normal">The mirror lights were gone, and now the only illumination came from the tiny moon that burned high above his head.</p>

    <p class="normal">He walked on. At a bend in the path he stopped for a moment, to catch his breath.</p>

    <p class="normal">He felt a hand run gently up his back, and gentle fingers ruffle the hair on the back of his head.</p>

    <a id="page424"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Hello, hon,” whispered a smoky female voice, over his shoulder.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hello,” he said, turning to face her.</p>

    <p class="normal">She had brown hair and brown skin and her eyes were the deep golden-amber of good honey. Her pupils were vertical slits. “Do I know you?” he asked, puzzled.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Intimately,” she said, and she smiled. “I used to sleep on your bed. And my people have been keeping their eyes on you, for me.” She turned to the path ahead of him, pointed to the three ways he could go. “Okay,” she said. “One way will make you wise. One way will make you whole. And one way will kill you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m already dead, I think,” said Shadow. “I died on the tree.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She made a moue. “There’s dead,” she said, “and there’s dead, and there’s dead. It’s a relative thing.” Then she smiled again. “I could make a joke about that, you know. Something about dead relatives.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Shadow. “It’s okay.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“So,” she said. “Which way do you want to go?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” he admitted.</p>

    <p class="normal">She tipped her head on one side, a perfectly feline gesture. Suddenly, Shadow knew exactly who she was, and where he knew her from. He felt himself beginning to blush. “If you trust me,” said Bast, “I can choose for you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I trust you,” he said, without hesitation.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Do you want to know what it’s going to cost you?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ve already lost my name,” he told her.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Names come and names go. Was it worth it?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes. Maybe. It wasn’t easy. As revelations go, it was kind of personal.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“All revelations are personal,” she said. “That’s why all revelations are suspect.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I don’t understand.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” she said, “you don’t. I’ll take your heart. We’ll need it later,” and she reached her hand deep inside his chest, and she pulled it out with something ruby and pulsing held between her sharp fingernails. It was the color of pigeon’s blood, and it was made of pure light. Rhythmically it expanded and contracted.</p>

    <p class="normal">She closed her hand, and it was gone.</p>

    <a id="page425"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Take the middle way,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow hesitated. “Are you really here?” he asked.</p>

    <p class="normal">She tipped her head on one side, regarded him gravely, said nothing at all.</p>

    <p class="normal">“What are you?” he asked. “What <span class="italic">are</span> you people?”</p>

    <p class="normal">She yawned, showing a perfect, dark-pink tongue. “Think of us as symbols—we’re the dream that humanity creates to make sense of the shadows on the cave wall. Now go on, keep moving. Your body is already growing cold. The fools are gathering on the mountain. The clock is ticking.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow nodded, and walked on.</p>

    <p class="normal">The path was becoming slippery now. There was ice on the rock. Shadow stumbled and skidded as he walked down the rock path, toward the place where it divided, scraping his knuckles on a jut of rock at chest height. He edged forward as slowly as he could. The moon above him glittered through the ice-crystals in the air: there was a ring about the moon, a moonbow, diffusing the light. It was beautiful, but it made walking harder. The path was unreliable.</p>

    <p class="normal">He reached the place where the path divided.</p>

    <p class="normal">He looked at the first path with a feeling of recognition. It opened into a vast chamber, or a set of chambers, like a dark museum. He knew it already. He had been there once, although for several moments he was unable to remember where or when. He could hear the long echoes of tiny noises. He could hear the noise that the dust makes as it settles.</p>

    <p class="normal">It was the place that he had dreamed of, that first night that Laura had come to him, in the motel, so long ago; the endless memorial hall to the gods that were forgotten, and the ones whose very existence had been lost.</p>

    <p class="normal">He took a step backward.</p>

    <p class="normal">He walked to the path on the far side, and looked ahead. There was a Disneyland quality to the corridor: black Plexiglas walls with lights set in them. The colored lights blinked and flashed in the illusion of order, for no particular reason, like the console lights on a television starship.</p>

    <p class="normal">He could hear something there as well: a deep vibrating bass drone which Shadow could feel in the pit of his stomach.</p>

    <p class="normal">He stopped and looked around. Neither way seemed right. Not any <a id="page426"></a>longer. He was done with paths. The middle way, the way the cat-woman had told him to walk, that was his way. He moved toward it.</p>

    <p class="normal">The moon above him was beginning to fade: the edge of it was pinking and going into eclipse. The path was framed by a huge doorway.</p>

    <p class="normal">There were no deals to make any more, no more bargains. There was nothing to do but enter. So Shadow walked through the doorway, in darkness. The air was warm, and it smelled of wet dust, like a city street after the summer’s first rain.</p>

    <p class="normal">He was not afraid.</p>

    <p class="normal">Not any more. Fear had died on the tree, as Shadow had died. There was no fear left, no hatred, no pain. Nothing left but essence.</p>

    <p class="normal">Something big splashed, quietly, in the distance, and the splash echoed into the vastness. He squinted, but could see nothing. It was too dark. And then, from the direction of the splashes, a ghost-light glimmered and the world took form: he was in a cavern, and in front of him, mirror-smooth, was water.</p>

    <p class="normal">The splashing noises came closer and the light became brighter, and Shadow waited on the shore. Soon enough a low, flat boat came into sight, a flickering white lantern burning at its raised prow, another reflected in the glassy black water several feet below it. The boat was being poled by a tall figure, and the splashing noise Shadow had heard was the sound of the pole being lifted and moved as it pushed the craft across the waters of the underground lake.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hello there!” called Shadow. Echoes of his words suddenly surrounded him: he could imagine that a whole chorus of people were welcoming him, and calling to him, and each of them had his voice.</p>

    <p class="normal">The person poling the boat made no reply.</p>

    <p class="normal">The boat’s pilot was tall, and very thin. He—if it was a he—wore an unadorned white robe, and the pale head that topped it was so utterly inhuman that Shadow was certain that it had to be a mask of some sort: it was a bird’s head, small on a long neck, its beak long and high. Shadow was certain he had seen it before, this ghostly, bird-like figure. He grasped at the memory and then, disappointed, realized that he was picturing the clockwork penny-in-the-slot machine in the House on the Rock, and the pale, bird-like, half-glimpsed figure that glided out from behind the crypt for the drunkard’s soul.</p>

    <a id="page427"></a> 

    <p class="normal">Water dripped and echoed from the pole and the prow, and the ship’s wake rippled the glassy waters. The boat was made of reeds, bound and tied.</p>

    <p class="normal">The boat came close to the shore. The pilot leaned on its pole. Its head turned slowly, until it was facing Shadow. “Hello,” it said, without moving its long beak. The voice was male, and, like everything else in Shadow’s afterlife so far, familiar. “Come on board. You’ll get your feet wet, I’m afraid, but there’s not a thing can be done about that. These are old boats, and if I come in closer I could rip out the bottom.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow took off the shoes he had not been aware he was wearing, and stepped out into the water. It came halfway up his calves, and was, after the initial shock of wetness, surprisingly warm. He reached the boat, and the pilot put down a hand, and pulled him aboard. The reed boat rocked a little, and water splashed over the low sides of it, and then it steadied.</p>

    <p class="normal">The pilot poled off away from the shore. Shadow stood there and watched, his pants-legs dripping.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I know you,” he said to the creature at the prow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You do indeed,” said the boatman. The oil lamp which hung at the front of the boat burned more fitfully, and the smoke from the lamp made Shadow cough. “You worked for me. I’m afraid we had to inter Lila Goodchild without you.” The voice was fussy and precise.</p>

    <p class="normal">The smoke stung Shadow’s eyes. He wiped the tears away with his hand, and, through the smoke, he thought he saw a tall man, in a suit, with gold-rimmed spectacles. The smoke cleared and the boatman was once more a half-human creature with the head of a river-bird.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Mister Ibis?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Good to see you, Shadow,” said the creature, with Mr. Ibis’s voice. “Do you know what a <span class="italic">psychopomp</span> is?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow thought he knew the word, but it had been a long time. He shook his head.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s a fancy term for an escort,” said Mr. Ibis. “We all have so many functions, so many ways of existing. In my own vision of myself, I am a scholar who lives quietly, and pens his little tales, and dreams about a past that may or may not ever have existed. And that is true, as far as it goes. But I am also, in one of my capacities, like so many of the people <a id="page428"></a>you have chosen to associate with, a psychopomp. I escort the living to the world of the dead.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I thought this was the world of the dead,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“No. Not per se. It’s more of a preliminary.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The boat slipped and slid across the mirror-surface of the underground pool. The bird-head of the creature at the prow stared ahead. And then Mr. Ibis said, without moving its beak, “You people talk about the living and the dead as if they were two mutually exclusive categories. As if you cannot have a river that is also a road, or a song that is also a color.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You can’t,” said Shadow. “Can you?” The echoes whispered his words back at him from across the pool.</p>

    <p class="normal">“What you have to remember,” said Mr. Ibis, testily, “is that life and death are different sides of the same coin. Like the heads and tails of a quarter.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And if I had a double-headed quarter?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You don’t. They only belong to fools, and gods.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow had a frisson, then, as they crossed the dark water. He imagined he could see the faces of children staring up at him reproachfully from beneath the water’s glassy surface: their faces were waterlogged and softened, their blind eyes clouded. There was no wind in that underground cavern to disturb the black surface of the lake.</p>

    <p class="normal">“So I’m dead,” said Shadow. He was getting used to the idea. “Or I’m going to be dead.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“We are on our way to the Hall of the Dead. I requested that I be the one to come for you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Why?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m a psychopomp. I like you. You were a hard worker. Why not?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Because…” Shadow marshaled his thoughts. “Because I never believed in you. Because I don’t know much about Egyptian mythology. Because I didn’t expect this. What happened to Saint Peter and the Pearly Gates?”</p>

    <p class="normal">The long-beaked white head shook from side to side, gravely. “It doesn’t matter that you didn’t believe in us,” said Mr. Ibis. “We believed in you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The boat touched bottom. Mr. Ibis stepped off the side, into the pool, <a id="page429"></a>and told Shadow to do the same. Mr. Ibis took a line from the prow of the boat, and passed Shadow the lantern to carry. It was in the shape of a crescent moon. They walked ashore, and Mr. Ibis tied the boat to a metal ring set in the rock floor. Then he took the lamp from Shadow and walked swiftly forward, holding the lamp high as he walked, throwing vast shadows across the rock floor and the high rock walls.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Are you scared?” asked Mr. Ibis.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Not really.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Well, try to cultivate the emotions of true awe and spiritual terror, as we walk. They are the appropriate feelings for the situation at hand.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow was not scared. He was interested, and apprehensive, but no more. He was not scared of the shifting darkness, nor of being dead, nor even of the dog-headed creature the size of a grain silo who stared at them as they approached. It growled, deep in its throat, and Shadow felt his neck-hairs prickle.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Shadow,” it said. “Now is the time of judgment.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow looked up at the creature. “Mister Jacquel?” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">The hands of Anubis came down, huge dark hands, and they picked Shadow up and brought him close.</p>

    <p class="normal">The jackal head examined him with bright and glittering eyes; examined him as dispassionately as Mr. Jacquel had examined the dead girl on the slab. Shadow knew that all his faults, all his failings, all his weaknesses were being taken out and weighed and measured; that he was, in some way, being dissected, and sliced, and tasted.</p>

    <p class="normal">We do not always remember the things that do no credit to us. We justify them, cover them in bright lies or with the thick dust of forgetfulness. All of the things that Shadow had done in his life of which he was not proud, all the things he wished he had done otherwise or left undone, came at him then in a swirling storm of guilt and regret and shame, and he had nowhere to hide from them. He was as naked and as open as a corpse on a table, and dark Anubis the jackal god was his prosector and his prosecutor and his persecutor.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Please,” said Shadow. “Please stop.”</p>

    <p class="normal">But the examination did not stop. Every lie he had ever told, every object he had stolen, every hurt he had inflicted on another person, all the little crimes and the tiny murders that make up the day, each of these <a id="page430"></a>things and more were extracted and held up to the light by the jackal-headed judge of the dead.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow began to weep, painfully, in the palm of the dark god’s hand. He was a tiny child again, as helpless and as powerless as he had ever been.</p>

    <p class="normal">And then, without warning, it was over. Shadow panted, and sobbed, and snot streamed from his nose; he still felt helpless, but the hands placed him, carefully, almost tenderly, down on the rock floor.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Who has his heart?” growled Anubis.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I do,” purred a woman’s voice. Shadow looked up. Bast was standing there beside the thing that was no longer Mr. Ibis, and she held Shadow’s heart in her right hand. It lit her face with a ruby light.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Give it to me,” said Thoth, the ibis-headed god, and he took the heart in his hands, which were not human hands, and he glided forward.</p>

    <p class="normal">Anubis placed a pair of golden scales in front of him.</p>

    <p class="normal">“So is this where we find out what I get?” whispered Shadow to Bast. “Heaven? Hell? Purgatory?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“If the feather balances,” she said, “you get to choose your own destination.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And if not?”</p>

    <p class="normal">She shrugged, as if the subject made her uncomfortable. Then she said, “Then we feed your heart and your soul to Ammet, the Eater of Souls…”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe I can get some kind of a happy ending.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Not only are there no happy endings,” she told him. “There aren’t even any endings.”</p>

    <p class="normal">On one of the pans of the scales, carefully, reverently, Anubis placed a feather.</p>

    <p class="normal">Anubis put Shadow’s heart on the other pan of the scales. Something moved in the shadows under the scale, something it made Shadow uncomfortable to examine too closely.</p>

    <p class="normal">It was a heavy feather, but Shadow had a heavy heart, and the scales tipped and swung worryingly.</p>

    <p class="normal">But they balanced, in the end, and the creature in the shadows skulked away, unsatisfied.</p>

    <p class="normal">“So that’s that,” said Bast, wistfully. “Just another skull for the pile. <a id="page431"></a>It’s a pity. I had hoped that you would do some good, in the current troubles. It’s like watching a slow-motion car crash and being powerless to prevent it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You won’t be there?”</p>

    <p class="normal">She shook her head. “I don’t like other people picking my battles for me,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was silence then, in the vasty hall of death, where it echoed of water and the dark.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said, “So now I get to choose where I go next?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Choose,” said Thoth. “Or we can choose for you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Shadow. “It’s okay. It’s my choice.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Well?” roared Anubis.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I want to rest now,” said Shadow. “That’s what I want. I want nothing. No heaven, no hell, no anything. Just let it end.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You’re certain?” asked Thoth.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Jacquel opened the last door for Shadow, and behind that door there was nothing. Not darkness. Not even oblivion. Only nothing.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow accepted it, completely and without reservation, and he walked through the door into nothing with a strange fierce joy.</p>
