    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>hey changed cars at five in the morning, in Minneapolis, in the airport’s long-term parking lot. They drove to the top floor, where the parking building was open to the sky.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow took the orange uniform and the handcuffs and leg hobbles, put them in the brown paper bag that had briefly held his possessions, folded the whole thing up and dropped it into a parking lot garbage can. They had been waiting for ten minutes when a barrel-chested young man came out of an airport door and walked over to them. He was eating a packet of Burger King french fries. Shadow recognized him immediately: he had sat in the back of the car when they had left the House on the Rock, and hummed so deeply the car had vibrated. He now sported a white-streaked winter beard he had not had when they had met at the House on the Rock. It made him look older.</p>

    <p class="normal">The man wiped the grease from his hands onto his sweater, extended one huge hand to Shadow. “I heard of the all-father’s death,” he said. “They will pay, and they will pay dearly.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Wednesday was your father?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“He was the all-father,” said the man. His deep voice caught in his throat. “You tell them, tell them all, that when we are needed my people will be there.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog picked at a flake of tobacco between his teeth and spat it out onto the frozen slush. “And how many of you is that? Ten? Twenty?”</p>

    <a id="page376"></a> 

    <p class="normal">The barrel-chested man’s beard bristled. “And aren’t ten of us worth a hundred of them? Who would stand against even one of my folk, in a battle? But there are more of us than that, at the edges of the cities. There are a few in the mountains. Some in the Catskills, a few living in the carny towns in Florida. They keep their axes sharp. They will come if I call them.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You do that, Elvis,” said Mr. Nancy. Shadow thought he said Elvis, anyway, but he couldn’t be sure. Nancy had exchanged the deputy’s uniform for a thick brown cardigan, corduroy trousers, and brown loafers. “You call them. It’s what the old bastard would have wanted.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“They betrayed him. They killed him. I laughed at Wednesday, but I was wrong. None of us are safe any longer,” said the man who might have been named Elvis. “But you can rely on us.” He gently patted Shadow on the back and almost sent him sprawling. It was like being gently patted on the back by a wrecking ball.</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog had been looking around the parking lot. Now he said, “You will pardon me asking, but our new vehicle is which?”</p>

    <p class="normal">The barrel-chested man pointed. “There she is,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog snorted. “That?”</p>

    <p class="normal">It was a 1970 VW bus. There was a rainbow decal in the rear window.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s a fine vehicle. And it’s the last thing that they’ll be expecting you to be driving. The last thing they’ll be looking for.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog walked around the vehicle. Then he started to cough, a lung-rumbling, old-man, five-in-the-morning, smoker’s cough. He hawked, and spat, and put his hand to his chest, massaging away the pain. “Yes. The last car they will suspect. So what happens when the police pull us over, looking for the hippies, and the dope? Eh? We are not here to ride the magic bus. We are to blend in.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The bearded man unlocked the door of the bus. “So they take a look at you, they see you aren’t hippies, they wave you goodbye. It’s the perfect disguise. And it’s all I could find at no notice.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog seemed to be ready to argue it further, but Mr. Nancy intervened smoothly. “Elvis, you come through for us. We are very grateful. Now, that car needs to get back to Chicago.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“We’ll leave it in Bloomington,” said the bearded man. “The wolves <a id="page377"></a>will take care of it. Don’t give it another thought.” He turned back to Shadow. “Again, you have my sympathy and I share your pain. Good luck. And if the vigil falls to you, my admiration, and my sympathy.” He squeezed Shadow’s hand in sympathy and in friendship with his own catcher’s-mitt fist. It hurt. “You tell his corpse when you see it. Tell him that Alviss son of Vindalf will keep the faith.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The VW bus smelled of patchouli, of old incense and rolling tobacco. There was a faded pink carpet glued to the floor and to the walls.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Who was that?” asked Shadow, as he drove them down the ramp, grinding the gears.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Just like he said, Alviss son of Vindalf. He’s the king of the dwarfs. The biggest, mightiest, greatest of all the dwarf folk.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“But he’s not a dwarf,” pointed out Shadow. “He’s what, five eight? Five nine?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Which makes him a giant among dwarfs,” said Czernobog from behind him. “Tallest dwarf in America.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“What was that about the vigil?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">The two old men said nothing. Shadow glanced to his right. Mr. Nancy was staring out of the window.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Well? He was talking about a vigil. You heard him.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog spoke up from the back seat. “You will not have to do it,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Do what?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“The vigil. He talks too much. All the dwarfs talk and talk and talk. And sing. All the time, sing, sing, sing. Is nothing to think of. Better you put it out of your mind.”</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>hey drove south, keeping off the freeways (“We must assume,” said Mr. Nancy, “that they are in enemy hands. Or that they are perhaps enemy hands in their own right”). Driving south was like driving forward in time. The snows erased, slowly, and were completely gone by the following morning when the bus reached Kentucky. Winter was already over in Kentucky, and spring was on its way. Shadow began to wonder if there were some kind of equation to explain it—perhaps every fifty miles he drove south he was driving a day into the future.</p>

    <p class="normal">He would have mentioned his idea to his passengers, but Mr. Nancy <a id="page378"></a>was asleep in the passenger seat in the front, while Czernobog snored unceasingly in the back.</p>

    <p class="normal">Time seemed a flexible construct at that moment, an illusion he was imagining as he drove. He found himself becoming painfully aware of birds and animals: he saw the crows on the side of the road, or in the bus’s path, picking at roadkill; flights of birds wheeled across the skies in patterns that almost made sense; cats stared at them from front lawns and fence-posts.</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog snorted and woke, sitting up slowly. “I dreamed a strange dream,” he said. “I dreamed that I am truly Bielebog. That forever the world imagines that there are two of us, the light god and the dark, but that now we are both old, I find it was only me all the time, giving them gifts, taking my gifts away.” He broke the filter from a Lucky Strike, put it between his lips and lit it with his lighter.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow wound down his window.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Aren’t you worried about lung cancer?” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I <span class="italic">am</span> cancer,” said Czernobog. “I do not frighten myself.” He chuckled, and then the chuckle became a wheeze and the wheeze turned into a cough.</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy spoke. “Folk like us don’t get cancer. We don’t get arteriosclerosis or Parkinson’s disease or syphilis. We’re kind of hard to kill.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“They killed Wednesday,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">He pulled over for gas, and then parked next door at a restaurant, for an early breakfast. As they entered, the payphone in the entrance began to jangle. They walked past it without answering it, and it stopped ringing.</p>

    <p class="normal">They gave their orders to an elderly woman with a worried smile, who had been sitting reading a paperback copy of <span class="italic">What My Heart Meant</span> by Jenny Kerton. The telephone began to ring once more. The woman sighed, then walked back and over to the phone, picked it up, said, “Yes.” Then she looked back at the room, said, “Yep. Looks like they are. You just hold the line now,” and walked over to Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s for you,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Okay,” said Mr. Nancy. “Now, ma’am, you make sure those fries are real <span class="italic">crisp</span> now. Think burnt.” He walked over to the payphone.</p>

    <p class="normal">“This is he,” he said.</p>

    <a id="page379"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“And what makes you think I’m dumb enough to trust you?” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I can find it,” he said. “I know where it is.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” he said. “We want it. You know we want it. And I know you want to get rid of it. So don’t give me any shit.”</p>

    <p class="normal">He put down the telephone, came back to the table.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Who was it?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Didn’t say.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“What did they want?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“They were offerin’ us a truce, while they hand over the body.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“They lie,” said Czernobog. “They want to lure us in, and then they will kill us. What they did to Wednesday. Is what I always used to do,” he added, with gloomy pride. “Promise them anything, but do what you will.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s on neutral territory,” said Nancy. “Truly neutral.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog chuckled. It sounded like a metal ball rattling in a dry skull. “I used to say <span class="italic">that</span> also. Come to a neutral place, I would say, and then in the night we would rise up and kill them all. Those were the good days.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy shrugged. He crunched down on his dark brown french fries, grinned his approval. “Mm-mm. These are fine fries,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“We can’t trust those people,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Listen, I’m older than you and I’m smarter than you and I’m better lookin’ than you,” said Mr. Nancy, thumping the bottom of the ketchup bottle, blobbing ketchup over his burnt fries. “I can get more pussy in an afternoon than you’ll get in a year. I can dance like an angel, fight like a cornered bear, plan better than a fox, sing like a nightingale…”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And your point here is…?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy’s brown eyes gazed into Shadow’s. “And they need to get rid of the body as much as we need to take it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog said, “There is no such neutral place.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“There’s one,” said Mr. Nancy. “It’s the center.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog shook his head abruptly. “No. They would not meet us there. They can do nothing to us, there. It is a bad place for all of us.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“That’s just why they’ve proposed to make the handover at the center.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog seemed to think about this for a while. And then he said, “Perhaps.”</p>

    <a id="page380"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“When we get back on the road,” said Shadow, “you can drive. I need to sleep.”</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">D</span></span>etermining the exact center of anything can be problematic at best. With living things—people, for example, or continents—the problem becomes one of intangibles: What is the center of a man? What is the center of a dream? And in the case of the continental United States, should one count Alaska when one attempts to find the center? Or Hawaii?</p>

    <p class="normal">As the twentieth century began, they made a huge model of the USA, the lower forty-eight states, out of cardboard, and to find the center they balanced it on a pin, until they found the single place it balanced.</p>

    <p class="normal">Near as anyone could figure it out, the exact center of the continental United States was several miles from Lebanon, in Smith County, Kansas, on Johnny Grib’s hog farm. By the 1930s, the people of Lebanon were all ready to put a monument up in the middle of the hog farm, but Johnny Grib said that he didn’t want millions of tourists coming in and tramping all over and upsetting the hogs, and the locals figured he had a point, so they put the monument to the geographical center of the United States two miles north of the town. They built a park, and a stone monument to put in the park, and put a brass plaque to go on the monument to tell you that you were indeed looking at the exact geographic center of the United States of America. They blacktopped the road from the town to the little park, and, certain of the influx of tourists just waiting to come to Lebanon, they even built a motel by the monument. They brought in a little mobile chapel as well, and took off the wheels. Then they waited for the tourists and the holidaymakers to come: all the people who wanted to tell the world they’d been at the center of America, and marveled, and prayed.</p>

    <p class="normal">The tourists did not come. Nobody came.</p>

    <p class="normal">It’s a sad little park, now, with a mobile chapel in it a little bigger than an ice-fishing hut that wouldn’t fit a small funeral party, and a motel whose windows look like dead eyes.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Which is why,” concluded Mr. Nancy, as they drove into Humansville, Missouri (pop. 1,084), “the exact center of America is a tiny run-down park, an empty church, a pile of stones, and a derelict motel.”</p>

    <a id="page381"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Hog farm,” said Czernobog. “You just said that the real center of America was a hog farm.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“This isn’t about what is,” said Mr. Nancy. “It’s about what people <span class="italic">think</span> is. It’s all imaginary anyway. That’s why it’s important. People only fight over imaginary things.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“My kind of people?” asked Shadow. “Or your kind of people?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy said nothing. Czernobog made a noise that might have been a chuckle, might have been a snort.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow tried to get comfortable in the back of the bus. He had slept a little, but only a little. He had a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach. Worse than the feeling he had had in prison, worse than the feeling he had had back when Laura had come to him and told him about the robbery. This was bad. The back of his neck prickled, he felt sick and, several times, in waves, he felt scared.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy pulled over in Humansville, parked outside a supermarket. Mr. Nancy went inside, and Shadow followed him in. Czernobog waited in the parking lot, stretching his legs, smoking his cigarette.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was a young fair-haired man, little more than a boy, restocking the breakfast cereal shelves.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hey,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hey,” said the young man. “It’s true, isn’t it? They killed him?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” said Mr. Nancy. “They killed him.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The young man banged several boxes of Cap’n Crunch down on the shelf. “They think they can crush us like cockroaches,” he said. He had an eruption of acne across one cheek and over his forehead. He had a silver bracelet high on one forearm. “We don’t crush that easy, do we?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Mr. Nancy. “We don’t.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ll be there, sir,” said the young man, his pale blue eyes blazing.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I know you will, Gwydion,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy bought several large bottles of RC Cola, a six-pack of toilet paper, a pack of evil-looking black cigarillos, a bunch of bananas and a pack of Doublemint chewing gum. “He’s a good boy. Came over in the seventh century. Welsh.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The bus meandered first to the west and then to the north. Spring faded back into the dead end of winter. Kansas was the cheerless gray of lonesome clouds, empty windows and lost hearts. Shadow had become <a id="page382"></a>adept at hunting for radio stations, negotiating between Mr. Nancy, who liked talk radio and dance music, and Czernobog, who favored classical music, the gloomier the better, leavened with the more extreme evangelical religious stations. For himself, Shadow liked oldies stations.</p>

    <p class="normal">Toward the end of the afternoon they stopped, at Czernobog’s request, on the outskirts of Cherryvale, Kansas (pop. 2,464). Czernobog led them to a meadow outside the town. There were still traces of snow in the shadows of the trees, and the grass was the color of dirt.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Wait here,” said Czernobog.</p>

    <p class="normal">He walked, alone, to the center of the meadow. He stood there, in the winds of the end of February, for some time. At first he hung his head, then he began gesticulating.</p>

    <p class="normal">“He looks like he’s talking to someone,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Ghosts,” said Mr. Nancy. “They worshiped him here, over a hundred years ago. They made blood-sacrifice to him, libations spilled with the hammer. After a time, the townsfolk figured out why so many of the strangers who passed through the town didn’t ever come back. This was where they hid some of the bodies.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog came back from the middle of the field. His moustache seemed darker now, and there were streaks of black in his gray hair. He smiled, showing his iron tooth. “I feel good, now. Ahh. Some things linger, and blood lingers longest.”</p>

    <p class="normal">They walked back across the meadow to where they had parked the VW bus. Czernobog lit a cigarette, but did not cough. “They did it with the hammer,” he said. “Grimnir, he would talk of the gallows and the spear, but for me, it is one thing…” He reached out a nicotine-colored finger and tapped it, hard, in the center of Shadow’s forehead.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Please don’t do that,” said Shadow, politely.</p>

    <p class="normal">“<span class="italic">Please don’t do that,</span>” mimicked Czernobog. “One day I will take my hammer and do much worse than that to you, my friend, remember?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” said Shadow. “But if you tap my head again, I’ll break your hand.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog snorted. Then he said, “They should be grateful, the people here. There was such power raised. Even thirty years after they forced my people into hiding, this land, this very land, gave us the greatest movie star of all time. She was the greatest there ever was.”</p>

    <a id="page383"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Judy Garland?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog shook his head curtly.</p>

    <p class="normal">“He’s talking about Louise Brooks,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow decided not to ask who Louise Brooks was. Instead he said, “So, look, when Wednesday went to talk to them, he did it under a truce.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And now we’re going to get Wednesday’s body from them, as a truce.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And we know that they want me dead or out of the way.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“They want all of us dead,” said Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“So what I don’t get is, why do we think they’ll play fair this time, when they didn’t for Wednesday?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“That,” said Czernobog, overenunciating each word, as he would for a deaf foreign idiot child, “is why we are meeting at the center. Is…” He frowned. “What is the word for it? The opposite of sacred?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Profane,” said Shadow, without thinking.</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Czernobog. “I mean, when a place is less sacred than any other place. Of negative sacredness. Places where they can build no temples. Places where people will not come, and will leave as soon as they can. Places where gods only walk if they are forced to.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” said Shadow. “I don’t think there is a word for it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“All of America has it, a little,” said Czernobog. “That is why we are not welcome here. But the center,” said Czernobog. “The center is worst. Is like a minefield. We all tread too carefully there to dare break the truce.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I told you all this already,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Whatever,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">They had reached the bus. Czernobog patted Shadow’s upper arm. “You don’t worry,” he said, with gloomy reassurance. “Nobody else is going to kill you. Nobody but me.”</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">S</span></span>hadow found the center of America at evening that same day, before it was fully dark. It was on a slight hill to the northwest of Lebanon. He drove around the little hillside park, past the tiny mobile chapel and the stone monument, and when Shadow saw the one-story 1950s motel at <a id="page384"></a>the edge of the park his heart sank. There was a huge black car parked in front of it—a Humvee, which looked like a jeep reflected in a fun-house mirror, as squat and pointless and ugly as an armored car. There were no lights on in the building</p>

    <p class="normal">They parked beside the motel, and as they did so, a man in a chauffeur’s uniform and cap walked out of the motel and was illuminated by the headlights of the bus. He touched his cap to them, politely, got into the Humvee, and drove off.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Big car, tiny dick,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Do you think they’ll even have beds here?” asked Shadow. “It’s been days since I slept in a bed. This place looks like it’s just waiting to be demolished.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s owned by hunters from Texas,” said Mr. Nancy. “Come up here once a year. Damned if I know what they’re huntin’. It stops the place being condemned and destroyed.”</p>

    <p class="normal">They climbed out of the bus. Waiting for them in front of the motel was a woman Shadow did not recognize. She was perfectly made-up, perfectly coiffed. She reminded him of every newscaster he’d ever seen on morning television sitting in a studio that didn’t really resemble a living room, smiling at the good morning crowd.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Lovely to see you,” she said. “Now, <span class="italic">you</span> must be Czernobog. I’ve heard a lot about you. And <span class="italic">you’re</span> Anansi, always up to mischief, eh? You <span class="italic">jolly</span> old man. And you, you <span class="italic">must</span> be Shadow. You’ve certainly led us a merry chase, haven’t <span class="italic">you</span>?” A hand took his, pressed it firmly, looked him straight in the eye. “I’m Media. Good to meet you. I hope we can get this evening’s business done as <span class="italic">pleasantly</span> as possible.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The main doors opened. “Somehow, Toto,” said the fat kid Shadow had last seen sitting in a limo, “I don’t believe we’re in Kansas any more.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“We’re in Kansas,” said Mr. Nancy. “I think we must have driven through most of it today. Damn but this country is flat.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“This place has no lights, no power, and no hot water,” said the fat kid. “And, no offense, you people really need the hot water. You just smell like you’ve been in that bus for a week.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I don’t think there’s <span class="italic">any</span> need to go there,” said the woman, smoothly. “We’re all friends here. Come on in. We’ll show you to your rooms. <span class="italic">We</span> took the first four rooms. Your late friend is in the fifth. All the ones be<a id="page385"></a>yond room five are empty—you can take your pick. I’m afraid it’s <span class="italic">not</span> the Four Seasons, but then, what <span class="italic">is</span>?”</p>

    <p class="normal">She opened the door to the motel lobby for them. It smelled of mildew, of damp and dust and of decay.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was a man sitting in the lobby, in the near darkness. “You people hungry?” he asked.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I can always eat,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Driver’s gone out for a sack of hamburgers,” said the man. “He’ll be back soon.” He looked up. It was too dark to see faces, but he said, “Big guy. You’re Shadow, huh? The asshole who killed Woody and Stone?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Shadow. “That was someone else. And I know who you are.” He did. He had been inside the man’s head. “You’re Town. Have you slept with Wood’s widow yet?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Town fell off his chair. In a movie, it would have been funny; in real life it was simply clumsy. He stood up quickly, came toward Shadow. Shadow looked down at him, and said, “Don’t start anything you’re not prepared to finish.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy rested his hand on Shadow’s upper arm. “Truce, remember?” he said. “We’re at the center.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Town turned away, leaned over to the counter and picked up three keys. “You’re down at the end of the hall,” he said. “Here.”</p>

    <p class="normal">He handed the keys to Mr. Nancy and walked away, into the shadows of the corridor. They heard a motel room door open, and they heard it slam.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy passed a key to Shadow, another to Czernobog. “Is there a flashlight on the bus?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Mr. Nancy. “But it’s just dark. You mustn’t be afraid of the dark.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m not,” said Shadow. “I’m afraid of the people in the dark.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Dark is good,” said Czernobog. He seemed to have no difficulty seeing where he was going, leading them down the darkened corridor, putting the keys into the locks without fumbling. “I will be in room ten,” he told them. And then he said, “Media. I think I have heard of her. Isn’t she the one who killed her children?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Different woman,” said Mr. Nancy. “Same deal.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy was in room eight, and Shadow opposite the two of them, <a id="page386"></a>in room nine. The room smelled damp, and dusty, and deserted. There was a bed-frame in there, with a mattress on it, but no sheets. A little light entered the room from the gloaming outside the window. Shadow sat down on the mattress, pulled off his shoes, and stretched out at full length. He had driven too much in the last few days.</p>

    <p class="normal">Perhaps he slept.</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">H</span></span></span><span class="italic">e was walking.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">A cold wind tugged at his clothes. The tiny snowflakes were little more than a crystalline dust which gusted and flurried in the wind.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">There were trees, bare of leaves in the winter. There were high hills on each side of him. It was late on a winter’s afternoon: the sky and the snow had attained the same deep shade of purple. Somewhere ahead of him—in this light, distances were impossible to judge—the flames of a bonfire flickered, yellow and orange.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">A gray wolf padded through the snow before him.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">Shadow stopped. The wolf stopped also, and turned, and waited. One of its eyes glinted yellowish-green. Shadow shrugged and walked toward the flames and the wolf ambled ahead of him.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">The bonfire burned in the middle of a grove of trees. There must have been a hundred trees, planted in two rows. There were shapes hanging from the trees. At the end of the rows was a building that looked a little like an overturned boat. It was carved of wood, and it crawled with wooden creatures and wooden faces—dragons, gryphons, trolls and boars—all of them dancing in the flickering light of the fire.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">The bonfire was so high, and burning so hard, that Shadow could barely approach it. The wolf seemed unfazed, and it padded around the crackling fire.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">He waited for it to return, but in place of the wolf a man walked back around the fire. He was leaning on a tall stick.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“You are in Uppsala, in Sweden,” said the man, in a familiar, gravelly voice. “About a thousand years ago.”</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“Wednesday?” said Shadow.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">The man who might have been Wednesday continued to talk, as if Shadow was not there. “First every year, then, later, when the rot set in, and they became lax, every nine years, they would sacrifice here. A sacrifice of nines. Each day, for nine days, they would hang nine animals from trees in the grove. One of those animals was always a man.”</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">He strode away from the firelight, toward the trees, and Shadow followed him. <a id="page387"></a>As he approached the trees the shapes that hung from them resolved: legs and eyes and tongues and heads. Shadow shook his head: there was something about seeing a bull hanging by its neck from a tree that was darkly sad, and at the same time surreal enough almost to be funny. Shadow passed a hanging stag, a wolfhound, a brown bear, and a chestnut horse with a white mane, little bigger than a pony. The dog was still alive: every few seconds it would kick spasmodically, and it was making a strained whimpering noise, as it dangled from the rope.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">The man he was following took his long stick, which Shadow realized now, as it moved, was actually a spear, and he slashed at the dog’s stomach with it, in one knife-like cut downward. Steaming entrails tumbled onto the snow. “I dedicate this death to Odin,” said the man, formally.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“It is only a gesture,” he said, turning back to Shadow. “But gestures mean everything. The death of one dog symbolizes the death of all dogs. Nine men they gave to me, but they stood for all the men, all the blood, all the power. It just wasn’t enough. One day, the blood stopped flowing. Belief without blood only takes us so far. The blood must flow.”</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“I saw you die,” said Shadow.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“In the god business,” said the figure—and now Shadow was certain it was Wednesday, nobody else had that rasp, that deep cynical joy in words, “it’s not the death that matters. It’s the opportunity for resurrection. And when the blood flows…” He gestured at the animals, at the people, hanging from the trees.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">Shadow could not decide whether the dead humans they walked past were more or less horrifying than the animals: at least the humans had known the fate they were going to. There was a deep, boozy smell about the men that suggested that they had been allowed to anaesthetize themselves on their way to the gallows, while the animals would simply have been lynched, hauled up alive and terrified. The faces of the men looked so young: none of them was older than twenty.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“Who am I?” asked Shadow.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“You are a diversion,” said the man. “You were an opportunity. You gave the whole affair an air of credibility I would have been hard put to deliver solo. Although both of us are committed enough to the affair to die for it. Eh?”</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“Who are you?” asked Shadow.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“The hardest part is simply surviving,” said the man. The bonfire—and Shadow realized with a strange horror that it truly was a bone-fire: ribcages and fire-eyed skulls stared and stuck and jutted from the flames, sputtering trace-element colors into the night, greens and yellows and blues—was flaring and crackling and burning <a id="page388"></a>hotly. “Three days on the tree, three days in the underworld, three days to find my way back.”</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">The flames sputtered and flared too brightly for Shadow to look at directly. He looked down into the darkness beneath the trees.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">There was no fire, no snow. There were no trees, no hanged bodies, no bloody spear.</span></p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">A</span></span> knock on the door—and now there was moonlight coming in the window. Shadow sat up with a start. “Dinner’s served,” said Media’s voice.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow put his shoes back on, walked over to the door, went out into the corridor. Someone had found some candles, and a dim yellow light illuminated the reception hall. The driver of the Humvee came in through the swing doors holding a cardboard tray and a paper sack. He wore a long black coat and a peaked chauffeur’s cap.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Sorry about the delay,” he said, hoarsely. “I got everybody the same: a couple of burgers, large fries, large Coke, and apple pie. I’ll eat mine out in the car.” He put the food down, then walked back outside. The smell of fast food filled the lobby. Shadow took the paper bag and passed out the food, the napkins, the packets of ketchup.</p>

    <p class="normal">They ate in silence while the candles flickered and the burning wax hissed.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow noticed that Town was glaring at him. He turned his chair a little, so his back was to the wall. Media ate her burger with a napkin poised by her lips to remove crumbs.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Oh. Great. These burgers are nearly cold,” said the fat kid. He was still wearing his shades, which Shadow thought pointless and foolish, given the darkness of the room.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Sorry about that. The guy had to drive a way to find them,” said Town. “The nearest McDonald’s is in Nebraska.”</p>

    <p class="normal">They finished their lukewarm hamburgers and cold fries. The fat kid bit into his single-person apple pie, and the filling spurted down his chin. Unexpectedly, the filling was still hot. “Ow,” he said. He wiped at it with his hand, licking his fingers to get them clean. “That stuff burns!” he said. “Those pies are a class action suit waiting to fucking happen.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow realized he wanted to hit the kid. He’d wanted to hit him <a id="page389"></a>since the kid had his goons hurt him in the limo, after Laura’s funeral. He knew it was not a wise thing to be thinking, not here, not now. “Can’t we just take Wednesday’s body and get out of here?” he asked.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Midnight,” said Mr. Nancy and the fat kid, at the same time.</p>

    <p class="normal">“These things must be done according to the rules,” said Czernobog. “All things have rules.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yeah,” said Shadow. “But nobody tells me what they are. You keep talking about the goddamn rules, I don’t even know what game you people are playing.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s like breaking the street date,” said Media, brightly. “You know. When things are allowed to be on sale.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Town said, “I think the whole thing’s a crock of shit. But if their rules make them happy, then my agency is happy and everybody’s happy.” He slurped his Coke. “Roll on midnight. You take the body, you go away. We’re all lovey-fucking-dovey and we wave you goodbye. And then we can get on with hunting you down like the rats you are.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hey,” said the fat kid to Shadow. “Reminds me. I told you to tell your boss he was history. Did you ever tell him?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I told him,” said Shadow. “And you know what he said to me? He said to tell the little snot, if ever I saw him again, to remember that today’s future is tomorrow’s yesterday.” Wednesday had never said any such thing, but Shadow delivered it as Wednesday would have done. These people seemed to like clichés. The black sunglasses reflected the flickering candle-flames back at him, like eyes.</p>

    <p class="normal">The fat kid said, “This place is such a fucking dump. No power. Out of wireless range. I mean, when you got to be wired, you’re already back in the Stone Age.” He sucked the last of his Coke through the straw, dropped the cup on the table and walked away down the corridor.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow reached over and placed the fat kid’s garbage back into the paper sack. “I’m going to see the center of America,” he announced. He got up and walked outside, into the night. Mr. Nancy followed him. They strolled together, across the little park, saying nothing until they reached the stone monument. The wind gusted at them, fitfully, first from one direction, then from another. “So,” he said. “Now what?”</p>

    <p class="normal">The half-moon hung pale in the dark sky.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Now,” said Nancy, “you should go back to your room. Lock the <a id="page390"></a>door. You try to get some more sleep. At midnight they give us the body. And then we get the hell out of here. The center is not a stable place for anybody.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“If you say so.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy inhaled on his cigarillo. “This should never have happened,” he said. “None of this should have happened. Our kind of people, we are…” he waved the cigarillo about, as if using it to hunt for a word, then stabbing forward with it, “…<span class="italic">exclusive</span>. We’re not social. Not even me. Not even Bacchus. Not for long. We walk by ourselves or we stay in our own little groups. We do not play well with others. We like to be adored and respected and worshiped—me, I like them to be tellin’ tales about me, tales showing my cleverness. It’s a fault, I know, but it’s the way I am. We like to be big. Now, in these shabby days, we are small. The new gods rise and fall and rise again. But this is not a country that tolerates gods for long. Brahma creates, Vishnu preserves, Shiva destroys, and the ground is clear for Brahma to create once more.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“So what are you saying?” asked Shadow. “The fighting’s over, now? The battle’s done?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy snorted. “Are you out of your mind? They killed Wednesday. They killed him and they bragged about it. They spread the word. They’ve showed it on every channel to those with eyes to see it. No, Shadow. It’s only just begun.”</p>

    <p class="normal">He bent down at the foot of the stone monument, stubbed out his cigarillo on the earth, and left it there, like an offering.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You used to make jokes,” said Shadow. “You don’t any more.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s hard to find the jokes these days. Wednesday’s dead. Are you comin’ inside?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Soon.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy walked away, toward the motel. Shadow reached out his hand and touched the monument’s stones. He dragged his big fingers across the cold brass plate. Then he turned and walked over to the tiny white church, walked through the open doorway, into the darkness. He sat down in the nearest pew and closed his eyes and lowered his head, and thought about Laura, and about Wednesday, and about being alive.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was a click from behind him, and a scuff of shoe against earth. Shadow sat up, and turned. Someone stood just outside the open door<a id="page391"></a>way, a dark shape against the stars. Moonlight glinted from something metal.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You going to shoot me?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Jesus—I wish,” said Mr. Town. “It’s only for self-defense. So, you’re praying? Have they got you thinking that they’re gods? They aren’t gods.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I wasn’t praying,” said Shadow. “Just thinking.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“The way I figure it,” said Town, “they’re mutations. Evolutionary experiments. A little hypnotic ability, a little hocus-pocus, and they can make people believe anything. Nothing to write home about. That’s all. They die like men, after all.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“They always did,” said Shadow. He got up, and Town took a step back. Shadow walked out of the little chapel, and Mr. Town kept his distance. “Hey,” Shadow said. “Do you know who Louise Brooks was?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Friend of yours?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Nope. She was a movie star from south of here.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Town paused. “Maybe she changed her name, and became Liz Taylor or Sharon Stone or someone,” he suggested, helpfully.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Maybe.” Shadow started to walk back to the motel. Town kept pace with him.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You should be back in prison,” said Mr. Town. “You should be on fucking death row.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I didn’t kill your associates,” said Shadow. “But I’ll tell you something a guy once told me, back when I was in prison. Something I’ve never forgotten.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And that is?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“There was only one guy in the whole Bible Jesus ever personally promised a place with him in Paradise. Not Peter, not Paul, not any of those guys. He was a convicted thief, being executed. So don’t knock the guys on death row. Maybe they know something you don’t.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The driver stood by the Humvee. “G’night, gentlemen,” he said, as they passed.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Night,” said Mr. Town. And then he said, to Shadow, “I personally don’t give a fuck about any of this. What I do, is what Mr. World says. It’s easier that way.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow walked down the corridor to room nine.</p>

    <a id="page392"></a> 

    <p class="normal">He unlocked the door, went inside. He said, “Sorry. I thought this was my room.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“It is,” said Media. “I was waiting for you.” He could see her hair in the moonlight, and her pale face. She was sitting on his bed, primly.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ll find another room.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I won’t be here for long,” she said. “I just thought it might be an appropriate time to make you an <span class="italic">offer</span>.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Okay. Make the offer.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Relax,” she said. There was a smile in her voice. “You have <span class="italic">such</span> a stick up your butt. Look, Wednesday’s <span class="italic">dead</span>. You don’t owe anyone anything. Throw in with us. Time to Come Over to the Winning Team.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said nothing.</p>

    <p class="normal">“We can make you <span class="italic">famous,</span> Shadow. We can give you power over what people believe and say and wear and dream. You want to be the next Cary Grant? We can make that <span class="italic">happen</span>. We can make you the next Beatles.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I think I preferred it when you were offering to show me Lucy’s tits,” said Shadow. “If that was you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Ah,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I need my room back. Good night.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And then of course,” she said, not moving, as if he had not spoken, “we can turn it all around. We can make it <span class="italic">bad</span> for you. You could be a bad joke forever, Shadow. Or you could be remembered as a monster. You could be remembered forever, but as a Manson, a Hitler…how would you <span class="italic">like</span> that?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m sorry, ma’am, but I’m kind of tired,” said Shadow. “I’d be grateful if you’d leave now.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I offered you the world,” she said. “When you’re dying in a gutter, you re<span class="italic">mem</span>ber that.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ll make a point of it,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">After she had gone her perfume lingered. He lay on the bare mattress and thought about Laura, but whatever he thought about—Laura playing Frisbee, Laura eating a root-beer float without a spoon, Laura giggling, showing off the exotic underwear she had bought when she attended a travel agents’ convention in Anaheim—always morphed, in his mind, into Laura sucking Robbie’s cock as a truck slammed them off <a id="page393"></a>the road and into oblivion. And then he heard her words, and they hurt every time.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">You’re not dead,</span> said Laura in her quiet voice, in his head. <span class="italic">But I’m not sure that you’re alive, either.</span></p>

    <p class="normal">There was a knock. Shadow got up and opened the door. It was the fat kid. “Those hamburgers,” he said. “They were just icky. Can you believe it? Fifty miles from McDonald’s. I didn’t think there was anywhere in the <span class="italic">world</span> that was fifty miles from McDonald’s.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“This place is turning into Grand Central Station,” said Shadow. “Okay, so I guess you’re here to offer me the freedom of the Internet if I come over to your side of the fence. Right?”</p>

    <p class="normal">The fat kid was shivering. “No. You’re already dead meat,” he said. “You-you’re a fucking illuminated gothic black-letter manuscript. You couldn’t be hypertext if you tried. I’m…I’m synaptic, while, while you’re synoptic…” He smelled strange, Shadow realized. There was a guy in the cell across the way, whose name Shadow had never known. He had taken off all his clothes in the middle of the day and told everyone that he had been sent to take them away, the truly good ones, like him, in a silver spaceship to a perfect place. That had been the last time Shadow had seen him. The fat kid smelled like that guy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Are you here for a reason?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Just wanted to talk,” said the fat kid. There was a whine in his voice. “It’s creepy in my room. That’s all. It’s <span class="italic">creepy</span> in there. Fifty miles to a McDonald’s, can you believe that? Maybe I could stay in here with you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“What about your friends from the limo? The ones who hit me? Shouldn’t you ask them to stay with you?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“The children wouldn’t operate out here. We’re in a dead zone.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said, “It’s a while until midnight, and it’s longer to dawn. I think maybe you need rest. I know I do.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The fat kid said nothing for a moment, then he nodded, and walked out of the room.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow closed his door, and locked it with the key. He lay back on the mattress.</p>

    <p class="normal">After a few moments the noise began. It took him a few moments to figure out what it had to be, then he unlocked his door and walked out into the hallway. It was the fat kid, now back in his own room. It sounded <a id="page394"></a>like he was throwing something huge against the walls of the room. From the sounds, Shadow guessed that what he was throwing was himself. “It’s just me!” he was sobbing. Or perhaps, “It’s just meat.” Shadow could not tell.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Quiet!” came a bellow from Czernobog’s room, down the hall.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow walked down to the lobby and out of the motel. He was tired.</p>

    <p class="normal">The driver still stood beside the Humvee, a dark shape in a peaked cap.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Couldn’t sleep, sir?” he asked.</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Cigarette, sir?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No, thank you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You don’t mind if I do?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Go right ahead.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The driver used a Bic disposable lighter, and it was in the yellow light of the flame that Shadow saw the man’s face, actually saw it for the first time, and recognized him, and began to understand.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow knew that thin face. He knew that there would be close-cropped orange hair beneath the black driver’s cap, cut close to the scalp like the embers of a fire. He knew that when the man’s lips smiled they would crease into a network of rough scars.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You’re looking good, big guy,” said the driver.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Low Key?” Shadow stared at his old cellmate warily.</p>

    <p class="normal">Prison friendships are good things: they get you through bad places and through dark times. But a prison friendship ends at the prison gates, and a prison friend who reappears in your life is at best a mixed blessing.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Jesus. Low Key Lyesmith,” said Shadow, and then he heard what he was saying and he understood. “Loki,” he said. “Loki Lie-Smith.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You’re slow,” said Loki, “but you get there in the end.” And his lips twisted into a crooked smile and embers danced in the shadows of his eyes.</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>hey sat in Shadow’s room in the abandoned motel, sitting on the bed, at opposite ends of the mattress. The sounds from the fat kid’s room had pretty much stopped.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You lied to me,” said Shadow.</p>

    <a id="page395"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“It’s one of the things I’m good at,” said Loki. “But you were lucky we were inside together. You would never have survived your first year without me.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You couldn’t have walked out if you wanted?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s easier just to do the time. You got to understand the god thing. It’s not magic. Not exactly. It’s about focus. It’s about being you, but the <span class="italic">you</span> that people believe in. It’s about being the concentrated, magnified essence of you. It’s about becoming thunder, or the power of a running horse, or wisdom. You take all the belief, all the prayers, and they become a kind of certainty, something that lets you become bigger, cooler, more than human. You crystallize.” He paused. “And then one day they forget about you, and they don’t believe in you, and they don’t sacrifice, and they don’t care, and the next thing you know you’re running a three-card monte game on the corner of Broadway and Forty-third.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Why were you in my cell?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Coincidence. Pure and simple. That was where they put me. You don’t believe me? It’s true.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And now you’re a driver?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I do other stuff too.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Driving for the opposition.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“If you want to call them that. It depends where you’re standing. The way I figure it, I’m driving for the winning team.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“But you and Wednesday, you were from the same, you’re both—”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Norse pantheon. We’re both from the Norse pantheon. Is that what you’re trying to say?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yeah.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“So?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow hesitated. “You must have been friends. Once.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No. We were never friends. I’m not sorry he’s dead. He was just holding the rest of us back. With him gone, the rest of them are going to have to face up to the facts: it’s change or die, evolve or perish. I’m all for evolution—it’s the old change-or-die game. He’s dead. War’s over.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow looked at him, puzzled. “You aren’t that stupid,” he said. “You were always so sharp. Wednesday’s death isn’t going to end anything. It’s just pushed all of the ones who were on the fence over the edge.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Mixing metaphors, Shadow. Bad habit.”</p>

    <a id="page396"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Whatever,” said Shadow. “It’s still true. Jesus. His death did in an instant what he’d spent the last few months trying to do. It united them. It gave them something to believe in.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Perhaps.” Loki shrugged. “As far as I know, the thinking on this side of the fence was that with the troublemaker out of the way, the trouble would also be gone. It’s not any of my business, though. I just drive.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“So tell me,” said Shadow, “why does everyone care about me? They act like I’m important. Why does it matter what I do.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You’re an investment,” said Loki. “You were important to us because you were important to Wednesday. As for the why of it…I don’t think any of us know. He did. He’s dead. Just another one of life’s little mysteries.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m tired of mysteries.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yeah? I think they add a kind of zest to the world. Like salt in a stew.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“So you’re their driver. You drive for all of them?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Whoever needs me,” said Loki. “It’s a living.”</p>

    <p class="normal">He raised his wristwatch to his face, pressed a button: the dial glowed a gentle blue, which illuminated his face, giving it a haunting, haunted appearance. “Five to midnight. Time,” said Loki. “Time to light the candles. Say a few words about the dearly departed. Do the formalities. You coming?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow took a deep breath. “I’m coming,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">They walked down the dark motel corridor. “I bought some candles for this, but there were plenty of old ones around too,” said Loki. “Old stumps and stubs and candle-ends in the rooms, and in a box in a closet. I don’t think I missed any. And I got a box of matches. You start lighting candles with a lighter, the end gets too hot.”</p>

    <p class="normal">They reached room five.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You want to come in?” asked Loki.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow didn’t want to enter that room. “Okay,” he said. They went in.</p>

    <p class="normal">Loki took a box of matches from his pocket, and thumb-nailed a match into flame. The momentary flare hurt Shadow’s eyes. A candlewick flickered and caught. And another. Loki lit a new match, and continued to light candles: they were on the windowsills and on the headboard <a id="page397"></a>of the bed and on the sink in the corner of the room. They showed him the room by candlelight.</p>

    <p class="normal">The bed had been hauled from its position against the wall into the middle of the motel room, leaving a few feet of space between the bed and the wall on each side. There were sheets draped over the bed, old motel sheets, moth-holed and stained, which Loki must have found in a closet somewhere. On top of the sheets lay Wednesday, perfectly still.</p>

    <p class="normal">He was fully dressed, in the pale suit he had been wearing when he was shot. The right side of his face was untouched, perfect, unmarred by blood. The left side of his face was a ragged mess, and the left shoulder and front of the suit was spattered with dark spots, a pointillist mess. His hands were at his sides. The expression on that wreck of a face was far from peaceful: it looked hurt—a soul-hurt, a real down deep hurt, filled with hatred and anger and raw craziness. And, on some level, it looked satisfied.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow imagined Mr. Jacquel’s practiced hands smoothing that hatred and pain away, rebuilding a face for Wednesday with mortician’s wax and make-up, giving him a final peace and dignity that even death had denied him.</p>

    <p class="normal">Still, the body seemed no smaller in death. It had not shrunk. And it still smelled faintly of Jack Daniel’s.</p>

    <p class="normal">The wind from the plains was rising: he could hear it howling around the old motel at the exact imaginary center of America. The candles on the windowsill guttered and flickered.</p>

    <p class="normal">He could hear footsteps in the hallway. Someone knocked on a door, called, “Hurry up please, it’s time,” and they began to shuffle in, heads lowered.</p>

    <p class="normal">Town came in first, followed by Media and Mr. Nancy and Czernobog. Last of all came the fat kid: he had fresh red bruises on his face, and his lips were moving all the time, as if he were reciting some words to himself, but he was making no sound. Shadow found himself feeling sorry for him.</p>

    <p class="normal">Informally, without a word being spoken, they ranged themselves about the body, each an arm’s length away from the next. The atmosphere in the room was religious—deeply religious, in a way that Shadow <a id="page398"></a>had never previously experienced. There was no sound but the howling of the wind and the crackling of the candles.</p>

    <p class="normal">“We are come together, here in this godless place,” said Loki, “to pass on the body of this individual to those who will dispose of it properly according to the rites. If anyone would like to say something, say it now.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Not me,” said Town. “I never properly met the guy. And this whole thing makes me feel uncomfortable.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog said, “These actions will have consequences. You know that? This can only be the start of it all.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The fat kid started to giggle, a high-pitched, girlish noise. He said, “Okay. Okay I’ve got it.” And then, all on one note, he recited:</p>

    <div class="extract1">
      <p class="extractVerse" style="text-indent: 0%; margin-left: 5%;">“Turning and turning in the widening gyre</p>

      <p class="extractVerse" style="text-indent: 0%; margin-left: 5%;">The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</p>

      <p class="extractVerse" style="text-indent: 0%; margin-left: 5%;">Things fall apart; the center cannot hold…”</p>
    </div>

    <p class="paraNoIndent">and then he broke off, his brow creasing. He said, “Shit. I used to know the whole thing,” and he rubbed his temples and made a face and was quiet.</p>

    <p class="normal">And then they were all looking at Shadow. The wind was screaming now. He didn’t know what to say. He said, “This whole thing is pitiful. Half of you killed him or had a hand in his death. Now you’re giving us his body. Great. He was an irascible old fuck but I drank his mead and I’m still working for him. That’s all.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Media said, “In a world where people die every day, I think the <span class="italic">important</span> thing to remember is that for each moment of sorrow we get when people <span class="italic">leave</span> this world there’s a corresponding moment of <span class="italic">joy</span> when a new baby comes into this world. That first wail is—well, it’s <span class="italic">magic,</span> isn’t it? Perhaps it’s a <span class="italic">hard</span> thing to say, but joy and sorrow are like milk and cookies. <span class="italic">That’s</span> how well they go together. I think we should all take a moment to meditate on that.”</p>

    <p class="normal">And Mr. Nancy cleared his throat and said, “So. I got to say it, because nobody else here will. We are at the center of this place: a land that has no time for gods, and here at the center it has less time for us than anywhere. It is a no-man’s land, a place of truce, and we observe our truces, here. We have no choice. So. You give us the body of our <a id="page399"></a>friend. We accept it. You will pay for this, murder for murder, blood for blood.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Town said, “Whatever. You could save yourselves a lot of time and effort by going back to your homes and shooting yourselves in the heads. Cut out the middleman.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Fuck you,” said Czernobog. “Fuck you and fuck your mother and fuck the fucking horse you fucking rode in on. You will not even die in battle. No warrior will taste your blood. No one alive will take your life. You will die a soft, poor death. You will die with a kiss on your lips and a lie in your heart.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Leave it, old man,” said Town.</p>

    <p class="normal">“<span class="italic">The blood-dimmed tide is loose,</span>” said the fat kid. “I think that comes next.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The wind howled.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Okay,” said Loki. “He’s yours. We’re done. Take the old bastard away.”</p>

    <p class="normal">He made a gesture with his fingers, and Town, Media and the fat kid left the room. He smiled at Shadow. “Call no man happy, huh, kid?” he said. And then he, too, walked away.</p>

    <p class="normal">“What happens now?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Now we wrap him up,” said Anansi. “And we take him away from here.”</p>

    <p class="normal">They wrapped the body in the motel sheets, wrapped it well in its impromptu shroud, so there was no body to be seen, and they could carry it. The two old men walked to each end of the body, but Shadow said, “Let me see something,” and he bent his knees and slipped his arms around the white-sheeted figure, pushed him up and over his shoulder. He straightened his knees, until he was standing, more or less easily. “Okay,” he said. “I’ve got him. Let’s put him into the back of the car.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog looked as if he were about to argue, but he closed his mouth. He spat on his forefinger and thumb and began to snuff the candles between his fingertips. Shadow could hear them fizz as he walked from the darkening room.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wednesday was heavy, but Shadow could cope, if he walked steadily. He had no choice. Wednesday’s words were in his head with every step he took along the corridor, and he could taste the sour-sweetness of mead <a id="page400"></a>in the back of his throat. <span class="italic">You work for me. You protect me. You help me. You transport me from place to place. You investigate, from time to time—go places and ask questions for me. You run errands. In an emergency, but only in an emergency, you hurt people who need to be hurt. In the unlikely event of my death, you will hold my vigil…</span></p>

    <p class="normal">A deal was a deal, and this one was in his blood and in his bones.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy opened the motel lobby door for him, then hurried over and opened the back of the bus. The other four were already standing by their Humvee, watching them as if they could not wait to be off. Loki had put his driver’s cap back on. The cold wind whipped at the sheets, tugged at Shadow as he walked.</p>

    <p class="normal">He placed Wednesday down as gently as he could in the back of the bus.</p>

    <p class="normal">Someone tapped him on the shoulder. He turned. Town stood there with his hand out. He was holding something.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Here,” said Mr. Town, “Mister World wanted you to have this.” It was a glass eye. There was a hairline crack down the middle of it, and a tiny chip gone from the front. “We found it in the Masonic hall, when we were cleaning up. Keep it for luck. God knows you’ll need it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow closed his hand around the eye. He wished he could come back with something smart and sharp and clever, but Town was already back at the Humvee, and climbing up into the car; and Shadow still couldn’t think of anything clever to say.</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">C</span></span>zernobog was the last person out of the motel. As he locked the building he watched the Humvee pull out of the park and head off down the blacktop. He put the key to the motel beneath a rock by the lobby door, and he shook his head. “I should have eaten his heart,” he said to Shadow, conversationally. “Not just cursed his death. He needs to be taught respect.” He climbed into the back of the bus.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You ride shotgun,” said Mr. Nancy to Shadow. “I’ll drive a while.”</p>

    <p class="normal">He drove east.</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">D</span></span>awn found them in Prince ton, Missouri. Shadow had not slept yet.</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy said, “Anywhere you want us to drop you? If I were you, I’d rustle up some ID and head for Canada. Or Mexico.”</p>

    <a id="page401"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“I’m sticking with you guys,” said Shadow. “It’s what Wednesday would have wanted.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You aren’t working for him any more. He’s dead. Once we drop his body off, you are free to go.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And do what?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Keep out of the way, while the war is on. Like I say, you should leave the country,” said Nancy. He flipped his turn signal, and took a left.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hide yourself, for a little time,” said Czernobog. “Then, when this is over, you will come back to me, and I will finish the whole thing. With my hammer.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said, “Where are we taking the body?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Virginia. There’s a tree,” said Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“A world tree,” said Czernobog with gloomy satisfaction. “We had one in my part of the world. But ours grew under the world, not above it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“We put him at the foot of the tree,” said Nancy. “We leave him there. We let you go. We drive south. There’s a battle. Blood is shed. Many die. The world changes, a little.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You don’t want me at your battle? I’m pretty big. I’m good in a fight.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy turned his head to Shadow and smiled—the first real smile Shadow had seen on Mr. Nancy’s face since he had rescued Shadow from the Lumber County Jail. “Most of this battle will be fought in a place you cannot go, and you cannot touch.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“In the hearts and the minds of the people,” said Czernobog. “Like at the big roundabout.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“The carousel,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Oh,” said Shadow. “Backstage. I got it. Like the desert with all the bones in it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy raised his head. “Backstage. Yes. Every time I figure you don’t have enough sense to bring guts to a bear, you surprise me. That’s right. Backstage. That’s where the real battle will happen. Everything else will just be flash and thunder.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Tell me about the vigil,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Someone has to stay with the body. It’s a tradition. One of our people will do it.”</p>

    <a id="page402"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“He wanted me to do it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Czernobog. “It will kill you. Bad, bad, bad idea.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yeah? It’ll kill me? To stay with his body?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s what happens when the all-father dies,” said Mr. Nancy. “It wouldn’t be true for me. When I die, I just want them to plant me somewhere warm. And then when pretty women walk over my grave I would grab their ankles, like in that movie.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I never saw that movie,” said Czernobog.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Of course you did. It’s right at the end. It’s the high school movie. All the children going to the prom.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog shook his head.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said, “The film’s called <span class="italic">Carrie,</span> Mister Czernobog. Okay, one of you tell me about the vigil.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy said, “You tell him. I’m drivin’.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I never heard of no film called <span class="italic">Carrie</span>. You tell him.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Nancy said, “The person on the vigil—gets tied to the tree. Just like Wednesday was. And then they hang there for nine days and nine nights. No food, no water. All alone. At the end they cut the person down, and if they lived…well, it could happen. And Wednesday will have had his vigil.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog said, “Maybe Alviss will send us one of his people. A dwarf could survive it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ll do it,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Mr. Nancy.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">The two old men were silent. Then Nancy said, “Why?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Because it’s the kind of thing a living person would do,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You are crazy,” said Czernobog.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Maybe. But I’m going to hold Wednesday’s vigil.”</p>

    <p class="normal">When they stopped for gas Czernobog announced he felt sick, and wanted to ride in the front. Shadow didn’t mind moving to the back of the bus. He could stretch out more, and sleep.</p>

    <p class="normal">They drove on in silence. Shadow felt that he’d done something very big and very strange, and he wasn’t certain exactly what it was.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hey. Czernobog,” said Mr. Nancy, after a while. “You check out the technical boy back at the motel? He was not happy. He’s been screwin’ <a id="page403"></a>with something that screwed him right back. That’s the biggest trouble with the new kids—they figure they know everythin’, and you can’t teach them nothin’ but the hard way.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Good,” said Czernobog.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow was stretched out full length on the seat in the back. He felt like two people, or more than two. There was part of him that felt gently exhilarated: he had <span class="italic">done</span> something. He had moved. It wouldn’t have mattered if he hadn’t wanted to live, but he did want to live, and that made all the difference. He hoped he would live through this, but he was willing to die, if that was what it took to be alive. And, for a moment he thought that the whole thing was funny, just the funniest thing in the world; and he wondered if Laura would appreciate the joke.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was another part of him—maybe it was Mike Ainsel, he thought, vanished off into nothing at the press of a button in the Lakeside Police Department—who was still trying to figure it all out, trying to see the big picture.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hidden Indians,” he said out loud.</p>

    <p class="normal">“What?” came Czernobog’s irritated croak from the front seat.</p>

    <p class="normal">“The pictures you’d get to color in as kids. ‘Can you see the hidden Indians in this picture? There are ten Indians in this picture, can you find them all?’ And at first glance you could only see the waterfall and the rocks and the trees, then you see that if you just tip the picture on its side that shadow is an Indian…” He yawned.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Sleep,” suggested Czernobog.</p>

    <p class="normal">“But the big picture,” said Shadow. Then he slept, and dreamed of hidden Indians.</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he tree was in Virginia. It was a long way away from anywhere, on the back of an old farm. To get to the farm they had had to drive for almost an hour south from Blacksburg, to drive roads with names like Pennywinkle Branch and Rooster Spur. They got turned around twice and Mr. Nancy and Czernobog both lost their tempers with Shadow and with each other.</p>

    <p class="normal">They stopped to get directions at a tiny general store, set at the bottom of the hill in the place where the road forked. An old man came out of the back of the store and stared at them: he wore OshKosh B’gosh <a id="page404"></a>denim overalls and nothing else, not even shoes. Czernobog bought a pickled hog’s foot from the huge jar of hogs’ feet on the counter, and went outside to eat it on the deck, while Nancy and the man in the overalls took turns drawing each other maps on the back of napkins, marking off turnings and local landmarks.</p>

    <p class="normal">They set off once more, with Mr. Nancy driving, and they were there in ten minutes. A sign on the gate said <span class="smallCaps">ASH</span>.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow got out of the bus, and opened the gate. The bus drove through, jolting through the meadowland. Shadow closed the gate. He walked a little behind the bus, stretching his legs, jogging when the bus got too far in front of him. Enjoying the sensation of moving his body.</p>

    <p class="normal">He had lost all sense of time on the drive from Kansas. Had they been driving for two days? Three days? He did not know.</p>

    <p class="normal">The body in the back of the bus did not seem to be rotting. He could smell it—a faint odor of Jack Daniel’s, overlaid with something that might have been sour honey. But the smell was not unpleasant. From time to time he would take out the glass eye from his pocket and look at it: it was shattered deep inside, fractured from what he imagined was the impact of a bullet, but apart from a chip to one side of the iris the surface was unmarred. Shadow would run it through his hands, palming it, rolling it, pushing it along with his fingers. It was a ghastly souvenir, but oddly comforting: and he suspected that it would have amused Wednesday to know that his eye had wound up in Shadow’s pocket.</p>

    <p class="normal">The farmhouse was dark and shut up. The meadows were overgrown and seemed abandoned. The building’s roof was crumbling at the back; it was covered in black plastic sheeting. They jolted over a ridge and Shadow saw the tree.</p>

    <p class="normal">It was silver-gray and it was higher than the farmhouse. It was the most beautiful tree Shadow had ever seen: spectral and yet utterly real and almost perfectly symmetrical. It also looked instantly familiar: he wondered if he had dreamed it, then realized that no, he had seen it before, or a representation of it, many times. It was Wednesday’s silver tiepin.</p>

    <p class="normal">The VW bus jolted and bumped across the meadow, and came to a stop about twenty feet from the trunk of the tree.</p>

    <p class="normal">There were three women standing by the tree. At first glance Shadow <a id="page405"></a>thought that they were the Zorya, but he realized in moments that he was mistaken. They were three women he did not know. They looked tired and bored, as if they had been standing there for a long time. Each of them held a wooden ladder. The biggest one of them also carried a brown sack. They looked like a set of Russian dolls: a tall one—she was Shadow’s height, or even taller—a middle-sized one, and a woman so short and hunched that at first glance Shadow wrongly supposed her to be a child. Still, they looked so much alike—something in the forehead, or the eyes, or the set of the chin—that Shadow was certain that the women must be sisters.</p>

    <p class="normal">The smallest of the women dropped to a curtsy when the bus drew up. The other two just stared. They were sharing a cigarette, and they smoked it down to the filter before one of them stubbed it out against a root.</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog opened the back of the bus and the biggest of the women pushed past him, and, easily as if it were a sack of flour, she lifted Wednesday’s body out of the back and carried it to the tree. She laid it in front of the tree, put it down about ten feet from the trunk. She and her sisters unwrapped Wednesday’s body. He looked worse by daylight than he had by candlelight in the motel room, and after one quick glance Shadow looked away. The women arranged his clothes, tidied his suit, then placed him at the corner of the sheet, and wound it around him once more.</p>

    <p class="normal">Then the women came over to Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—You are the one?</span> the biggest of them asked.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—The one who will mourn the all-father?</span> asked the middle-sized one.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">—You have chosen to take the vigil?</span> asked the smallest.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow nodded. Afterward, he was unable to remember whether he had actually heard their voices. Perhaps he had simply understood what they had meant from their looks and their eyes.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy, who had gone back to the house to use the bathroom, came walking back to the tree. He was smoking a cigarillo. He looked thoughtful.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Shadow,” he called. “You really don’t have to do this. We can find somebody more suited. You ain’t ready for this.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m doing it,” said Shadow, simply.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You don’t have to,” said Mr. Nancy. “You don’t know what you’re lettin’ yourself in for.”</p>

    <a id="page406"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“It doesn’t matter,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“And if you die?” asked Mr. Nancy. “If it kills you?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Then,” said Shadow, “it kills me.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Mr. Nancy flicked his cigarillo into the meadow, angrily. “I said you had shit for brains, and you still have shit for brains. Can’t see when somebody’s tryin’ to give you an out?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m sorry,” said Shadow. He didn’t say anything else. Nancy walked back to the bus.</p>

    <p class="normal">Czernobog walked over to Shadow. He did not look pleased. “You must come through this alive,” he said. “Come through this safely for me.” And then he tapped his knuckle gently against Shadow’s forehead and said, “<span class="italic">Bam!</span>” He squeezed Shadow’s shoulder, patted his arm, and walked back to the bus.</p>

    <p class="normal">The biggest woman, whose name seemed to be Urtha or Urder—Shadow could not repeat it back to her to her satisfaction—told him, in pantomime, to take off his clothes.</p>

    <p class="normal">“All of them?”</p>

    <p class="normal">The big woman shrugged. Shadow stripped to his briefs and T-shirt. The women propped the ladders against the tree. One of the ladders—it was painted by hand, with little flowers and leaves twining up the struts—they pointed out to him.</p>

    <p class="normal">He climbed the nine steps. Then, at their urging, he stepped onto a low branch.</p>

    <p class="normal">The middle woman tipped out the contents of the sack onto the meadow-grass. It was filled with a tangle of thin ropes, brown with age and dirt, and the woman began to sort them out into lengths, and to lay them carefully on the ground beside Wednesday’s body.</p>

    <p class="normal">They climbed their own ladders now, and they began to knot the ropes, intricate and elegant knots, and they wrapped the ropes first about the tree, and then about Shadow. Unembarrassed, like midwives or nurses or those who lay out corpses, they removed his T-shirt and briefs, then they bound him, never tightly, but firmly and finally. He was amazed at how comfortably the ropes and the knots bore his weight. The ropes went under his arms, between his legs, around his waist, his ankles, his chest, binding him to the tree.</p>

    <p class="normal">The final rope was tied, loosely, about his neck. It was initially un<a id="page407"></a>comfortable, but his weight was well distributed and none of the ropes cut his flesh.</p>

    <p class="normal">His feet were five feet above the ground. The tree was leafless and huge, its branches black against the gray sky, its bark a smooth silvery gray.</p>

    <p class="normal">They took the ladders away. There was a moment of panic as he dropped a few inches, as all his weight was taken by the ropes. He made no sound.</p>

    <p class="normal">He was entirely naked by that point.</p>

    <p class="normal">The women placed the body, wrapped in its motel-sheet shroud, at the foot of the tree, and they left him there.</p>

    <p class="normal">They left him there alone.</p>
