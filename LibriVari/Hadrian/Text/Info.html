  <h2>Bibliographical Note</h2>

  <p class="normal">A reconstruction of an historical figure and of the world of his time written in the first person borders on the domain of fiction, and sometimes of poetry; it can therefore dispense with formal statement of evidence for the historical facts concerned. Its human significance, however, is greatly enriched by close adherence to those facts. Since the main object of the author here has been to approach inner reality, if possible, through careful examination of what the documents themselves afford, it seems advisable to offer the reader some discussion of the principal materials employed, though not to present a complete bibliography, which would extend beyond the scope of the present volume. Some brief indication will also be given of the comparatively few changes, all of secondary importance, which add to, or cautiously modify, what history has told us.</p>

  <p class="normal">The reader who likes to consider sources at first hand will not necessarily know where to find the principal ancient texts relating to Hadrian, or even what they are, since most of them come down to us from writers of the late classical period who are relatively little read, and who are ordinarily familiar only to specialists. Our two chief authorities are the Greek historian Dio Cassius and the Latin chronicler known by the name of Spartianus. Dio's <i>Roman History,</i> written about forty years after Hadrian's death but surviving, unfortunately, only in abridged form, devotes a chapter to this emperor. Somewhat more than a century after Dio, and apparently writing independently of his Greek predecessor, Spartianus composed a <i>Life of Hadrian,</i> one of the most substantial texts of the <i>Historia Augusta,</i> and a <i>Life of Aelius Caesar,</i> a slighter work of that same collection. The latter biography presents a very plausible likeness of Hadrian's adopted son, and is superficial only because, after all, the subject was so himself. These two writers had access to documents no longer extant, among others an autobiography published by Hadrian under the name of his freedman Phlegon, as well as a collection of the emperor's letters assembled by this same secretary. Neither Dio nor Spartianus is great as historian or biographer, but their very lack of art, and, to a certain degree, their lack of system, leave them singularly close to actuality. On the whole, modern research has confirmed their assertions in striking manner, and it is in great part upon their piecemeal accumulation of facts that the present interpretation is based.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mention may also be made, without attempting a comprehensive listing, of some details gleaned in other <i>Lives</i> of the <i>Historia Augusta,</i> in particular in the biographies of Antoninus and of Marcus Aurelius by Julius Capitolinus. Some phrases have been taken from Aurelius Victor's <i>Book of the Caesars</i> and from the unknown author of the <i>Epitome,</i> professedly the work of Aurelius Victor, too. Both these writers, though only some half century later than Spartianus, already conceive of Hadrian's life as almost legendary, but the splendor of their rhetoric puts them in a class apart. The historians Eutropius and Ammianus Marcellinus, also of the latter half of the fourth century, add little to the information given by earlier writers on Hadrian. Likewise the notice on this emperor in the <i>Lexicon</i> of the tenth-century Byzantine scholar Suidas, and the few pages devoted to him by the historian Zonaras, of the twelfth century, hardly do more than repeat Dio; but two other notices in Suidas provide each a fact little known about one episode in Hadrian's life, namely that a <i>Consolation</i> was addressed to him by the philosopher Numenios, and that Mesomedes, the court musician, composed music for the funeral of Antinous.</p>

  <p class="normal">From Hadrian himself we have a certain number of works of unquestioned authenticity: from his official life there is administrative correspondence and there are fragments of discourses or reports, like the noted address to the troops at Lambaesis, conserved for the most part in inscriptions; also his legal decisions, handed down by the jurists. From his personal life we have poems mentioned by authors of his time, such as his celebrated <i>Animula Vagula Blandula,</i> or occurring as votive inscriptions, like the poem to Eros and the Uranian Aphrodite on the temple wall at Thespiae (G. Kaibel, <i>Epigr. Gr.</i> 811). Three letters supposedly written by Hadrian, and concerning his personal life, are of doubtful authenticity <i>(Letter to Matidia, Letter to Servianus, Letter addressed by the Dying Emperor to Antoninus,</i> to be found respectively in the collection of Dositheus, in the <i>Vita Saturnini</i> of Vopiscus, and in a fragment of Fayum papyrus, edited by Grenfell and Hunt, <i>Fayum Towns and Their Papyri,</i> 1900). All three of these letters, nevertheless, are decidedly characteristic of the man to whom they are attributed, and therefore certain indications which they afford have been used in this book.</p>

  <p class="normal">References or allusions to Hadrian or to his entourage are to be found scattered through most of the writers of the second and third centuries, and serve to complete suggestions in the chronicles, or fill in lacunae there. Thus, to cite only a few examples, the episode of the hunt in Libya is taken from a fragment of a poem of Pancrates, <i>The Hunt of Hadrian and</i> <i>Antinous,</i> found in Egypt and published in 1911 in the collection, <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri,</i> VIII, No. 1085; Athenaeus, Aulus Gellius, and Philostratus have furnished numerous details on the sophists and poets of the imperial court; both the Younger Pliny and Martial add a few touches to the somewhat sketchy information left to us by Apuleius and by Trajan's historians for two of Hadrian's friends, Voconius and Licinius Sura. The description of Hadrian's grief at the death of Antinous is drawn from the historians of the reign, but also from certain passages in the Church Fathers, who though indeed disapproving are sometimes more understanding on this subject, and above all more varied in their approach to it, than the usual blanket references to their opinions would reveal. We have allusions to that grief also in the writings of the emperor's friend Arrian, from whom actual passages have been incorporated in these <i>Memoirs (Letter from Arrian to the Emperor Hadrian on the Occasion of the Circumnavigation of the Black Sea,</i> a text questioned by some scholars, but accepted by others as genuine except for minor interpolations). For the war in Palestine, certain details known to be authentic have been extracted from the <i>Talmud,</i> where they lie imbedded in an immense amount of legendary material; they serve to supplement the principal account of that war as given in Eusebius' <i>Ecclesiastical History.</i> Details of the exile of Favorinus come from a fragment of that writer in a manuscript of the Vatican Library published in 1931 (M. Norsa and G. Vitelli, // <i>Papiro Vaticano Greco</i> II, in <i>Studi e Testi,</i> LIII); the horrible episode of the secretary blinded in one eye occurs in a treatise of Galen, who was physician to Marcus Aurelius; the picture of the dying Hadrian is built upon the somber portrait which Fronto, an intimate of Marcus Aurelius, gives of the emperor in his last years.</p>

  <p class="normal">Statues, reliefs, inscriptions, and coins have provided factual details not recorded by ancient writers. Certain glimpses into the savagery of the Dacian and Sarmatian wars, such as prisoners burned alive and counselors of King Decebalus poisoning themselves on the day of their capitulation, are afforded by the scenes on Trajan's Column (W. Froehner, <i>La Colonne Trajane,</i> 1865; I. A. Richmond, <i>Trajan's Army on Trajan's Column, Papers of the British School at Rome,</i> XIII, 1935). Certain inscriptions serve as points of departure for episodes constructed in this work: thus the three poems of Julia Balbilla carved on the legs of the Colossus of Memnon, and Hadrian's own name carved on that statue as well, help to build the visit to Thebes (J. A. Letronne, <i>Recueil des Inscriptions grecques et latines de I'Egypte,</i> II, 1848, and R. Cagnat, <i>Inscr. Graec. ad res Rom. pert., I,</i> 1186-7). The day of the year on which Antinous was born is given as it occurs on an inscription left by a fraternity of workmen and slaves in Lanuvium, who chose that new deity for their patron and protector in the year 133 <i>(Corp. Inscr. Lot.</i> XIV, 2112). This precision as to the day has been questioned by Mommsen but has been accepted since his time by less hypercritical scholars. The several phrases presented in these <i>Memoirs</i> as if inscribed on the tomb of the favorite are taken from the long text in hieroglyphs on the obelisk of the Pincio in Rome, telling of Antinous' funeral and detailing the ritual of his cult. (A. Erman, <i>Obelisken Romischer Zeit,</i> in <i>Mitt. d. deutsch. arch. Inst., Rom. Abt.,</i> XI, 1896; O. Marucchi, <i>Gli Obelischi Egiziani di Roma,</i> 1898). The coins of the reign suggest many details for the voyages described; the legends on some of these coins have furnished titles for the parts of this book (with two exceptions, one drawn from Aurelius Victor), and have often provided the keynotes for Hadrian's meditations themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">To discuss briefly the study of Hadrian and his period by modern and contemporary writers it may first be noted that already in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries all historians of Rome from Tillemont to Gibbon have touched upon this emperor, but their works, substantial as they are (the critical spirit which animates the article on Hadrian in Bayle's <i>Dictionnaire,</i> for example, remains unrivaled in its kind), belong henceforth to History's history. Nearer our time even the brilliant sketch by Renan in the first chapter of <i>L'Eglise Chrétienne</i> shows equally the marks of age. Nor is there a complete modern biography, properly speaking, to which the reader can be referred without reservation. The earliest work of the kind, that of Gregorovius, published in 1851 (revised edition 1884), is not without life and color, but is weak in everything that concerns Hadrian as administrator and prince, and is in great part outdated by researches of the past half century. The more methodical study of O. Th. Schulz, <i>Leben des Kaisers Hadrian,</i> Leipzig, 1904, is less rich in humanistic erudition than Gregorovius and is also outdated in part. The more recent biography by B. W. Henderson, <i>The Life and Principate of the Emperor Hadrian, A.D. 76-138,</i> published in 1923, though lengthy, gives only a superficial idea of Hadrian's thought and of the intellectual currents of his time, making too little use of available sources.</p>

  <p class="normal">But important specialized studies abound; in many respects modern scholarship has thrown new light upon the history of Hadrian's reign and administration. To cite only a few such studies, recent or at least relatively recent, and easily accessible, there are in English the chapter devoted to Hadrian's social and financial reforms in the masterly work of M. Rostovtzeff, <i>Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire,</i> 1926; the valuable studies, respectively, of R. H. Lacey, <i>The Equestrian Officials of Trajan and Hadrian: Their Careers, with some Notes on Hadrian's Reforms,</i> Princeton, 1917; of Paul Alexander, <i>Letters and Speeches of the Emperor Hadrian, Harv. Stud, in Class. Phil.,</i> XLIX, 1938; of W. D. Gray, <i>A Study of the Life of Hadrian Prior to his Accession, Smith Coll. Stud, in Hist.,</i> 1919; of &#160;F. Pringsheim, <i>The Legal Policy and Reforms of Hadrian, Journ. of Rom. Stud.,</i> XXIV, 1934; of R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres, <i>Roman Britain and the English Settlements,</i> 2nd ed., 1937, which includes an excellent chapter on Hadrian's visit to the British Isles. Jocelyn Toynbee offers a valuable interpretation of Hadrian's liberal and pacific policies in her <i>Roman Empire and Modern Europe, Dublin Review,</i> Jan., 1945. Among French scholarly studies may be mentioned the chapters devoted to Hadrian in <i>Le Haut-Empire Romain</i> of Leon Homo, 1933, and in <i>L'Empire Romain</i> of &#160;E. Albertini, 1936; the analysis of Trajan's Parthian campaigns and Hadrian's peace policy in <i>Histoire de I'Asie</i> by Rene Grousset, Vol. 1, 1921 (followed closely for the description of the Parthian campaigns in these <i>Memoirs);</i> the study of the literary productions of Hadrian in <i>Les Empereurs et les Lettres latines</i> by Henri Bardon, 1944; the respective works of Paul Graindor, <i>Athenes sous Hadrien,</i> 1934, Cairo, of Louis Ferret, <i>La Titulature imperiale d'Hadrien,</i> 1929, and of Bernard d-Or' geval, <i>L'Empereur Hadrien, son oeuvre legislative et administrative,</i> 1950. But the most comprehensive studies of the sources for Hadrian and his chronology are still those of the German School, J. Dürr, <i>Die Reisen des Kaisers Hadrian,</i> Vienna, 1881; J. Plew, <i>Quellenuntersuchungen zur Geschichte des Kaisers Hadrian,</i> Strassburg, 1890; E. Kornemann, <i>Kaiser Hadrian und der letzte grosse Historiker von Rom,</i> Leipzig, 1905; and especially the admirable short work of Wilhelm Weber, <i>Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Kaisers Hadrianus,</i> Leipzig, 1907. By the same Weber is the striking essay <i>Hadrian,</i> published in English in the <i>Cambridge Ancient History,</i> XI <i>(The Imperial Peace),</i> 1936, pp. 294-324. For the study of Hadrian's coins (apart from those of Antinous, to be discussed below) in relation to the events of the reign, consult H. Mattingly and E. A. Sydenham, <i>The Roman Imperial Coinage,</i> II, 1926; P. L. Strack, <i>Untersuchungen zur römischen Reichspragung des zweiten Jahrhunderts,</i> II, Stuttgart, 1933.</p>

  <p class="normal">Much material about Hadrian is to be found in studies made on his associates, and on problems which led to, or followed, the war in Palestine. For Trajan's reign, and in particular for his wars, see (apart from the text of Grousset mentioned above) R. Paribeni, <i>Optimus Princeps,</i> Messina (1927); M. Durry, <i>Le regne de Trajan d'apres les monnaies, Revue Hist.,</i> LVII, 1932; R. P. Longden, <i>Nerva and Trajan,</i> and <i>The Wars of Trajan,</i> chapters in <i>Cambridge Ancient History,</i> XI, 1936; and Wilhelm Weber, <i>Traian und Hadrian,</i> in <i>Meister der Politik</i> I<sup class="calibre24">2</sup>, Stuttgart, 1923. On Aelius Caesar, A. S. L. Farquharson, <i>On the Names of Aelius Caesar, Class. Quar.</i> II, 1908, and J. Carcopino, <i>L'Heredite dynastique chez les Antonins,</i> 1950 (whose hypotheses have been set aside as unconvincing in favor of a more literal interpretation of the texts). On the affair of the four "consulars," see especially A. von Premerstein, <i>Das</i> <i>Attentat der Konsulare auf Hadrian in Jahre 118,</i> in <i>Klio,</i> 1908; J. Carcopino, <i>Lusius Quietus, l'homme de Qwrnyn,</i> in <i>Istros,</i> 1934. On the Greek entourage of Hadrian, see more particularly A. von Premerstein, C. <i>Julius Quadratus Bassus,</i> in <i>Sitz. Bayr. Akad. d. Wiss.,</i> 1934; P. Graindor, <i>Un Milliar-daire antique: Hérode Atticus et sa famille,</i> Cairo, 1930; A. Boulanger, <i>Aelius Aristide et la sophistique dans la province d'Asie au II<sup class="calibre24">e</sup> siecle de notre ere,</i> in <i>Bib. des ec. Fr. d'Athenes et de Rome,</i> 1923; K. Horna, <i>Die Hymnen des Mesomedes,</i> Leipzig, 1928; G. Martellotti, <i>Mesomede,</i> in <i>Scuola di Filol. Class.,</i> Rome, 1929; H. C. Puech, <i>Numenius d'Apamee,</i> in <i>Melanges Bidez,</i> Brussels, 1934. On the Jewish war, for studies in English see especially A. L. Sachar, <i>A History of the Jews,</i> 1950; S. Lieberman, <i>Greek in Jewish Palestine,</i> 1942; and the articles of W. D. Gray, <i>The Founding of Aelia Capitolina and the Chronology of the Jewish War under Hadrian,</i> and <i>New Light from Egypt on the Early Reign of Hadrian, Amer. Journ. of Semit. Lang, and Lit.,</i> 1923; R. Harris, <i>Hadrian's Decree of Expulsion of the Jews from Jerusalem, Harv. Theol. Rev.</i> XIX, 1926; W. Stinespring, <i>Hadrian in Palestine, Amer. Orient. Soc.</i> LIX, 1939. See also, apart from the German works already cited, A. von Premerstein, <i>Alexandrinische und jiidische Gesandte vor Kaiser Hadrian,</i> in <i>Hermes,</i> LVII, 1922. In French, Renan's account of Hadrian's war in Palestine, in <i>L'Eglise Chretienne,</i> 1879, is essential still. The archaeologists of Israel, too, are now steadily bringing new contributions to our still limited knowledge of the history and topography of this war.</p>

  <p class="normal">What we know of Antinous, and of the posthumous cult which was built up around him, is derived from a limited number of ancient texts, both historical and literary and most of them brief, and some of which have been cited already in this <i>Note;</i> from a few inscriptions, like that of the very important text on the obelisk of the Pincio mentioned above; and from the innumerable statues, bas-reliefs, and coins of the Bithynian favorite which have come down to us. That is to say, history, iconography, and esthetic evaluation are here inseparable. Up to the time of the Renaissance, the very reprobation with which Christian tradition had surrounded the deified youth helped to keep his memory alive; from the sixteenth century on, the statues discovered in Roman vineyards, as well as the counterfeits of forgers, have served to enrich the princely and papal collections with his image. In 1764 Winckelmann, in his <i>Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums,</i> presented with a kind of fervor the first comprehensive study of Antinous portraiture, based on the statues to be seen in the Rome of his time. Such example was soon to be followed in the course of the nineteenth century by numerous essays in the fields of historical scholarship or esthetics; unequal in value, these studies are chiefly significant for what they reveal of the tastes or the moral conventions of their period. Among them should be noted especially the <i>Antinous</i> of L. Dietrichson (Christiania, 1884), a work which though based on somewhat confused idealism, and decidedly outdated from the point of view of iconographic research, nevertheless lists with almost passionate care all the ancient texts and inscriptions known about Antinous at that time. The study of F. Laban, <i>Der Gemütsausdruck des Antinous,</i> Berlin, 1891, enumerates different reactions in those German studies of esthetics from Winckelmann to the end of the nineteenth century which discuss Antinous portraiture, but it hardly touches upon the actual iconography and history of Hadrian's favorite. The essay on Antinous by J. Addington Symonds in his <i>Sketches in Italy and Greece,</i> 1900, is singularly penetrating, although the tone is now outmoded and the information on some points is outdated by recent research; unlike Laban, he tries with the help of literary and artistic documentation to approach the young Bithynian as a living reality. Symonds is one of the first critics to note the conscious revival by Hadrian of Greek erotic tradition (Note 4, p. 21, <i>A Problem in Greek Ethics,</i> privately printed, 1883, reimpressions, 1901, 1908). The important study published in 1923 by Pirro Marconi, <i>Antinoo. Saggio sull'Arte dell' Eta Adrianea, (Mon. Ant. R. Accad. Lincei,</i> XXIX), provides a very nearly complete catalogue of statues and bas-reliefs of the favorite known at that date, with good photographic illustration; although poor in discussion of esthetic values, this work marks a great advance in the iconography of the subject (still incomplete today). Marconi's careful scrutiny and comparison of the individual statues adds a few points to our knowledge of the history of Antinous himself and spells an end to the hazy dreaming in which even the best romantic critics had indulged with regard to that youth. The brief study of E. Holm, <i>Das Bildnis des Antinous,</i> Leipzig, 1933, is typical of the narrowly specialized dissertation in which iconography is wholly dissociated from psychology and from history. The second volume of Robert West's <i>Romische Porträt-Plastik,</i> Munich, 1941, contains notices (sometimes too absolute on points still open to question) on the life and portraits of Antinous, accompanied by good photographic reproduction of some of the best known statues and relief figures of Hadrian's favorite. The long essay of G. Blum, <i>Numismatique d'Antinoos, Journ. Int. d'Arch. Numismatique,</i> XVI, Athens, 1914, is still indispensable for the study of the coins of Antinous, for which it offers the only attempt, to date, in complete cataloguing and analysis. For the coins of Antinous struck in Asia Minor, consult W. H. Wad-dington, E. Babelon and Th. Reinach, <i>Recueil general des Monnaies Grecques d'Asie-Mineure,</i> I-IV, 1904-12, and I, 2nd ed., 1925; for his Alexandrine coins, J. Vogt, <i>Die Alexandrin-ischen Munzen,</i> I-II, Stuttgart, 1924; and for some of his coins in Greece, C. Seltman, <i>Greek Sculpture and Some Festival Coins,</i> in <i>Hesperia,</i> the <i>Journ. Amer. School of Class. Stud, at Athens,</i> XVII, 1948.</p>

  <p class="normal">Without mentioning the discussions of portraiture of Antinous in general appraisals of Hadrianic art, which will be referred to below, we should indicate here the great number of books, articles, and archaeological notices containing descriptions of portraits of the young Bithynian newly discovered or identified, or new appreciations of those portrayals; for example, R. Lanciani and C. L. Visconti, <i>Delle Scoperte</i> ... in <i>Bulletino Communale di Roma,</i> XIV, 1886, pp. 189-90, 208-14; G. Rizzo, <i>Antinoo-Silvano,</i> in <i>Ausonia,</i> III, 1908; P. Gauckler, <i>Le Sanctuaire syrien du Janicule,</i> 1912; R. Bar-toccini, <i>Le Terme di Lepcis (Leptis Magna),</i> in <i>Africa Italiana,</i> 1929; S. Reinach, <i>Les tetes des medallions de I'Arc de Con-stantin,</i> in <i>Rev. Arch.,</i> Serie 4, XV, 1910; H. Bulle, <i>Ein Jagd-denkmal des Kaisers Hadrian,</i> in <i>Jahr. d. arch. Inst.,</i> XXXIV, 1919; E. Buschor, <i>Die Hadrianischen Jagdbilder,</i> in <i>Mitt. d. deutsch. arch. Inst., Rom. Abt.</i> XXXVIII-IX, 1923-24; H. Kahler, <i>Hadrian und seine Villa bei Tivoli,</i> Berlin, 1950, note 151, pp. 177-9; C. Seltman, <i>Approach to Greek Art,</i> 1948. Such new research on points of iconography or numismatics has made it possible to ascertain certain aspects of the cult of Antinous and even certain dates in that short life.</p>

  <p class="normal">As to the religious atmosphere which seems to have surrounded Antinous' death, see especially W. Weber, <i>Drei U-tersuchungen zur aegyptisch-griechischen Religion,</i> Heidelberg, 1911; likewise P. Graindor, <i>Athenes sous Hadrien</i> (cited above among specialized studies on Hadrian), p. 13. The problem of the exact location of the tomb of Antinous is still unsolved, despite the arguments of C. Hiilsen, <i>Das Grab des Antinous,</i> in <i>Mitt. d. deutsch. arch. Inst., Rom. Abt.,</i> XI, 1896, and in <i>Bert. Philol. Wochenschr.,</i> March 15, 1919, and the opposite view of Kahler on this point (note 158, p. 179, of his work already cited). And finally should be noted the valuable chapter of Father A. J. Festugiere, <i>La Valeur religieuse des papyrus magiques</i> in his book <i>L'Ideal religieux des Grecs et I'Evangile,</i> 1932, especially for its analysis of the sacrifice of the <i>Esies</i> (death by immersion with consequent attainment of divine status for the victim); though without reference to the story of Hadrian's favorite, this study nevertheless throws light upon practices known to us hitherto only through an outworn literary tradition, and thus allows this legend of voluntary sacrifice to be taken out of the storehouse of operatic episode and fitted again into the very exact framework of a specific occult tradition.</p>

  <p class="normal">Most books on the general subjects of Greco-Roman and late Greek art give much space to the art which is termed Hadrianic. Mention is made here only of a few of the more substantial accessible works, all of which could have been also included among the good modern appreciations of Antinous portraiture above: H. B. Walters, <i>The Art of the Romans,</i> 1911, 2nd ed., 1928; Eugenie Strong, Chapter XV on <i>The Golden Age of Hadrian</i> in <i>Art in Ancient Rome,</i> II, 1929; G. Rodenwaldt, <i>Die Kunst der Antike (Hellas und Rom),</i> in <i>Propylaen-Kunstgeschichte,</i> III, 2, Berlin, 1930, and <i>Art from Nero to the Antonines,</i> in <i>Cambridge Ancient History,</i> XI, 1936. The work of Jocelyn Toynbee, <i>The Hadrianic School: A Chapter in the History of Greek Art,</i> 1934, is essential for Hadrianic motifs in coins and reliefs, and for their cultural and political implications. For Hadrianic portraiture in general, in addition to the book of West mentioned above, may be noted, among others, the work of P. Graindor, <i>Busies et Statues-Portraits de I'Egypte Romaine</i> (no date), and of F. Poulsen, <i>Greek and Roman Portraits in English Country Houses,</i> 1923. This much abridged list may be terminated with reference to only a few studies on Hadrian's architectural constructions: that of P. Graindor, <i>Athenes sous Hadrian</i> (mentioned above) for his buildings in Greece; for his military architecture that of J. C. Bruce, <i>Handbook to the Roman Wall,</i> ed. by Ian A. Richmond, 10th ed., 1947, and of R. G. Collingwood, <i>Roman Britain,</i> cited above among specialized studies on Hadrian. For the Villa Adriana, the works of Gaston Boissier, <i>Promenades archeologiques, Rome et Pompei,</i> 1886, and Pierre Gusman, <i>La Villa imperiale de Tibur,</i> 1904, are still essential; more recent works are those of R. Paribeni, <i>La Villa dell' Imperatore Adriano a Tivoli,</i> Milan (1927), and H. Kahler, <i>Hadrian und seine Villa bei Tivoli,</i> cited above on the subject of Antinous.</p>

  <p class="normal">As to Antinoöpolis, we know something of its appearance from travelers' accounts in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (a sentence from a Sieur Paul Lucas, who described the ruins in 1714, in the second edition of his <i>Voyage au Levant,</i> has been incorporated in the present work), but our detailed information comes from the admirable drawings of Edmé Jomard, made for the monumental <i>Description de I'Egypte</i> (Vol. IV, Paris, 1817), begun at Napoleon's order during the Egyptian campaign. They offer a very moving record of the ruined city, completely destroyed since that time. For, about the year I860, the ancient materials of the triumphal arch, the colonnades, and the theater were converted into cement or used otherwise to build factories in a neighboring Arab town. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet was the first to excavate on the site of Antinoöpolis, at the end of the last century; among his many findings were mummies of officiating attendants in the Antinous cult, together with their funeral equipment, but hardly a vestige was recovered of anything dating from the actual time of the city's founding by Hadrian. Gayet's <i>Exploration des Ruines d'Antinoe,</i> in <i>Annales</i> of the Guimet Museum, XXVI, 3, 1897, and other notes published in those <i>Annales</i> on that subject, through rather unmethodical, remain essential for study of the site. The papyri of Antinoöpolis and those of Oxyrhynchus, in the same district, in successive publication since 1898, have afforded no new details about the architecture of the Hadrianic city or the cult of the favorite there, but they provide a very complete list of its religious and administrative divisions, which evidently come down from Hadrian himself and bear witness to the strong influence of Eleusinian ritual on his thought. Weber, <i>Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Kaisers Hadrianus,</i> and Graindor, <i>Athenes sous Hadrien,</i> both cited before, give some discussion of this list, as do two other studies: E. Kühn, <i>Antinoöpolis,</i> <i>Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Hellenismus in römischen Aegypten,</i> Gottingen, 1913, and B. Kiibler, <i>Antinoupolis,</i> Leipzig, 1914. The brief article of M. J. de Johnson, <i>Antinoe and its Papyri,</i> in <i>Journ. of Egypt. Arch.,</i> I, 1914, gives an excellent summary of the topography of the ancient city. The Italian archaeologist Evaristo Breccia has also studied the site of Antinoöpolis, and has contributed an article on the subject to the <i>Enciclopedia Italiana</i> (1928) which includes a useful bibliography.</p>

  <p class="normal">History has its rules, though they are not always followed even by professional historians; poetry, too, has its laws. The two are not necessarily irreconcilable. The perspectives chosen for this narrative made necessary some rearrangements of detail, together with certain simplifications or modifications intended to eliminate repetitions, lagging, or confusion which only didactic explanation would have dispelled. It was important that these adjustments, all relating only to very small points, should in no way change the spirit or the significance of the incident or the fact in question. In other cases, the lack of authentic details for some given episode of Hadrian's life has obliged the writer to prudent filling in of such lacunae from information furnished by contemporary texts treating of analogous experiences or events; these joinings had, of course, to be kept to the indispensable minimum. And last, this work, which tries to evoke Hadrian not only as he was but also as his contemporaries saw him, and sometimes imagined him, could even make some sparing use of legendary material, provided that the material thus chosen corresponded to the conception that the men of his time (and he himself, perhaps) had of his personality. The method of making such changes and additions is best explained by specific examples, with which this <i>Note</i> is hereby concluded.</p>

  <p class="normal">The character Marullinus is built upon a name, that of an ancestor of Hadrian, and upon a tradition which says that an uncle (and not the grandfather) of the future emperor foretold the boy's fortune; the portrait of the old man and the circumstances of his death are imaginary. The character Gallus is based on an historical Gallus who played the part described here, but the detail of his final discomfiture is created only in order to emphasize one of Hadrian's traits most often mentioned, his capacity for bitter resentment. The episode of Mithraic initiation is invented; that cult was already in vogue in the army at the time, and it is possible, but not proved, that Hadrian desired to be initiated into it while he was still a young officer. Likewise, it is only a possibility that Antinous submitted himself to the ritual blood bath in Palmyra; Turbo, Meles Agrippa, and Castoras are all historical figures, but their participation in the respective initiations is invented. Hadrian's meeting with the Gymnosophist is not given by history; it has been built from first- and second-century texts which describe episodes of the same kind. All details concerning Attianus are authentic except for one or two allusions to his private life, of which we know nothing. The chapter on the mistresses has been constructed out of two lines of Spartianus (XI, 7-8) on this subject; the effort has been to stay within the most plausible general outlines, supplementing by invention where it was essential to do so.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pompeius Proculus was indeed governor of Bithynia, but was not surely so in 123-24 during the emperor's visit in those years. Strato of Sardis, an erotic poet and compiler of the twelfth book of the <i>Greek Anthology,</i> probably lived in Hadrian's time; there is nothing to prove that he saw the emperor in person, but it was tempting to make these two men meet. The visit of Lucius to Alexandria in 130 is deduced (as Gregorovius has already done) from a text often contested, the <i>Letter to Servianus,</i> discussed above, nor does the passage of this letter which refers to Lucius require such interpretation. We do not know, therefore, if he was in Egypt at that time, but almost all the details given for him at this period are drawn from his biography by Spartianus. The story of Antinous' sacrifice is traditional (Dio, LXIX, 11; Spartianus XIV, 7); the detail of the magic operations is suggested by recipes from Egyptian papyri on magic, but the incidents of the evening in Canopus are invented. The episode of the fall of a child from a balcony, during a banquet, placed in these <i>Memoirs</i> in the course of Hadrian's stop at Philae, is drawn from a report in the <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i> and took place in reality nearly forty years after Hadrian's journey in Egypt. The two examples of miracles reported by Spartianus as supposedly performed by the emperor in his last years have been blended into one. The association of Apollodorus with the Servianus conspiracy is only a hypothesis, but one which can perhaps be defended.</p>

  <p class="normal">Chabrias, Celer, and Diotimus are mentioned several times by Marcus Aurelius, who, however, indicates only their names and their passionate loyalty to Hadrian's memory. They have been introduced into this reconstruction in order to evoke something of the court of Tibur during the last years of the reign: Chabrias represents the circle of Platonist or Stoic philosophers who surrounded the emperor; the military element is represented by Celer (not to be confused with that Celer mentioned by Philostratus and Aristides as secretary for Greek correspondence); Diotimus stands for the group of imperial <i>eromenoi</i> (the term long established by tradition for young favorites). Three names of actual associates of the emperor have thus served as points of departure for three characters who are, for the most part, invented. The physician Iollas, on the contrary, is an actual person for whom we lack the true name; nor do we know if he came originally from Alexandria. The freedman Onesimus was in Hadrian's service, but we do not know if his role was that of procurer for Hadrian; the name of Crescens as a secretary of Servianus is authenticated by an inscription, but history does not tell us that he betrayed his master. Opramoas was a great merchant of Hadrian's time who aided Hadrian and his army, but there is nothing to prove that he accompanied Hadrian to the Euphrates. Arrian's wife is known to us by an inscription, but we do not know if she was "proud and elegant" as Hadrian says here. Only a few minor characters are wholly invented, the slave Euphorion, the actors Olympus and Bathyllus, the physician Leotychides, the young British tribune, and the guide Assar. The two sorceresses, of the Island of Britain and of Canopus respectively, are created to suggest the world of fortune tellers and dealers in occult sciences with whom Hadrian liked to surround himself. The feminine name of <i>Arete</i> comes from an authentic poem of Hadrian <i>(Inscr. Graec.,</i> XIV, 1089), but is given only arbitrarily here to the housekeeper of the Villa; the name of the courier Menecrates is taken from the <i>Letter of the King Fermes to the Emperor Hadrian</i> (H. Osmont, <i>Bibliotheque de I'Ecole des Chartres,</i> Vol. 74, 1913), a text of wholly legendary content which comes to us from a medieval manuscript and of which history, properly speaking, can make no use; the <i>Letter</i> could, however, have borrowed this particular name from other documents now lost. In the passages concerning young Marcus Aurelius the names <i>Veronica</i> and <i>Theodoras</i> are modifications, in part for the sake of euphony, of the two names <i>Benedicta</i> and <i>Theodotus</i> given in the <i>Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</i> 1, xvii, 7).</p>

  <p class="normal">The brief sketch of the family background of Antinous is not historical, but attempts to take into consideration the social conditions which prevailed at that time in Bithynia. On certain controversial points, such as the cause for enforced retirement of Suetonius, the origin of Antinous, whether slave or free, the active participation of Hadrian in the Palestinian war, the dates of apotheosis of Sabina and of interment of Aelius Caesar in the Castel Sant Angelo, it has been necessary to choose between hypotheses of historians, but the effort has been to make that choice only with good reason. In other cases, like that of the adoption of Hadrian by Trajan, or of the death of Antinous, the author has tried to leave that very incertitude which before it existed in history doubtless existed in life itself.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">REFLECTIONS ON THE COMPOSITION OF MEMOIRS OF HADRIAN</h3>

  <p class="normal">The idea for this book and the first writing of it, in whole or in part, and in various forms, date from the period between 1924 and 1929, between my twentieth and twenty-fifth year. All those manuscripts were destroyed, deservedly.</p>

  <p class="normal">In turning the pages of a volume of Flaubert's correspondence much read and heavily underscored by me about the year 1927 I came again upon this admirable sentence: "Just when the gods had ceased to be, and the Christ had not yet come, there was a unique moment in history, between Cicero and Marcus Aurelius, when man stood alone." A great part of my life was going to be spent in trying to define, and then to portray, that man existing alone and yet closely bound with all being.</p>

  <p class="normal">I resumed work on the book in 1934; after prolonged research some fifteen pages were written which seemed to me final in form. Then the project was abandoned, only to be taken up again several times between 1934 and 1937.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long period in which I thought of the work in the form of a series of dialogues, where all the voices of those times would be heard. But whatever I did, the details seemed to take undue precedence; the parts threatened the balance of the whole; Hadrian's voice was drowned out by all the others. I was not succeeding in my attempt to reconstruct that world as seen and heard by one man.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the version of 1934 only one sentence has been retained: "I begin to discern the profile of my death." Like a painter who has chosen a landscape, but who constantly shifts his easel now right, now left, I had at last found a point from which to view the book.</p>

  <p class="normal">Take a life that is known and completed, recorded and fixed by History (as much as lives ever can be fixed), so that its entire course may be seen at a single glance; more important still, choose the moment when the man who lived that existence weighs and examines it, and is, for the briefest span, capable of judging it. Try to manage so that he stands before his own life in much the same position as we stand when we look at it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mornings spent at the Villa Adriana; innumerable evenings passed in small cafés around the Olympieion; the constant back and forth over Greek seas; roads of Asia Minor. In order to make full use of these memories of mine they had first to recede as far from me as is the Second Century.</p>

  <p class="normal">Experiments with time: eighteen days, eighteen months, eighteen years, or eighteen centuries. The motionless survival of statues which, like the head of the <i>Mondragone Antinous</i> in the Louvre, are still living in a past time, a <i>time that has died.</i> The problem of time foreshortened in terms of human generations: some five and twenty aged men, their withered hands interlinked to form a chain, would be enough to establish an unbroken contact between Hadrian and ourselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1937, during a first stay in the United States, I did some reading for this book in the libraries at Yale; I wrote the visit to the physician, and the passage on renunciation of bodily exercise. These fragments, re-worked, are still part of the present version.</p>

  <p class="normal">In any case, I was too young. There are books which one should not attempt before having passed the age of forty. Earlier than that one may well fail to recognize those great natural boundaries which from person to person, and from century to century, separate the infinite variety of mankind; or, on the contrary, one may attach too much importance to mere administrative barriers, to the customs houses or the sentry boxes erected between man and man. It took me years to learn how to calculate exactly the distances between the emperor and myself.</p>

  <p class="normal">I ceased to work on the book (except for a few days, in Paris) between 1937 and 1939.</p>

  <p class="normal">Some mention of T. E. Lawrence reminded me that his tracks in Asia Minor cross and recross those of Hadrian. But the background for Hadrian is not the desert; it is Athens and her hills. The more I thought of these two men, the more the adventure of one who rejects life (and first of all rejects himself) made me desirous of presenting, through Hadrian, the point of view of the man who accepts all experience, or at least who refuses on one score only to accept elsewhere. It goes without saying, of course, that the asceticism of the one and the hedonism of the other are at many points interchangeable.</p>

  <p class="normal">In October of 1939 the manuscript was left behind in Europe, together with the greater part of the notes;&#160; I nevertheless took with me to the United States the several resumes of my former readings at Yale and a map of the Roman Empire at the time of Trajan's death which I had carried about with me for years; also the profile photograph of the <i>Antinous</i> of the Archaeological Museum in Florence, purchased there in 1926, the young face gravely sweet.</p>

  <p class="normal">From 1939 to 1948 the project was wholly abandoned. I thought of it at times, but with discouragement, and almost with indifference, as one thinks of the impossible. And with something like shame for ever having ventured upon such an undertaking.</p>

  <p class="normal">The lapse into despair of a writer who does not write.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the worst hours of apathy and dejection I would go for solace to Hartford's fine museum, seeking out a Canaletto painting of Rome, the Pantheon standing brown and gold against the blue sky of a late afternoon in summer; and each time I would come away from it comforted, and once again at peace.</p>

  <p class="normal">About the year 1941 I had discovered by chance, in an artists' supply shop in New York, four Piranesi engravings which G . . . and I bought. One of them, a <i>View of Hadrian's Villa</i> which I had not known before, is an interior of the chapel of Canopus, from which were taken in the Seventeenth Century the <i>Antinous</i> in Egyptian style and the accompanying basalt statues of priestesses, all to be seen today in the Vatican. The foreground shows a round structure, burst open like a skull, from which fallen trees and brush hang vaguely down, like strands of hair. The genius of Piranesi, almost mediumistic, has truly caught the element of hallucination here: he has sensed the long-continued rituals of mourning, the tragic architecture of an inner world. For several years I looked at this drawing almost daily, without a thought for my former enterprise, which I supposed that I had given up. Such are the curious detours of what is called oblivion.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the spring of 1947, while sorting over some papers I burned the notes taken at Yale; they seemed to have become by that time completely useless.</p>

  <p class="normal">Still, Hadrian's name appears in an essay on Greek myth which I wrote in 1943 and which Roger Caillois published during those war years in <i>Les Lettres Franfaises,</i> in Buenos Aires. Then in 1945 the figure of the drowned Antinous, borne along somehow on that Lethean current, came again to the surface in an unfinished essay, <i>Canticle of the Soul and its True Freedom,</i> written just before the advent of a serious illness.</p>

  <p class="normal">Keep in mind that everything recounted here is thrown out of perspective by what is left unsaid: these notes serve only to mark the lacunae. There is nothing, for example, of what I was doing during those difficult years, nor of the thinking, the work, the worries and anxieties, <i>or</i> the joys; nor of the tremendous repercussion of external events and the perpetual testing of oneself upon the touchstone of fact. And I pass also in silence over the experiences of illness, and over other, more profound experiences which they bring in their train; and over the perpetual search for, or presence of, love.</p>

  <p class="normal">Never mind. That disjunction, that break in continuity, that "night of the soul" which so many of us experienced at the time, each in his own way (and so often in far more tragic and final form than did I), was essential, perhaps, in order to force me into trying to bridge not only the distance which separated me from Hadrian, but, above all, the distance which separated me from my true self.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everything turns out to be valuable that one does for one's self without thought of profit. During those years in an unfamiliar land I had kept on with the reading of authors from classical antiquity: the red or green cloth-bound volumes of Loeb-Heinemann editions had become a country of my own. Thus, since one of the best ways to reconstruct a man's thinking is to rebuild his library, I had actually been working for years, without knowing it, to refurnish the bookshelves at Tibur in advance. Now I had only to imagine the swollen hands of a sick man holding the half-rolled manuscripts.</p>

  <p class="normal">Do, from within, the same work of reconstruction which the nineteenth-century archaeologists have done from without.</p>

  <p class="normal">In December of 1948 I received from Switzerland a trunk which I had stored there during the war, with its contents of family papers and letters some ten years old. I sat down by the fire to work my way through the debris, as if to take some gloomy inventory after a death. I passed several evenings alone at the task, undoing the separate packets and running through them before destroying that accumulation of correspondence with people whom I had forgotten, and who had forgotten me, some of them still alive, others dead. A few of the pages bore dates of a generation ago, and even the names had quite gone from my mind. As I unfolded and threw mechanically into the fire that exchange of dead thoughts between a Marie and a Francois or a Paul, long since disappeared, I came upon four or five typewritten sheets, the paper of which had turned yellow. The salutation told me nothing: "My dear Mark . . ." <i>Mark. . . .</i> What friend or love, what distant relative was this? I could not recall the name at all. It was several minutes before I remembered that <i>Mark</i> stood here for <i>Marcus A urelius,</i> and that I had in hand a fragment of the lost manuscript. From that moment there was no question but that this book must be taken up again, whatever the cost.</p>

  <p class="normal">That same night I re-opened two of the volumes which had also just been returned to me, remnants of a library in large part lost. One was Dio Cassius in Henri Estienne's beautiful printing, and the other a volume of an ordinary edition of <i>Historia Augusta,</i> the two principal sources for Hadrian's life, purchased at the time that I was intending to write this book. Everything that the world, and I, had gone through in the interval now served to enrich these chronicles of an earlier age, and threw upon that imperial existence certain other lights and other shades. Once I had thought chiefly of the man of letters, the traveller, the poet, the lover; none of that had faded, to be sure, but now for the first time I could see among all those figures, standing out with great clarity of line, the most official and yet the most hidden form of all, that of the emperor. The fact of having lived in a world which is toppling around us had taught me the importance of the Prince.</p>

  <p class="normal">I fell to making, and then re-making, this portrait of a man who was <i>almost</i> wise.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only one other figure in history has tempted me with nearly the same insistence: Omar Khayyam, the poet-astronomer. But the life of Khayyam is that of the pure contemplator, and of the somber skeptic, too; the world of action meant little to him. Furthermore, I do not know Persia, nor do I know its language.</p>

  <p class="normal">Another thing virtually impossible, to take a feminine character as a central figure, to make Plotina, for example, rather than Hadrian, the axis of my narrative. Women's lives are much too limited, or else too secret. If a woman does recount her own life she is promptly reproached for being no longer truly feminine. It is already hard enough to give some element of truth to the utterances of a man.</p>

  <p class="normal">I left for Taos, in New Mexico, taking with me the blank sheets for a fresh start on the book (the swimmer who plunges into the water with no assurance that he will reach the other shore). Closed inside my compartment as if in a cubicle of some Egyptian tomb, I worked late into the night between New York and Chicago; then all the next day, in the restaurant of a Chicago station where I awaited a train blocked by storms and snow; then again until dawn, alone in the observation car of a Santa Fe limited, surrounded by black spurs of the Colorado mountains, and by the eternal pattern of the stars. Thus were written at a single impulsion the passages on food, love, sleep, and the knowledge of men. I can hardly recall a day spent with more ardor, or more lucid nights.</p>

  <p class="normal"><a class="calibre22" id="one"></a>I pass as rapidly as possible over three years of research, of interest to specialists alone, and over the development of a method akin to controlled delirium, of interest, probably, to none but madmen. And yet this term <i>delirium</i> smacks too much of romanticism; let us say, rather, a constant participation, as intensely aware as possible, in <i>that which has been.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">One foot in scholarship, the other in magic arts, or, more accurately and without metaphor, absorption in that <i>sympathetic magic</i> which operates when one transports oneself, in thought, into another's body and soul.</p>

  <p class="normal">Portrait of a voice. If I have chosen to write these <i>Memoirs of Hadrian</i> in the first person it is in order to dispense with any intermediary, in so far as possible, even were that intermediary myself. Surely Hadrian could speak more forcibly and more subtly of his life than could I.</p>

  <p class="normal">Those who put the historical novel in a category apart are forgetting that what every novelist does is only to interpret, by means of the techniques which his period affords, a certain number of past events; his memories, whether consciously or unconsciously recalled, whether personal or impersonal, are all woven of the same stuff as History itself. The work of Proust is a reconstruction of a lost past quite as much as is <i>War and Peace.</i> The historical novel of the 1830's, it is true, tends toward melodrama, and to cloak-and-dagger romance; but not more than does Balzac's magnificent <i>Duchess of Langeais,</i> or his startling <i>Girl with the Golden Eyes,</i> both of wholly contemporary setting. Flaubert painstakingly rebuilds a Carthaginian palace by charging his description with hundreds of minute details, thus employing essentially the same method as for his picture of Yonville, a village of his own time and of his own Normandy. In our day, when introspection tends to dominate literary forms, the historical novel, or what may for convenience's sake be called by that name, must take the plunge into time recaptured, and must fully establish itself within some inner world.</p>

  <p class="normal">Time itself has nothing to do with the matter. It is always surprising to me that my contemporaries, masters as they consider themselves to be over space, apparently remain unaware that one can contract the distance between centuries at will.</p>

  <p class="normal">We lose track of everything, and of everyone, even ourselves. The facts of my father's life are less known to me than those of the life of Hadrian. My own existence, if I had to write of it, would be reconstructed by me from externals, laboriously, as if it were the life of someone else: I should have to turn to letters, and to the recollections of others, in order to clarify such uncertain memories. What is ever left but crumbled walls, or masses of shade? Here, where Hadrian's life is concerned, try to manage so that the lacunae of our texts coincide with what he himself might have forgotten.</p>

  <p class="normal">Which is not to suggest, as is too often done, that historical truth is never to be attained, in any of its aspects. With this kind of truth, as with all others, the problem is the same: one errs <i>more</i> or <i>less.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">The rules of the game: learn everything, read everything, inquire into everything, while at the same time adapting to one's ends the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> of Ignatius of Loyola, or the method of Hindu ascetics, who for years, and to the point of exhaustion, try to visualize ever more exactly the images which they create beneath their closed eyelids. Through hundreds of card notes pursue each incident to the very moment that it occurred; endeavor to restore the mobility and suppleness of life to those visages known to us only in stone. When two texts, or two assertions, or perhaps two ideas, are in contradiction, be ready to reconcile them rather than cancel one by the other; regard them as two different facets, or two successive stages, of the same reality, a reality convincingly human just because it is complex. Strive to read a text of the Second Century with the eyes, soul, and feelings of the Second Century; let it steep in that mother solution which the facts of its own time provide; set aside, if possible, all beliefs and sentiments which have accumulated in successive strata between those persons and us. And nevertheless take advantage (though prudently, and solely by way of preparatory study) of all possibilities for comparison and cross-checking, and of new perspectives slowly developed by the many centuries and events separating us from a given text, a fact, a man; make use of such aids more or less as guide-marks along the road of return toward one particular point in time. Keep one's own shadow out of the picture; leave the mirror clean of the mist of one's own breath; take only what is most essential and durable in us, in the emotions aroused by the senses or in the operations of the mind, as our point of contact with those men who, like us, nibbled olives and drank wine, or gummed their fingers with honey, who fought bitter winds and blinding rain, or in summer sought the plane tree's shade; who took their pleasures, thought their own thoughts, grew old, and died.</p>

  <p class="normal">Several times I have had physicians "diagnose" the brief passages in the chronicles which deal with Hadrian's illness. Indications not so different, after all, from the clinical descriptions of Balzac's last days.</p>

  <p class="normal">Make&#160; good&#160; use,&#160;&#160; the&#160; better&#160; to&#160; understand&#160; Hadrian's malady, of the first symptoms of a heart ailment.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What's Hecuba to him?" Hamlet asks when a strolling player weeps over that tragic queen. Thus the Prince of Denmark is forced to admit that this actor who sheds genuine tears has managed to establish with a woman dead for three thousand years a more profound relationship than he himself has with his own father, so recently buried, and whose wrongs he does not feel fully enough to seek swift revenge.</p>

  <p class="normal">The human substance and structure hardly change: nothing is more stable than the curve of a heel, the position of a tendon, or the form of a toe. But there are periods when the shoe is less deforming than in others. In the century of which I speak we are still very close to the undisguised freedom of the bare foot.</p>

  <p class="normal">In crediting Hadrian with prophetic insight I was keeping within the realm of plausibility as long as such prognostics remained vague and general. The impartial analyst of human affairs ordinarily makes few mistakes as to the ultimate course of events, but he begins to err seriously when he tries to foresee the exact way that events will work out, their turning points and details. Napoleon on Saint Helena predicted that a century after his death Europe would have turned either revolutionary or Cossack; he stated the two terms of the problem extremely well, but could not imagine one superposed upon the other. On the whole, however, it is only out of pride or gross ignorance, or cowardice, that we refuse to see in the present the lineaments of times to come. Those sages of the ancient world, unbound by dogma of any kind, thought as we do in terms of physics, or rather, of physiology, as applied to the whole universe: they envisaged the end of man and the dying out of this sphere. Both Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius knew full well that gods, and civilizations, pass and die. We are not the first to look upon an inexorable future.</p>

  <p class="normal">My attribution of clairvoyance to the emperor was, in any case, only a means of bringing into play the almost Faustian element of his character, as it appears, for example, in the <i>Sibylline Verses</i> and in the writings of Aelius Aristides, or in the portrait of Hadrian grown old, as sketched by Fronto. Rightly or not, the contemporaries of this dying man ascribed to him something more than human powers.</p>

  <p class="normal">If this man had not maintained peace in the world, and revived the economy of the empire, his personal fortunes and misfortunes would have moved me less.</p>

  <p class="normal">One can never give enough time to the absorbing study of relationships between texts. The poem on the hunting trophy consecrated by Hadrian at Thespiae to the God of Love and to the Uranian Venus, "on the hills of Helicon, beside Narcissus" spring", can be dated as of the autumn of the year 124; at about that same time the emperor passed through Mantinea, where, according to Pausanius, he had the tomb of Epaminondas rebuilt, and wrote a poem to be inscribed upon it. The Mantinean inscription is now lost, but Hadrian's act of homage is to be fully understood, perhaps, only if we view it in relation to a passage of Plutarch's <i>Morals</i> which tells us that Epaminondas was buried in that place between two young friends struck down at his side. If for date of the meeting of the emperor and Antinous we accept the stay in Asia Minor of 123-124, which is in any case the most plausible date and the best supported by iconographical evidence, these two poems then would form a part of what might be called the Antinous cycle; both are inspired by that same Greece of heroic lovers which Arrian evoked later on, after the death of the favorite, when he compared the youth to Patroclus.</p>

  <p class="normal">A certain number of persons whose portraits one would wish to develop: Plotina, Sabina, Arrian, Suetonius. But Hadrian could see them only in part, from the point of view at which he was standing. Antinous himself has to be presented by refraction, through the emperor's memories, that is to say, in passionately meticulous detail, not devoid of a few errors.</p>

  <p class="normal">All that can be said of the temperament of Antinous is inscribed in any one of his likenesses. "Eager and impassionated tenderness, sullen effeminacy": Shelley, with a poet's admirable candor, says the essential in six words, while most of the nineteenth-century art critics and historians could only expatiate upon the subject with righteous declamation, or else idealize about it, vaguely and hypocritically.</p>

  <p class="normal">We are rich in portraits of Antinous; they range in quality from the mediocre to the incomparable. Despite variations due to the skill of the respective sculptors or to the age of the model, or to differences between portraits made from life and those executed to commemorate the youth after death, all are striking and deeply moving because of the incredible realism of the face, always immediately recognizable and nevertheless so diversely interpreted, and because they are examples, unique in classical antiquity, of survival and repetition in stone of a countenance which was neither that of a statesman nor of a philosopher, but simply of one who was loved. Among these portraits the two most beautiful are the least known: they are also the only ones which transmit to us the name of the sculptor. One is the bas-relief signed by Antonianos of Aphrodisias and found some fifty years ago on the property of an agronomic institute, the Fundi Rustici, in the Committee Room of which it is now placed. Since no guidebook of Rome indicates its existence in that city already so crowded with statues, tourists do not know about it. This work of Antonianos has been carved in Italian marble, so it was certainly executed in Italy, and doubtless in Rome, either because that artist was already established in the capital, or because he had been brought back by Hadrian on one of the emperor's travels. It has exquisite delicacy. The young head, pensively inclined, is framed by the tendrils of a vine twined in supple arabesque; the brevity of life comes inevitably to mind, the sacrificial grape and the fruit-scented air of an evening in autumn. Unhappily, the marble has suffered from storage in a cellar during the recent war-years: its whiteness is temporarily obscured and earth-stained, and three fingers of the figure's left hand have been broken. Thus do gods pay for the follies of men.</p>

  <p class="normal"><i>*[The preceding paragraph appeared for the first time six years ago; meanwhile this bas-relief was acquired by a Roman banker, Arturo Oslo, a whimsical man who probably would have stirred the imagination of Stendhal or of Balzac. Signor Osio has lavished upon this fair object the same solicitous attention that he gives to the animals on his property at the edge of Rome, where they run free in their natural state, and to the trees which he has planted by the thousand on his shore estate at Orbetello. A rare virtue, this last, for Stendhal was writing as early as 1828, "The Italians loathe trees;" and what would he say today when real estate speculators, trying to pack more and more colossal apartment houses into Rome, are circumventing the city's laws to protect its handsome umbrella pines? Their method is simply to kill the trees by injections of hot water. A rare luxury, too, though one which many a man of wealth could enjoy, is this landowner's animation of woods and fields with creatures at full liberty, and that not for the pleasure of hunting them down, but for reconstituting a veritable Eden. The love for statues of classical antiquity, those great peaceful objects which seem so solid and yet are so easily destroyed, is an uncommon taste among private collectors in these agitated times, cut off</i> <i>from both past and future. The new possessor of the bas-relief of Antonianos, acting on the advice of experts, has just had it cleaned by a specialist whose light, slow rubbing by hand has removed the rust and moisture stains from the marble and restored its soft gleam, like that of alabaster or of ivory.]</i></p>

  <p class="normal"><b>* Addition of 1958.</b></p>

  <p class="normal">The second of these masterpieces is the famous sardonyx known as the Marlborough Gem, because it once belonged to that family collection, now dispersed. For more than thirty years this fine intaglio seemed to have been lost, or hidden away, but in January of 1952 it came to light in a public sale in London; the informed taste of the great collector Giorgio Sangiorgi has brought it back to Rome. I am indebted to him for the chance to see and to handle this unique gem. A signature, though no longer complete, can be read around the edge; it is thought, and doubtless correctly, to be that of the sculptor of the bas-relief, Antonianos of Aphrodisias. So skilfully has the master-carver enclosed that perfect profile within the narrow compass of a sardonyx that this bit of stone stands as testimony to a great lost art quite as much as does any statue or any relief. The proportions of the work make us forget the dimensions of the object. At some time during the Byzantine period the gem was set in a nugget of solid gold, and in this form passed from collector to collector, none of whose names we know, until it reached Venice; it is mentioned as part of a great seventeenth-century collection there. In the next century it was purchased by the celebrated dealer in antiques, Gavin Hamilton, and brought to England, whence it now returns to Rome, its starting-point. Of all objects still above ground today it is the one of which we can assume with some assurance that it has often been held in Hadrian's hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">One has to go into the most remote corners of a subject in order to discover the simplest things, and things of most general literary interest. It is only in studying Phlegon, secretary to Hadrian, that I learned that we owe to this forgotten personage the first, and one of the finest, of the great ghost stories, that somber, sensuous <i>Bride of Corinth</i> which inspired Goethe's ballad, and likewise the <i>Corinthian Wedding</i> of Anatole France. It must be said, however, that Phlegon also took down, with the same avid and uncritical curiosity for everything beyond ordinary experience, some absurd stories of two-headed monsters, and of hermaphrodites got with child. Such was the stuff of the conversations, on some days, at least, at the imperial table.</p>

  <p class="normal">Those who would have preferred a <i>Journal</i> of Hadrian to his <i>Memoirs</i> forget that a man of action rarely keeps a journal; it is almost always later on, and in a period of prolonged inactivity, that he does his recollecting, makes his notations, and, very often, has cause for wonder at the course his life has taken.</p>

  <p class="normal">If all other documents were lacking, the <i>Letter of Arrian to the Emperor Hadrian on the Circumnavigation of the Black Sea</i> would suffice to recreate in broad outline that great imperial figure: the scrupulous exactitude of the chief-of-state who would know all details; his interest in the work both of war and of peace; his concern for good likenesses in statues, and that these should be finely wrought; his passion for the poetry and legend of an earlier day. And that society, rare in any period, but destined to vanish completely after the time of Marcus Aurelius, wherein the scholarly administrator can still address his prince as a friend, however subtly shaded his deference and his respect. Everything is there: the nostalgia for ancient Greece and its ideals, discreet allusion to a lost love and to mystical consolation sought by the bereaved survivor, the haunting appeal of unknown lands and barbarous climes. The evocation of desert wastes peopled only by sea-birds, so profoundly romantic in spirit, calls to mind the exquisite vase found in Villa Hadriana, to be seen today in the Museum of the Terme in Rome; there on a field of marble snow a flock of wild heron are spreading their wings to fly away, in utter solitude.</p>

  <p class="normal">Note of 1949: the more I strive for an exact portrait the farther I diverge from the kind of book, and of man, who would please the public. Only a few students of human destiny will understand.</p>

  <p class="normal">In our time the novel devours all other forms; one is almost forced to use it as the medium of expression. This study of the destiny of a man called Hadrian would have been cast in the form of a tragedy in the Seventeenth Century, or of an essay, perhaps, in the period of the Renaissance.</p>

  <p class="normal">This book is the condensation of a vast work composed for myself alone. I had taken the habit of writing each night, in almost automatic fashion, the result of those long, self-induced visions whereby I could place myself intimately within another period of time. The merest word, the slightest gesture, the least perceptible implications were noted down; scenes now summed up in a line or two, in the book as it is, passed before me in fullest detail, and as if in slow motion. Added all together, these accounts would have afforded material for a volume of several thousand pages, but each morning I would burn the work of the night before. In such fashion I wrote a great number of decidedly abstruse meditations, and several descriptions bordering on the obscene.</p>

  <p class="normal">He who seeks passionately for truth, or at least for accuracy, is frequently the one best able to perceive, like Pilate, that truth is not absolute or pure. Hence, mingled with his most direct assertions we find hesitations, devi-ousness, and reservations which a more conventional mind would not evince. At certain moments, though very seldom, it has even occurred to me that the emperor was lying. In such cases I had to let him lie, like the rest of us.</p>

  <p class="normal">The utter fatuity of those who say to you, "By 'Hadrian' you mean yourself!" Almost as unsubtle as those who wonder why one should choose a subject so remote in time and in space. The sorcerer who pricks his thumb before he evokes the shades knows well that they will heed his call only because they can lap his blood. He knows, too, or ought to know, that the voices who speak to him are wiser and more worthy of attention than are his own clamorous outcries.</p>

  <p class="normal">It did not take me long to realize that I had embarked upon the life of a very great man. From that time on, still more respect for truth, closer attention, and, on my part, ever more silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a sense, every life that is recounted is offered as an example; we write in order to attack or to defend a view of the universe, and to set forth a system of conduct which is our own. It is none the less true, however, that nearly every biographer disqualifies himself by over-idealizing his subject or by deliberate disparagement, by exaggerated stress on certain details or by cautious omission of others. Thus a character is arbitrarily constructed, taking the place of the man to be understood and explained. A human life cannot be graphed, whatever people may say, by two virtual perpendiculars, representing what a man believed himself to be and what he wished to be, plus a flat horizontal for what he actually was; rather, the diagram has to be composed of three curving lines, extended to infinity, ever meeting and ever diverging.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whatever one does, one always rebuilds the monument in his own way. But it is already something gained to have used only the original stones.</p>

  <p class="normal">Every being who has gone through the adventure of living <i>is</i> myself.</p>

  <p class="normal">This Second Century appeals to me because it was the last century, for a very long period of time, in which men could think and express themselves with full freedom. As for us, we are perhaps already very far from such times as that.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the 26th of December, 1950, on an evening of freezing cold and in the almost polar silence of Mount Desert Island, off the Atlantic shore, I was striving to live again through the smothering heat of a day in July, in the year 138 in Baiae, to feel the weight of a sheet on weary, heavy limbs, and to catch the barely perceptible sound of that tideless sea as from time to time it reached a man whose whole attention was concentrated upon other murmurs, those of his approaching death. I tried to go as far as the last sip of water, the last spasm of pain, the last image in his mind. Now the emperor had but to die.</p>

  <p class="normal">This book bears no dedication. It ought to have been dedicated to G.F. . . , and would have been, were there not a kind of impropriety in putting a personal inscription at the opening of a work where, precisely, I was trying to efface the personal. But even the longest dedication is too short and too commonplace to honor a friendship so uncommon. When I try to define this asset which has been mine now for years, I tell myself that such a privilege, however rare it may be, is surely not unique; that in the whole adventure of bringing a book successfully to its conclusion, or even in the entire life of some fortunate writers, there must have been sometimes, in the background, perhaps, someone who will not let pass the weak or inaccurate sentence which we ourselves would retain, out of fatigue; someone who would re-read with us for the twentieth time, if need be, a questionable page; someone who takes down for us from the library shelves the heavy tomes in which we may find a helpful suggestion, and who persists in continuing to peruse them long after weariness has made us give up; someone who bolsters our courage and approves, or sometimes disputes, our ideas; who shares with us, and with equal fervor, the joys of art and of living, the endless work which both require, never easy but never dull; someone who is neither our shadow nor our reflection, nor even our complement, but simply himself; someone who leaves us ideally free, but who nevertheless obliges us to be fully what we are. <i>Hospes Comesque.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">In December, 1951, learned of the fairly recent death of the German historian Wilhelm Weber, and in April, 1952, of the death of the scholar Paul Graindor, both of whose works I have so much used. A few days ago talked with G.B. . . and J.F. . . , who had known the engraver Pierre Gusman in Rome at the time that he was drawing, with passion, all the different parts of the Villa. The feeling of belonging to a kind of <i>Gens Aelia,</i> of being, as it were, one of the throng of secretaries who had served the great man, of participating in the change of that imperial guard which poets and humanists mount in relay around any great memory. Thus (and it is doubtless the same for specialists in the study of Napoleon, or for lovers of Dante),</p>

  <p class="normal">over the ages is formed a circle of kindred spirits, moved by the same interests and sympathies, or concerned with the same problems.</p>

  <p class="normal">The pedants of comedy, Vadius and Blazius still exist, and their fat cousin Basil is ever about. Once and once only have I happened to be confronted with that mixture of insults and coarse jokes; with extracts truncated or skillfully deformed, so as to make our sentences say some absurdity which they do not say; with captious arguments built up by assertions both vague and peremptory enough to win ready credence from the reader respectful of academic trappings and lacking the time, or the desire, to look up the sources for himself. Characteristic, all of it, of a certain species which, fortunately, is rare. On the contrary, what genuine good will have so many scholars shown who could just as readily, in these times of excessive specialization, have disdained outright any literary effort at reconstruction of the past which might seem to them to trespass on their domain. . . . Too many of them have graciously, and of their own accord, taken trouble to rectify some error already in print, or to confirm a detail, support a hypothesis, expedite new research, for me not to express here a word of gratitude to such well-disposed readers. Each book which sees a new edition owes something to the discriminating people who have read it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Do the best one can. Do it over again. Then still improve, even if ever so slightly, those retouches. "It is myself that I re-make," said the poet Yeats in speaking of his revisions.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yesterday, at the Villa, I thought of the thousands of lives, silent and furtive as those of wild beasts, unthinking as those of plants, who have followed in succession here between Hadrian's time and ours: gypsies of Piranesi's day, pillagers of the ruins, beggars, goatherds, and peasants lodged as best they could in some corner of the rubble. At the end of an olive grove, in an ancient corridor partly cleared, G . . . and I came upon a shepherd's bed of rushes, with his improvised clothes-peg stuck between two blocks of Roman cement, and the ashes of his fire not yet cold. A sense of intimacy with humble, ordinary things, a little like what one feels at the Louvre when, after closing hour, the cots of the guardians appear in among the statues.</p>

  <p class="normal"><i>*[Nothing need be changed in 1958 in the preceding paragraph; the clothes-peg of the shepherd is still there, though not his bed. G . . . and I have again sat resting on the grass of the Vale of Tempe, among the violets, at that sacred moment of the year when everything begins anew, in spite of the threats which man today is everywhere raising overhead. But nevertheless the Villa has suffered pernicious change. Not all of it, to be sure: a whole which the centuries have slowly destroyed, but have also formed, is not so quickly altered. By an error seldom committed in Italy certain dubious "embellishments" have followed in the wake of excavations and necessary repairs. Olive groves have been cut down to make way for a highly conspicuous parking lot, complete with shop and counter service of the type prevalent at exposition grounds, thus transforming the Poecilium's noble solitude into a city square; visitors may drink from a cement fountain which offers water through an absurd plaster mask, a would-be imitation of the antique; another mask, even more point</i><i>less, decorates the wall of the great pool, where a flotilla of ducks now holds forth. Still more plaster graces the Canal: casts of the garden statues found here in recent diggings have been placed on pedestals and lined up somewhat arbitrarily along its banks; the originals, fairly average Greco-Roman work, do not deserve the honor of so conspicuous a position, but neither do they merit the indignity of being copied in such hideous material, both swollen and unsubstantial. This new decor gives to the once melancholy Canopus something of the air of a studio set, ready for a film version of "life in Imperial Rome".</i></p>

  <p class="normal calibre5 sgc-3">There is nothing more easily destroyed than the equilibrium of the fairest places. A text remains intact regardless of our whims of interpretation, and survives our commentaries; but the slightest imprudence inflicted upon stone, the shortest macadamized road cut through a field where grass has peacefully grown for centuries, does something irreparable, and for ever. The beauty goes, and the authenticity likewise.]</p>

  <p class="normal"><i>*</i> Addition of 1958.</p>

  <p class="normal">There are places where one has chosen to live, invisible abodes which one makes for oneself quite outside the current of time. I have lived in Tibur, and shall die there, perhaps, as Hadrian did on Achilles' Isle.</p>

  <p class="normal">No. Once more I have gone back to the Villa, to its garden pavillions built for privacy and for repose, to the vestiges of a luxury free of pomp, and as little imperial as possible, conceived of rather for the wealthy connoisseur who tries to combine the pleasures of art with the charms of rural life. In the Pantheon I have watched for the exact spot where sunlight would fall on a morning of April 21, and along the Mausoleum's halls have retraced that funeral path so often walked by the friends of the emperor's last days, Chabrias, Diotimus, and Celer. But I have ceased to feel the immediate presence of those beings, the living reality of those events; they are near me still, but of the past, neither more nor less now than the memories of my own life. Our commerce with others does not long endure; it ceases once satisfaction is obtained, the lesson learned, the service rendered, the book complete. What I could say has been said; what I could learn has been learned. Let us turn, for the time that is left to us, to other work.</p>

  <p class="normal calibre5 sgc-3">MARGUERITE YOURCENAR</p>

  <p class="normal">Memoirs of Hadrian</p>

  <p class="normal">Followed by <i>Reflections on the Composition of Memoirs of Hadrian</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Translated from the French by GRACE FRICK in collaboration with the Author</p>

  <p class="normal">This novel, unique in its approach to a figure from Roman history, has had international acclaim from the time that it first appeared, in France. It has already been translated into fourteen languages of Europe and Asia. Written in the form of a testamentary letter from the Emperor Hadrian to his successor, the youthful Marcus Aurelius, the work is as extraordinary for its psychological depth as for its accurate reconstruction of the second century of our era. The author describes the book as a meditation upon history, but this meditation is built upon intensive study of the personal and political life of a great and complex character as seen by himself and by his contemporaries, both friends and enemies. In a prose as firm as that of the great Latin stylists of his time, Hadrian's arduous early years, his triumphs and reversals, his gradual re-ordering of a war-torn world are reconstructed with an imaginative insight which only years in the company of the Emperor could give.</p>

  <p class="normal">Marguerite Yourcenar writes only in French. She is the author of some fifteen books varying in range from art and literary criticism to novels historical and modern, and to drama, poetry, and translation (from English and from ancient and modern Greek). As widely travelled as the Emperor of whom she writes, she was born in Brussels of French parents and has lived in several countries of Europe, but is now an American citizen, making her home since 1950 on Mount Desert Island, Maine.</p>

  <p class="normal">In January 1981, Mme Yourcenar became the first woman to be elected to the prestigious French Academy, a measure of the extraordinary place she holds in the history of French letters.</p>
