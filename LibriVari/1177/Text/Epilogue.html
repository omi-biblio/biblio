  <p class="chapt">EPILOGUE</p>

  <h1 id="toc_id_76">THE AFTERMATH</h1>

  <p class="normal">For more than three hundred years during the Late Bronze Age— from about the time of Hatshepsut’s reign beginning about 1500 BC until the collapse of multiple civilizations after 1200 BC— the Mediterranean region played host to a complex international world in which Minoans, Mycenaeans, Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Mitannians, Canaanites, Cypriots, and Egyptians all interacted, creating a cosmopolitan and globalized system of a type only rarely seen before the current day. This very internationalism may have contributed to the apocalyptic disaster that ended the Bronze Age. The cultures of the Near East, Egypt, and Greece seem to have been so intertwined and interdependent by 1177 BC that the fall of one ultimately brought down the Others, as, one after another, the flourishing civilizations were destroyed by acts of man or nature, or a lethal combination of both.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, even after all that has been said, we must acknowledge our inability to determine with certainty the precise cause (or causes) for the collapse of civilizations and the transition from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. Nor can we definitively identify the origins and motivations of the Sea Peoples who may have been involved in the destruction of some of these civilizations. Many readers of the first edition of this book expressed a desire for a conclusive answer as to which event was preeminent in the Collapse. But it is simply not possible to answer that question, at least not at this time on the basis of the available evidence. To my mind, that makes this topic not only of continuing interest but also, perhaps, of relevance to today.</p>

  <p class="normal">In these pages, therefore, I have followed the approach which says that even if we cannot offer an irrefutable “final truth,” we can at least strive to pre sent our best understanding of what occurred in the past, with the caveat that these views are necessarily subject to change, as new discoveries emerge. Adam Izdebski, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, and his colleagues have summed up this type of situation well: “During the last four decades, humanities scholars with an interest in the past have become increasingly aware that the goal of their work is to offer pos sib le narratives (“stories”) about the human past rather than arriving at any final truths. While these narratives are limited by the rules that govern their construction, they remain powerful tools that can be used to visualize the past and make it relevant to the society of the present. It is through these narratives that historians analyse and explain the complex socio-cultural worlds of the societies that preceded our own age.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref474" href="Notes.html#_ftn474" title="474">[474]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In addition to the artifacts that are found in the course of an archaeological dig, we have seen in these pages that it is through writing that we have tangible, concrete evidence for the interconnectedness and globalization of these regions, and for the growth and evolution of civilizations over the centuries. Especially important, particularly in terms of explicit relationships between specific individuals named in the letters, is the archive at Amarna in Egypt, from the time of the pharaohs Amenhotep III and Akhenaten in the mid-fourteenth century BC, as well as the archives at Ugarit in north Syria during the late thirteenth and early twelfth centuries and those at Hattusa in Anatolia during the fourteenth– twelfth centuries. The letters that we have looked at in these various archives document the fact that numerous types of networks were in simultaneous existence in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean region during the Late Bronze Age, including diplomatic networks, commercial networks, transportation networks, and communication networks, all of which were needed to keep the globalized economy of that time functioning and flowing smoothly. The interruption, or even partial dismantling, of those related networks would have had a disastrous effect back then, just as it would on our world today.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, because one of the givens in archaeology is that we are continuously making new discoveries, it is not impossible that we may someday find evidence for a single answer— the smoking gun that will definitively reveal the cause of the Collapse—or else conclusive evidence that, as I believe, there was no single cause. Imagine, for instance, a future discovery of relevant texts at other sites destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age— texts like those we have from Ugarit, where we are able to document events and life before, during, and after the destruction of the city. The Linear B tablets found so far at the Mycenaean sites in Greece document only internal accounting of items rather than international trade or narratives of events, while the texts from Hattusa in Anatolia that have been translated so far do not shed light on its final days. But just think what we might learn if we had more letters like the one found in the burned remains of the king’s palace at Qatna in Syria, dating to about 1340 BC, which was sent by Hanutti, the commander in chief of the Hittite army under Suppiluliuma, telling King Idanda of Qatna to prepare for war.</p>

  <p class="normal">If we had such textual evidence in addition to the archaeological data at sites like Megiddo, Hazor, and Lachish, for instance, then we would know far more about what happened in the decades after 1200 BC than we do now. Until such texts are found, though, we can only debate the possibilities. Such is the nature of archaeology—an ongoing mystery tale whose plot slowly unfolds.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, if we pull together the threads of evidence that have been presented throughout our discussions, there are some things that we can say about this pivotal period with relative confidence. For instance, we have reasonably good evidence that at least some international contacts and perhaps trade continued until the sudden end of the era, and possibly even beyond.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref475" href="Notes.html#_ftn475" title="475">[475]</a></sup></span> This is shown, for instance, by the last letters in the Ugaritic archives documenting contacts with Cyprus, Egypt, the Hittites, and the Aegean, as well as by the gifts sent by the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah to the king of Ugarit just a few decades, at most, before the city was destroyed. There is no evidence of a discernible decrease in contact and trade— except perhaps for brief fluctuations in intensity— across the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean until the troubles began.</p>

  <p class="normal">But then, the world they had known for more than three centuries suddenly collapsed and essentially vanished. As we have seen, the end of the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean regions, an area that extended from Italy and Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, was a fluid event that took place over the course of several decades and perhaps even up to a century.</p>

  <p class="normal">Furthermore, we have firm evidence that it took additional decades, and even centuries in some areas, for the people in these regions to rebuild and reclaim their societies, and to forge new lives that would bring them back up out of the darkness into which they had been plunged. Jack Davis of the University of Cincinnati has pointed out, for instance, that “the destruction to the Palace of Nestor ca. 1180 BC was so devastating that neither the palace nor the community subsequently recovered... Th e area of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos remained... severely depopulated for nearly a millennium.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref476" href="Notes.html#_ftn476" title="476">[476]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Joseph Maran, of the University of Heidelberg, has further noted that, although we don’t know how contemporaneous the final destructions actually were in Greece, it is clear that after the catastrophes were over, «there were no palaces, the use of writing as well as all administrative structures came to an end, and the concept of a supreme ruler, the <span class="italic">wanax</span>, dis appeared from the range of political institutions of Ancient Greece.” <span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref477" href="Notes.html#_ftn477" title="477">[477]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In terms of the relative or complete disappearance of literacy and writing, the same holds true for Ugarit and some other societies that had flourished in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age. With the end of these civilizations, the use of cuneiform writing also came to an end in the Levant, replaced by other, perhaps more useful or convenient, writing systems.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref478" href="Notes.html#_ftn478" title="478">[478]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">In addition to the loss of populations and the collapse of ordinary buildings and palaces alike, it seems likely that there was a loss, or at least a significant decline, in the relationships among the various kingdoms of the region. Even if not all of the places collapsed at exactly the same time, by the mid-twelfth century BC they had lost their interconnectedness and the globalization that had previously existed, especially during the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries BC. As Marc Van De Mieroop of Columbia University has said, the elites lost the international framework and the diplomatic contacts that had supported them, at the same time as foreign goods and ideas stopped arriving.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref479" href="Notes.html#_ftn479" title="479">[479]</a></sup></span> They now had to start afresh.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the world emerged from the Bronze Age Collapse, it was a new age. There were new opportunities for growth of other peoples and societies, particularly with the demise of the Hittites and the decline of the Egyptians, who, in addition to ruling their own regions, had also between them controlled most of Syria and Canaan for much of the Late Bronze Age.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref480" href="Notes.html#_ftn480" title="480">[480]</a></sup></span> Although there was a certain amount of continuity in some areas, particularly with the Neo-Assyrians in Mesopotamia, overall it was time for a new set of powers and a fresh start with new civilizations, including the Neo-Hittites in southeastern Anatolia, north Syria, and points farther east; the Phoenicians, Philistines, and Israelites in what had once been Canaan; and the Greeks in geometric, archaic, and then classical Greece. Out of the ashes of the old world came the alphabet and other inventions, not to mention a dramatic increase in the use of iron, which gave its name to the new era— the Iron Age. It is a cycle that the world has seen time and time again, and that many have come to believe is an inexorable process: the rise and fall of empires, followed by the rise of new empires, which eventually fall and are replaced in turn by even newer empires, in a repeated cadence of birth, growth and evolution, decay or destruction, and ultimately renewal in a new form.</p>

  <p class="normal">One pair of scholars has suggested that the Collapse might actually have been a blessing in disguise for many of the people on mainland Greece, for instance, where the costly building projects undertaken by the Mycenaean kingdoms ca. 1250 BC had already strained the economy to its breaking point. As they put it, in Greece the Collapse may have provided “the window of opportunity needed to ‘escape’ from an unsustainable socio-political structure.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref481" href="Notes.html#_ftn481" title="481">[481]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">One of the most interesting and fertile fields of current research on the ancient world lies in the consideration of what happens after civilizations collapse— “beyond collapse” as it were.<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref482" href="Notes.html#_ftn482" title="482">[482]</a></sup></span> One example of such research is the work of William Dever, professor emeritus at the University of Arizona and Distinguished Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at Lycoming College, who said of the period after the Collapse in the region of Canaan: “Perhaps the most important conclusion to be drawn about the ‘Dark Age’... is that it was nothing of the sort. Gradually being illuminated by archaeological discovery and research, [this period] emerges rather as the catalyst of a new age— one that would build upon the ruins of Canaanite civilization and would bequeath to the modern Western world a cultural heritage, especially through the Phoenicians and Israelites.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref483" href="Notes.html#_ftn483" title="483">[483]</a></sup></span></p>

  <p class="normal">Moreover, as Christopher Monroe recently stated, “all civilizations eventually experience violent restructuring of material and ideological realities such as destruction or re-creation.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref484" href="Notes.html#_ftn484" title="484">[484]</a></sup></span> We see this in the constant rise and fall of empires in this region over time, including the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, Neo-Assyrians, Neo-Babylonians, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Muslims, Ottomans, and others, and we should not think that our current world is invincible, for we are in fact more susceptible than we might wish to believe.</p>

  <p class="normal">If we keep in mind events that have taken place quite recently, from Greece’s economy tanking a de cade ago to internal rebellions engulfing Libya, Egypt, and Syria during and subsequent to the Arab Spring, and refugees still fleeing the civil war in Syria today, and then compare them with the events that took place in the same area during the years around 1177 BC, there is an uncomfortable similarity. While the 2008 collapse of Wall Street in the United States pales in comparison to the collapse of the entire Late Bronze Age Mediterranean world, there were those who warned that something similar could take place if the banking institutions with a global reach were not bailed out immediately. For instance, the <span class="italic">Washington Post</span> quoted Robert B. Zoellick, then the president of the World Bank, as saying that “the global financial system may have reached a ‘tipping point,’” which he defined as “the moment when a crisis cascades into a full-blown meltdown and becomes extremely difficult for governments to contain.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref485" href="Notes.html#_ftn485" title="485">[485]</a></sup></span> In a complex system such as our world today, this is all it might take for the overall system to become destabilized, leading to a collapse.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the survey released in February 2020 cited at the beginning of this book, one respondent noted the interrelatedness of the factors involved in our own current world situation, writing: “While extreme climate events are weakening the societal governance and infrastructure, food and water security will become more and more serious, causing large-scale immigration and further inequity. If several geopolitical crises occur in parallel, many states cannot handle the situation properly, due to lack of resources and with the internal conflict, it would cause catastrophic outcomes all over the world.”<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref486" href="Notes.html#_ftn486" title="486">[486]</a></sup></span> The parallels between events in our modern world and what happened during the Bronze Age Collapse in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean were already readily apparent, but now we need also to take into consideration the catastrophic direct effects of the COVID-19 virus and the ripple effects of the contagion on financial and economic systems that went global at about the same time as the release of the survey.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_id_77">What If?</h3>

  <p class="normal">The period of the Late Bronze Age has rightfully been hailed as one of the golden ages in the history of the world, and as a period during which an early global economy successfully flourished. So we might ask, would the history of the world have taken a different turn, or followed a different path, if the civilizations in these regions had not come to an end? What if the series of earthquakes in Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean had not taken place? What if there had been no drought, no famine, no mi grants or invaders? Would the Late Bronze Age have eventually come to an end anyway, since all civilizations seem to rise and fall? Would any of the developments that followed have eventually come about no matter what? Would progress have continued? Would additional advances in technology, literature, and politics have been made centuries earlier than they actually were?</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course, these are rhetorical questions, and ones that cannot be answered, because the Bronze Age civilizations <i>did</i> come to an end and development <i>did</i> essentially have to begin completely anew in areas from Greece to the Levant and beyond. As a result, new peoples and/or new city-states like the Israelites, Aramaeans, and Phoenicians in the Eastern Mediterranean, and later the Athenians and Spartans in Greece, were able to establish themselves. From them eventually came fresh developments and innovative ideas, such as the alphabet, monotheistic religion, and eventually democracy.</p>

  <p class="normal">In an interview for an article that appeared soon after the publication of the first edition of this book,<span class="refnota"><sup><a id="_ftnref487" href="Notes.html#_ftn487" title="487">[487]</a></sup></span> Adam Frank of NPR asked me, “<span class="italic">If we don’t want to be repeating history, what lessons should we be learning from their mistakes?</span>” I replied to him that we should be aware that no society is invulnerable, and that every society in the history of the world has ultimately collapsed. I also said that the collapse of similarly intertwined civilizations just after 1200 BC should be a warning to us that it can certainly happen again. Simply put, if we are aware of serious problems on the horizon that can affect the world order, such as climate change, it behooves us to take steps to fix them as best we can and as soon as we can.</p>

  <p class="normal">I should hasten to add that, although it’s clear that climate change and such factors as pandemics have caused instability in the past, there is at least one major difference between then and now— concurrent knowledge of events unfolding. The ancient Hittites probably had no idea what was happening to them. They didn’t know how to stop a drought. Maybe they prayed to the gods; perhaps they made some sacrifices. But in the end, they were essentially powerless to do anything about it.</p>

  <p class="normal">In contrast, we are now much more technologically advanced. We also have the advantage of hindsight. History has a lot to teach us, but only if we are willing to listen and learn. If we see the same sort of things taking place now that happened in the past, including drought and famine, earthquakes and tsunamis, then I ask again, might it not be a good idea to look at the ancient world and learn from what happened to them? Even if the various problems at the end of the Late Bronze Age were “black swan” events, as Magnus Nordenman has suggested, the mere fact that we have so many similar problems at the pre sent time should be cause for concern.</p>

  <p class="normal">When I told Adam Frank that we should be thankful that, unlike the Hittites, we are now advanced enough to understand what is happening and can take steps to fix things, his rejoinder was short and direct: “<i>But are we advanced enough to do anything with our understanding?</i>” It remains to be seen whether we will have a good answer to his question. </p>
