  <h1 id="toc_id_79">Acknowledgments</h1>

  <p class="normal">I had long been wanting to write a book like this, and so, first and foremost, my heartfelt thanks go once again to Rob Tempio, who treated me to lunch back in 2007 and asked me to write a book about the Collapse. I told him that I would do it, but that I wanted to write about <span class="italic">what</span> collapsed as well as how and why it collapsed, because to me the Late Bronze Age is the most fascinating period in the history of the world. Fortunately, he agreed. As a result, the beginning and ending of this book are about the Collapse, while the middle part is all about the various civilizations that flourished in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean and their achievements during the second half of the second millennium BC. I remain very pleased that it was chosen as the first book in the Turning Points in Ancient History series published by Prince ton University Press, under the direction of Barry Strauss and Rob Tempio, and that we are now able to offer an updated and revised edition.</p>

  <p class="normal">I am also indebted to the University Facilitating Fund of The George Washington University for summer stipend money, and to numerous friends and colleagues, including Assaf Yasur-Landau, Israel Finkelstein, David Ussishkin, Mario Liverani, Kevin McGeough, Reinhard Jung, Cemal Pulak, Shirly Ben-Dor Evian, Sarah Parcak, Ellen Morris, and Jeffrey Blomster, with whom I have had rewarding conversations about relevant topics. I would also like to specifically thank Carol Bell, Reinhard Jung, Kevin McGeough, Jana Mynárřová, Gareth Roberts, Kim Shelton, Neil Silberman, and Assaf Yasur-Landau for sending materials upon request or providing detailed answers to specific questions, and Randy Helm, Louise Hitchcock, Amanda Podany, Barry Strauss, Jim West, and two anonymous reviewers for reading and commenting upon the entire manuscript. Thanks also go to the National Geographic Society, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Egypt Exploration Society for permission to reproduce some of the figures that appear in this book. Finally, and specifically in regard to this revised and updated edition, I would like to thank Miroslav Bárta, Trevor Bryce, Yoram Cohen, Brandon Lee Drake, Martin Finné, John Haldon, Jim Harrell, Héctor Hinojosa-Prieto, Luke Kemp, Mark Macklin, Neil Roberts, Eelco Rohling, and Assaf Yasur-Landau for variously providing me with information, copies of their publications, and feedback on my interpretations and pre sen ta tions of their findings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Much of the material in this book represents an up-to-date and accessible rendition of my research and publications on international relations during the Late Bronze Age that have appeared over the course of the past three decades or so, in addition to presenting, of course, the research and conclusions of many other scholars. Grateful thanks therefore also go to the editors and publishers of the various journals and edited volumes in which some of my previous relevant articles and publications have appeared, for their permission to reproduce that material here, albeit usually altered and updated. These include especially David Davison of Tempus Reparatum/Archaeopress, as well as Jack Meinhardt and <i>Archaeology Odyssey</i> magazine; James R. Mathieu and <i>Expedition</i> magazine; Virginia Webb and the <i>Annual of the British School at Athens</i>; Mark Cohen and CDL Press; Tom Palaima and <i>Minos</i>; Robert Laffineur and the Aegaeum series; Ed White and Recorded Books/Modern Scholar; Garrett Brown and the National Geographic Society; and Angelos Chaniotis and Mark Chavalas, among others. I have made every attempt to clearly document within the endnotes and bibliography the publications in which my previous discussions of the data presented here may be found. Any phrasing or other borrowing, from either my own previous publications or those by any other scholar, that remains unattributed is purely unintentional and will be rectified in future printings and editions, as necessary.</p>

  <p class="normal">And last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank my wife, Diane, for many stimulating conversations about various aspects of this material and for creating some of the images used here. I would also like to thank both her and our children for their patience while I worked on both editions of this book. As always, the text has benefited from the firm editing and critical feedback of my father, Martin J. Cline.</p>
