  <div class="normal1">
    <b>T</b>he offices of the US Fish and Wildlife Service Wolf Recovery team were on the third floor of a plain red-brick building in a quiet part of Helena. There was no sign outside that told you this and if there had been it probably wouldn’t have lasted long. There were people around here who didn’t much like any federal agency, least of all one whose sole purpose was to protect a creature they considered the most loathsome God ever came up with. Dan Prior and his team knew from experience that when it came to wolves it was best to keep the profile low.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">In the outer office stood a glass case from which a stuffed wolf looked, more or less benignly, on their labors. The plaque on the side of the case said its occupant was <i>Canis Lupus Irremotus, Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf</i>. But, for a reason no one in the office could now recall, the wolf was more informally known as Fred.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan had gotten into the habit of talking to Fred, particularly on those long nights when everyone else had gone home, leaving him to unpick yet another political tangle in which Fred’s more animated brethren had snagged him. On such occasions Dan would often come up with other, more vibrant names for his silent companion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tonight was definitely not going to be one of those nights. In fact Dan, for the first time in living memory, was leaving early. He had a date. And because he’d made the mistake of mentioning it, everyone in the office had been teasing him about it all week. As he came out of his office, stuffing some papers into his bag, they all chanted in rehearsed unison, ‘Have a nice time, Dan!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank you very much indeed,’ he said, through clenched teeth. Everyone laughed. ‘Will someone tell me, what’s so goddamn fascinating about my private life?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Donna, his assistant, grinned at him. She was a big, gutsy woman in her late thirties, who ran the office with a calm good humor that even in the most frenzied moments never seemed to desert her. She shrugged.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I guess it’s just that you never had one till now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re all fired.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He gave them a dismissive wave, told Fred to wipe that grin off his face and was just reaching for the doorknob when the phone rang.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m gone,’ he mouthed to Donna and out he went.</p>

  <p class="normal">He pushed the elevator button and waited while the cables clunked and whirred behind the stainless-steel doors. There was a ping and the doors opened.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dan!’</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited with his finger on the button, keeping the doors open, while Donna hurried down the corridor toward him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know that new private life of yours?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know, Donna? I was just thinking of giving you a raise.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry, but I thought you’d want to know. That was a rancher called Clyde Hicks from Hope. He says a wolf just tried to kill his baby boy.’</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    Twenty minutes and half a dozen phone calls later, Dan was in his car and on his way to Hope. Four of the calls were to game wardens, Forest Service rangers and other Fish and Wildlife people in case any of them had heard anything about wolf activity in the Hope area. None had. The fifth was to predator-control agent Bill Rimmer, asking him to meet him in Hope to do a necropsy on the dog.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">The last call was to the lovely and formidable Sally Peters, the newly divorced marketing director of a local cattle feed company. It had taken Dan all of two months to summon the courage to ask her out. After her reaction just now when he’d told her he wasn’t able to make dinner, next time, if there was one, it would take longer.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was about an hour’s drive from Helena to Hope and as he swung west off the interstate toward the mountains, now darkening against the pale pink of the sky, Dan reflected on why it was that anyone who worked with wolves ended up getting screwed by them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Over the years, he’d met a lot of biologists who specialized in other animals, from pygmy shrews to penguins, and though there were one or two damaged souls among them, on the whole they seemed able to stumble well enough through life like the rest of humanity. But wolf biologists were walking disaster areas.</p>

  <p class="normal">In every league - divorce, nervous breakdown, suicide - they came out tops. By these standards, Dan himself had nothing to be ashamed of. His marriage had lasted nearly sixteen years. It was probably some kind of record. And even if Mary, his ex, didn’t speak to him, Ginny, their daughter - who was fourteen, going on twenty - thought he was an okay dad. Hell, she adored him; and it was mutual. But apart from Ginny, what, really, at the age of forty-one, did he have to show for all these years of devotion to the welfare of wolves?</p>

  <p class="normal">To avoid answering his own question, he leaned forward and switched on the radio. Hopping through the commercials and the relentless country music (which, after three years in Montana, he still hadn’t learned to like), he settled on the local news. The last item did little to improve his mood.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was about a ‘wolf attack’ on a ranch near Hope and how the baby grandson of one of the community’s most prominent figures, Buck Calder, had only escaped certain death because a pet Labrador had bravely laid down his life instead.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan groaned. The media had it already. That was <i>all</i> he needed. But it got worse. They already had a phone interview with Calder himself. Dan knew of him but had never met him. He had the deep, seductive voice of a politician. All daggers dripping with honey.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The federal government let loose all those wolves down there in Yellowstone and now they’re everywhere and threatening mothers and babies. And are we allowed to defend them and defend our livestock and our property? No sir, we are not. And why’s that? Because the federal government tells us these animals are still an endangered species. I tell you, there’s no more sense than justice in it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The report ended and Dan switched off.</p>

  <p class="normal">The guy had a point. Until recently, the only wolves in the region had been the few that had ventured down the continental divide from Canada. Then, after years of furious debate between environmentalists and ranchers, the federal government decided to give wolf recovery a boost. At huge expense, some sixty-six wild Canadian wolves were captured, trucked to Yellowstone Park and Idaho, and released.</p>

  <p class="normal">In response to local anger, ranchers who lived in these so-called experimental areas were allowed to shoot any wolf they found attacking their livestock. But the released wolves had multiplied and because they weren’t too good at reading maps (or perhaps because they were), they had spread to places where shooting them earned you a $100,000 fine and even a spell in jail.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hope was one of these places. What’s more, it was wolf-hater heartland. If a wolf had indeed shown up there today, it needed its head examined.</p>

  <p class="normal">About ten years ago, Fish and Wildlife had held public meetings all over the state so that people could vent their feelings about federal proposals for wolf recovery. Some of these meetings had apparently gotten pretty stormy. But the one they’d held in Hope community hall beat all records.</p>

  <p class="normal">A group of young ranch hands and loggers had stood outside with guns and yelled abuse all the way through. Those inside, where guns were banned, were just as scary. Dan’s predecessor, a legendary diplomat, had managed to keep the lid on. But afterward, two loggers had shoved him against a wall and threatened him. He came out several shades paler than he’d gone in, only to find someone had poured a gallon of red paint over his car.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the far distance now, Dan saw the town looming.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was the kind of town you could drive through and barely know you’d been there. One straight street, a couple of hundred yards long, fishboned with a few side alleys. At one end stood a rundown motel and at the other a school, and in between you could find a gas station, a grocery, a hardware store, a diner, a laundromat and a taxidermist.</p>

  <p class="normal">Many of the town’s five hundred or so population lived scattered along the valley and to service their various spiritual needs there were two churches and two bars. There were also two gift shops, which said more about optimism than sound business sense; for although summer tourists often passed through Hope, few chose to linger.</p>

  <p class="normal">In an attempt to remedy this and to meet demand from the modest but growing band of subdivision newcomers, one of these shops (and by far the better) had last year installed a cappuccino bar.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shop was called Paragon and on those rare occasions when Dan was passing through, he always made a point of dropping in, not so much on account of the coffee, which was good, as of the woman who owned it.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was a handsome New Yorker called Ruth Michaels and, from their two or three encounters, he’d so far established that she used to run an art gallery in Manhattan and had come to Montana on vacation after her marriage broke up. She’d fallen in love with the place and stayed. Dan could imagine knowing a lot more about her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Cappuccino hadn’t exactly taken off with the locals who mostly preferred their coffee weak and stewed, the way they did it over the street at Nelly’s Diner. As he drove by, Dan was sad, but not altogether surprised, to see Ruth had a FOR SALE sign stuck in the front window.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ahead, he could see Bill Rimmer’s pickup parked where they’d arranged to meet, outside a forlorn bar, aptly named The Last Resort. Rimmer got out to greet him. He was a born and bred Montanan and with his Stetson and droopy, blond mustache, looked it. At six foot six, he always made Dan feel like a midget. He was a few years younger than Dan and better-looking too; in fact, come to think of it, Dan couldn’t figure why he liked the guy so much.</p>

  <p class="normal">He got out of his car and Rimmer slapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How’re you doing, old friend?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, Bill, tell you the truth, I had a better date than you lined up for tonight.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You could break a man’s heart, Dan Prior. Shall we head on out there?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘May as well. Everybody else is. Did you hear the radio?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yep. And I heard there’s a TV crew up there too.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Terrific.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That old wolf sure chose a good spot to make his debut.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, Bill. We don’t even know it was a wolf yet.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They climbed into Rimmer’s pickup and pulled out down Main Street. It was nearly seven-thirty and Dan was starting to worry about the light. It was always easier to check out the scene of a depredation in daylight. He was even more worried about all the people who had been trampling over the scene of the so-called wolf attack. If there were any tracks they were probably all scuffed up by now.</p>

  <p class="normal">He and Rimmer had started their jobs at virtually the same time. Their predecessors had both been centrally involved in the release program and had quit not long after for more or less the same reason. They were ‘wolfed out’ - tired of being yelled at by ranchers for not doing enough to control the spread of wolves and by environmentalists for not doing enough to help it. You simply couldn’t win.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rimmer worked for Animal Damage Control, a division of the Department of Agriculture, and was usually the first person to get the call when a rancher was having trouble with predators, be it bear, coyote, mountain lion or wolf. He was judge, jury and, where necessary, executioner. A trained biologist, he kept his love of these animals to himself. And that, along with his skill with rifle and trap, had helped him earn the respect even of those who harbored a natural mistrust of all federal employees.</p>

  <p class="normal">He dressed like a cowboy, and that, along with his easy, laconic manner, gave him the edge over Dan when it came to placating irate ranchers who’d lost (or thought they’d lost) a calf or a sheep to a wolf. To such people, Dan would always be an East Coast outsider. Their main difference, however, was that while ranchers saw Rimmer as the man who could help solve their problem, they saw Dan as the one who’d caused it. Dan always felt happier when he had Rimmer alongside, especially in situations like the one they were headed for now.</p>

  <p class="normal">They swung off the last stretch of blacktop and onto the gray gravel road that wound up the valley toward the mountains. For awhile they traveled without talking, listening to the scrunch of the car’s wheels that left a drift of dust behind them. Through the open windows the evening air was warm on Dan’s forearm. Between the road and the darkening green of the cottonwoods along the river a hawk scoured the sagebrush for an evening snack. It was Dan who broke the silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You ever hear of a wolf trying to take a baby?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nope. Likely it was the dog he was after all the time.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s what I figured. What about this Calder guy. Have you met him before?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Couple of times. He’s quite a piece of work.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s that supposed to mean?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Rimmer grinned, without looking at him, and with one finger eased the brim of his hat up his forehead a little.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ll see.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The gateway to the Calder ranch was a massive structure of weathered lodgepole, its crossbar mounted with the skull of a longhorn steer. It reminded Dan of the entrance to a wild west rollercoaster ride called the Canyon of Doom on which he and Ginny had scared themselves witless last summer in Florida.</p>

  <p class="normal">They rattled over a cattle guard and past a wooden sign that said CALDER RANCH. There was a smaller one beside it, freshly painted, which said simply HICKS. Dan assumed there was no pun intended.</p>

  <p class="normal">They drove beneath the skull and followed the road for another mile, winding among small, scrub-covered hills, until the Calder ranch house loomed ahead of them. It stood assertively on the south-facing slope of a low bluff which no doubt afforded shelter from the winter blizzards as well as a commanding view of the best pastures of the Calder domain. The house was built of stout, whitewashed timber and though it was on two stories, its great length made it seem low and anchored immutably to the land.</p>

  <p class="normal">Below it lay a wide cement yard, on one side of which stood an imposing set of freshly painted white barns, and on the other three silver feed silos which towered like missiles above a network of corrals. In the pasture that fell away beyond, a wide-crowned cottonwood grew from the shell of a Model T Ford, rusted the same shade as the horses that grazed around it. They lifted their heads to watch the pickup and its train of dust go by.</p>

  <p class="normal">They forked left and two miles farther up the road they crested another hill and saw, in the gathering dusk, the dark red shape of the Hicks’ house. Rimmer slowed so they could take in the scene.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were six or seven vehicles parked in front and though partly obscured by the corner of the house, a small crowd could be seen around the rear porch. Someone seemed to have a spotlight on and every so often there was the flash of a camera. Dan sighed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I want to go home.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure looks like a circus.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah. And here come the clowns.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I was thinking more of the Roman kind, you know, where they feed you to the lions.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thanks a lot, Bill.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They parked along with the other cars and made their way up to the house and around to the back where all the people were. Someone was talking and Dan recognized the voice right away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Up on the porch, in a flood of light, a young TV reporter was interviewing Buck Calder. She was wearing a red suit that looked a good two sizes too small for her. Calder towered above her. He was tall, almost as tall as Bill Rimmer, and much more powerfully built. His shoulders were as wide as the window behind him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wore a light-colored Stetson and a white snap-button shirt that set off his tan. His eyes gleamed a pale gray-blue in the TV lights and Dan realized it was the eyes even more than the man’s physique that gave the impression of power. They were locked on the young reporter with such smiling intensity that she seemed mesmerized. Dan had expected to see the grandfather he knew Calder to be. But here instead was a man in his prime, who clearly knew the effect his confidence had on others.</p>

  <p class="normal">Alongside him, looking a lot less comfortable, were Kathy and Clyde Hicks. Kathy was holding the baby who was staring at his grandfather, eyes wide with wonder. There was a table beside them with something bulky and yellow on it and it took Dan awhile to realize it was the dead dog.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The wolf is a killing machine,’ Calder was saying. ‘He’ll take anything he can. And if it wasn’t for this poor, brave dog here he’d have taken my little grandson. Though I reckon Buck Junior here might have given him a sock on the jaw first.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The crowd laughed. There were about a dozen people there. The photographer and a young man taking notes were from the local newspaper; Dan had seen them before. Who the others were, he had no idea. Probably neighbors and family. There were two faces that he kept going back to: a graceful woman, in her mid-forties, Dan guessed, and a tall young man, probably in his late teens, beside her. They were standing in the shadows, a little way back from the rest. Dan noticed how neither of them joined in the laughter,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Calder’s wife and son,’ Rimmer whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">The woman had thick black hair, streaked with gray and loosely pinned up to show a long, pale neck. There was a kind of melancholy beauty about her that was echoed in the face of her son.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everything had suddenly gone quiet up on the porch. The TV reporter, entranced by Calder’s gaze, had blanked. Calder grinned at her with teeth white and perfect as a movie star’s.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You going to ask me another question, sweetheart, or are we about done here?’</p>

  <p class="normal">The laughter this time made her blush. She looked around at the cameraman, who nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think we’re done,’ she said. ‘Thank you Mr Calder. Very much. That was really, really . . . great.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Calder nodded then looked over the heads to where Dan and Rimmer were standing and gave them a little wave. Everyone turned to look at them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I can see a couple of fellas over there who you might like to ask a few questions too. I know I’ve got one or two for them.’</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    From the darkness of the barn, Luke Calder looked out across the yard to where they were doing the necropsy. He was just inside the open door, kneeling beside Maddie and stroking her. She was lying with her head on her paws and every now and then she would whimper and lift her head and look up at him, licking her grizzled old lips, and Luke would stroke her some more till she settled again.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Rimmer had the Labrador laid out on clear plastic sheeting on the tailgate of his pickup. He’d rigged up some lamps so he could see what he was doing with his knife. The other guy who’d come with him, the wolf expert, was videoing it, while Luke’s father and Clyde stood to one side, looking on in silence. His mother and Kathy were inside getting supper ready. Everyone else had at last, thank God, gone home.</p>

  <p class="normal">That nightmare of a woman from the TV station had asked if she could stay and film the necropsy too but Rimmer had said no. The wolf guy, Prior, had agreed to answer a few of her dumb questions, basically telling her nothing, then politely sent her packing because they needed to get on with the job while the dog’s corpse was still fresh.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were skinning him like a deer, Rimmer talking all the while for the video, saying out loud what he was doing and what he could see. Luke could see him peeling Prince’s hide away like elastic from the bloody pink muscle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Severe internal hemorrhaging and more bite marks here at the base of the neck. Real deep puncture wounds. Can you see that Dan? Here, I’ll measure them. These incisor holes are nearly two inches apart. That’s a big animal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It must have been the alpha male, Luke thought, the big black one.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke had known for many months that there were wolves up there. He’d first heard them in the deep of winter when the backcountry lay thick with snow and he was out on his skis where he most liked to be, as far away from the world as you could get.</p>

  <p class="normal">He’d found tracks and knew at once they were too big for any coyote, and he’d followed them and found the carcass of a fresh-killed elk.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, one day in April, he’d seen the black one.</p>

  <p class="normal">First on skis, then on foot, he’d climbed to the top of a high ridge and had stopped there to rest. It was a cloudless day, still icy but with a promise of spring. And as he sat there on a rock, gazing down into the next valley, he saw the wolf trot out from the trees. It made its way across a small meadow of melting snow at the higher end of which was a slope, cluttered with sliprock and blowdown. The wolf had simply vanished into it, leaving Luke to wonder if he’d dreamed the whole episode.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was where the mother had denned. And in the weeks that followed, Luke saw the others. When the snow melted, he would ride up there, always making sure to stay downwind, tying Moon Eye a good way off and climbing to the top of the same ridge. He would slither the last few yards on his belly, with binoculars ready in his hands, elbowing his way through the rocks until he could see down into the meadow. And he would lie there for hours at a time, sometimes seeing none, sometimes all of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had told no one.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, one afternoon in the first week of May, he saw the pups. They were still fluffy and dark and none too sure of their feet and all five of them had come stumbling out from the den, blinking in the sunshine. Their mother with her drooping teats stood proudly by while the father and the two other, younger adults greeted the little ones and nuzzled them, as if welcoming them into the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward the end of June they disappeared and for awhile he was afraid someone had killed them. But then he found them again in another meadow, farther up the canyon. It seemed to Luke a safer place, fringed with trees and sloping gently to a stream where the pups would splash and wrestle. And it was there one morning that he saw one of the younger adults come trotting back from a hunting trip, looking all proud, as if he’d won the lottery or something, and all the pups came running across the meadow to greet him, jostling him and licking his face until he kind of grinned and yawned and retched up meat for them to eat, just like the books said they did.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the meadow filled with flowers, Luke watched the pups chasing bees and butterflies and learning how to hunt mice and it was often so comical he found it hard not to laugh out loud. Sometimes when their mother or their father lay dozing in the sun, the pups would stalk them, creeping on their bellies through the paintbrush and shooting stars and the lush, long grass. Luke was sure the parents knew what was going on and were just playing along, pretending to be asleep. When they got real close, the pups would pounce and everything went crazy and the whole pack would go chasing around the meadow, tumbling and nipping each other and the game would go on and on until they all collapsed in one big, exhausted heap of wolf.</p>

  <p class="normal">And witnessing this, Luke would silently say a little prayer, not to God, of whose existence he’d had scant evidence so far, but to whoever or whatever decided these things, pleading that the wolves be smart enough to stay up there where they were safe and not venture down to the valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">But now it had happened. One of them had come.</p>

  <p class="normal">And just now, watching his father lapping up the limelight on the porch, Luke had felt angry at the wolf, not for killing his sister’s dog, whom he had always loved well enough, but for being so utterly reckless with the lives of the others. Didn’t the fool of an animal know how people around here felt about wolves?</p>

  <p class="normal">His father was aware how well Luke knew the mountains, how he was always going up there, off on his own, when he should have been helping out on the ranch, like ranchers’ sons were supposed to. And earlier that evening, before all the people showed up, his father had asked him if he’d ever seen any sign of wolves up there.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke had shaken his head and, instead of leaving it at that, for some stupid reason, had tried to say no, he never had. The lie made him block on both the <i>no</i> and the <i>never</i> even worse than usual, and his father walked off before the sentence was out.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke just let it die unspoken, with the other million dead sentences he had inside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Across the yard, the necropsy was over now and Dan Prior had turned off his camera and was helping Rimmer clean up. Luke’s father and Clyde stepped closer and the four men started to talk, their voices low, so that Luke could no longer hear. He gave the old dog one last stroke, stood up and walked out of the barn toward them, stopping a short way off in the hope that no one would spot him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, there’s no doubt it was a wolf,’ Rimmer said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke’s father laughed. ‘Was there any doubt before? My daughter saw it with her own eyes. I reckon she can tell a wolf from a woodpecker.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sure she can, sir.’</p>

  <p class="normal">His father caught sight of him and Luke cussed himself for leaving the barn.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Gentlemen, this is my son, Luke. Luke, this here’s Mr Prior and Mr Rimmer.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Fighting an instinct to turn and run, Luke walked over and shook hands with them. They both said hi but Luke just nodded, avoiding their eyes in case they tried to get him to talk. As usual, his father steamed right on with the conversation, simultaneously rescuing him and consigning him to yet another failure. Luke knew the real reason his father always stepped in so smartly; he didn’t like folks knowing he had a stutterer for a son.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So, how come you fellas never told us there were wolves around here?’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Prior who answered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, Mr Calder, we’ve always known wolves do sometimes travel along the continental divide. As you know, there’s a growing population of them in the state—’</p>

  <p class="normal">His father gave a mocking laugh. ‘I had heard tell.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And as they do travel, sometimes, quite long distances, it’s not always easy to know where they all are at any given time or—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I thought you were supposed to have radio collars on them all.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Some, yes sir, but not all. Your daughter’s pretty sure this one didn’t have a collar. We’ve had no indication, until today that is, of any wolf activity in this area. This one may be a disperser, a single wolf who’s broken away from some other pack, maybe many miles from here. Maybe he’s hanging out with others that are collared. That’s what we’re going to try and find out. In fact, as of tomorrow morning, we’ll be out there looking.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I surely hope so, Mr Prior. And so does Clyde here, as you can imagine.’ He put his arm around his son-in-law’s shoulders. Clyde didn’t look too comfortable about it, but managed a stern nod.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What are you planning on doing once you’ve found them?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think we need to know a little more before we decide on that,’ Prior said. ‘I can sure appreciate how upset you must be, but if it’s any consolation, there’s never been a case anywhere in North America of a healthy wild wolf killing a human being.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is that a fact?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes sir. In all probability this one was only ever after the dog. It’s kind of a territorial thing.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh is it now? Tell me, Mr Prior, where do you come from?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I live in Helena, sir.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, I mean originally. Where you were born and grew up. Somewhere back east is my guess.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, as a matter of fact. I come from Pittsburgh.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Pittsburgh. Hmm. Grew up in the city.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes sir, I did.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So that’s <i>your</i> territory?’</p>
