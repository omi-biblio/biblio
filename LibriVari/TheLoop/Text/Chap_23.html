  <div class="normal1">
    <b>T</b>he two weeks that followed Abe Harding’s arrest were the toughest of Dan Prior’s entire career and by a long way the most bizarre. As if in revenge for the killing of the alpha male in Hope, wolf packs throughout the region seemed suddenly to be wreaking havoc.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">A sheep rancher north of Yellowstone lost thirty-one lambs in one night to wolves that had wandered out of the park. They ate hardly anything, simply killed them and left them. Another pack killed a pair of thoroughbred foals just east of Glacier. And a lone disperser, from a pack in Idaho, killed three calves near the Salmon River and left a fourth so badly maimed that it had to be put down.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bill Rimmer was hardly ever out of his helicopter. In ten days he shot and killed nine wolves and darted fifteen more, mainly pups, who were relocated where they would hopefully keep out of trouble. It was Dan who had to sign the death warrants and he did so each time with a sense of personal failure. He was supposed to be in charge of wolf recovery, not liquidation. He had little choice, however. Being prepared to use ‘lethal control’ was a firm promise in the plan that had allowed wolf recovery to happen in the first place. And because of what had happened in Hope, the media was watching his every move.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reporters were calling him every hour of the day. At home he left the answering machine on all the time, except those nights Ginny stayed when she answered for him and pretended to be a Chinese takeout or a home for the criminally insane, which wasn’t too wide of the mark. At the office, Donna handled most of the media calls, only putting through to Dan those journalists he knew or those who might be important.</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t only the local media who’d suddenly renewed their interest in wolves, it was national and even international people too. There was one call from a German TV reporter who kept talking about Nietzsche and asking all kinds of deep philosophical questions Dan couldn’t understand, let alone answer. More surreal still was the guy from <i>Time</i> magazine who said they were thinking of doing a cover story on Abe Harding.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is this a joke?’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, of course not.’ The reporter sounded hurt. ‘Isn’t he, in a way, making a last stand for the values of the Old West? Don’t you see him that way, you know, as a kind of beleaguered pioneer?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can I tell you off-the-record?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure. Go ahead.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I see him more as a kind of beleaguered asshole.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The idea of ‘Abe Harding, Last Pioneer’, on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine had Dan chuckling and shaking his head for days. Thank the Lord, the piece had yet to materialize, probably because it would require at least a modicum of cooperation from Abe himself; and reporters, on Abe’s scale of preferences, would rate only fractionally higher than wolves.</p>

  <p class="normal">After spending the night in jail, Abe had been charged with killing an animal listed as endangered, namely, one wolf, and of possessing the remains and transporting them. A further charge, of assaulting a police officer, was dropped. He was released by a federal magistrate, without bail.</p>

  <p class="normal">Schumacher and Lipsky, the two Fish and Wildlife special agents who had been at the meeting, had gone with a search warrant to the Harding ranch, accompanied, at his own insistence, by Hope’s increasingly uncooperative deputy sheriff. Craig Rawlinson had caused nothing but trouble by more or less siding with Harding’s sons, who had been hostile and abusive. The agents managed to keep their cool long enough to find the loaded Ruger M-77 rifle with which Abe had admitted shooting the wolf. It was duly confiscated.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wolf spent a night lying on some old pizza in Dan’s garage freezer and was shipped the next day to the Fish and Wildlife forensics lab in Ashland, Oregon, where a necropsy showed the animal’s heart and lungs had been entirely blown away. There were fragments of a 7mm magnum bullet, the bulk of which had passed on and out through the animal’s rear end and was never to be found.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Ashland scientists did DNA tests which showed the wolf had no connection with any of the wolves released in Yellowstone or Idaho. They discovered a tag in one ear that showed he had traveled from a remote part of British Columbia, more than two hundred miles away. They also discovered he was missing a toe on his right foreleg and had a scar there that suggested he had once been trapped and torn himself free. This might have affected his ability to hunt deer or elk, one of the scientists suggested, and led him to the easier option of cattle.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe at first claimed he’d shot the wolf when he found it attacking a calf in a pasture only two hundred yards from his house. He later admitted it hadn’t yet attacked, but he knew it was going to. He said there was another wolf with it at the time and he wished he’d shot that one as well. He said he was not guilty and was going to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court to prove it. He refused any legal representation on the grounds that lawyers were just wolves in suits.</p>

  <p class="normal">Meanwhile, pending ultimate endorsement from <i>Time</i> magazine, the Harding boys were doing their bit to turn their daddy into a folk hero.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had two hundred T-shirts printed with Abe’s lugubrious face on the front and SWAT (SHOOT WOLVES ALWAYS TEAM) OFFICIAL MEMBER on the back. They went on sale at The Last Resort for fifteen dollars each and sold out in two days. A second batch of five hundred had almost gone too, though the mugs - ABE HARDING, HOPE’S HERO - were shifting more slowly. Bill Rimmer had bought Dan one of each and though he hadn’t worn the T-shirt yet, Dan drank his coffee from the mug every morning.</p>

  <p class="normal">In contrast to their brethren across the state, Hope’s remaining wolves kept their heads down and for this Dan was grateful. He was damned if he was going to let Buck Calder bounce him into taking any kind of action there without proof that the wolves had done the damage. And he had enough on his plate as it was.</p>

  <p class="normal">For every phone call he got from an angry rancher, accusing him of being soft, he got one from an animal rights activist calling him a murderer, on account of the nine wolves whose death warrants he’d signed. Four separate lawsuits had been instigated, two from livestock associations, seeking an end to wolf recovery because it violated the Constitution, and two from environmental groups seeking injunctions against ‘any further illegal act of lethal control’.</p>

  <p class="normal">The day after the meeting, Wolves of the Earth had dispatched a team of activists to Hope to conduct a door-to-door survey. Dan got a series of furious phone calls. One rancher said if they knocked on his door again, he’d shoot them. He called them a ‘bunch of longhair commie terrorists’ and when Dan drove out and met the pollsters, he thought the guy had a point. He gently suggested to the group’s regional coordinator in Missoula that there was enough woe in Hope as it was and that the wolves might stand a better chance if they were allowed to keep a lower profile.</p>

  <p class="normal">The last thing Dan needed was more trouble in Hope. And, secretly, he thought Abe may have done them all a favor by killing the most likely troublemaker. It had taken some of the sting out of the ranchers’ anger over lost calves and, at the very least, had bought Helen some breathing space. With luck, she could keep tabs on the rest of the pack and avert further trouble.</p>

  <p class="normal">He hadn’t seen her since the night of the meeting and had become a little concerned about her. For three days she had neither phoned nor replied to any of the messages he left for her. He’d been on the point of driving up there when she called to say she’d had the flu but was now okay. She’d sounded a little downcast, but Dan figured she was still getting over her sickness. Calder’s son, Luke, had been taking care of her, she said, and had been really sweet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan couldn’t help feeling a twist of jealousy.</p>

  <p class="normal">What he wasn’t so sure about was the idea of Luke helping her out with trapping and tracking the wolves. After the hostility of the meeting and her mailbox being smashed, it was good that she wasn’t going to be alone up there. But the fact that the helper was Buck Calder’s son seemed somehow risky. He’d said as much to Helen on the phone the other day when she first mentioned it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Isn’t it a little like sleeping with the enemy?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m not sleeping with anyone, if you don’t mind.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Helen, I didn’t mean it literally—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He’s just helping me out. You ought to be damn grateful.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But what if he tells Calder where your traps are or—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, give me a break, Dan. That’s ridiculous.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an awkward pause. Ever since she was sick, she’d been different, either touchy or distant, whenever they spoke.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘It’s a good idea.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She didn’t reply. He imagined her sitting there, all alone, up there in the cabin, surrounded by nothing but forest and darkness.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Helen, are you okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m fine,’ she snapped back. ‘Why?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nothing. Just, you don’t sound too happy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is it obligatory? In my job description? “Temporary federal biologists will at all times be cheerful”?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Absolutely.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He thought he heard a little sniff of a laugh. There was another pause. She went on, more gently:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry, Dan. I guess I’m just feeling a little short of angels.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I worry about you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know you do. Thank you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay. Listen, I’ve found you a snowmobile.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Same place as you found my pickup?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. It’s new. Well, almost. You’re going to be needing it soon. I thought maybe I could bring it up at the weekend.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He’d told her to take care and after hanging up, sat there awhile, thinking about her, while Hope’s Hero, Abe Harding, scowled at him from his coffee mug.</p>

  <p class="normal">He would buy her dinner again, somewhere nicer this time. He hadn’t had a date with anyone since their meal at Nelly’s Diner. He had eventually summoned enough courage to ask Sally Peters out again, and again been forced to cancel. When he called the next day to apologize, she’d told him he was a sad and pathetic man and ought to get himself a life.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan had to concede it was a pretty accurate assessment.</p>

    Kathy unbuckled Buck Junior from his car seat and hoisted him onto her hip. Just along the street, Hope’s oldest inhabitant, Ned Wainwright, was being interviewed by yet another pain-in-the-ass TV crew. The town had been crawling with them for two weeks and people were getting a little tired of it, Kathy included.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">As she headed along the sidewalk toward Paragon, she could hear Ned holding forth on why the federal government liked wolves.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s plain as can be. They want ’em to wipe out all the deer and elk, so’s there won’t be nothing left for us to hunt. Then they’ll say, since there’s nothing to hunt, nobody needs guns no more and they’ll ban guns. That’s what it’s all about, getting our guns off us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Kathy had never heard anything sillier in her life, but the TV reporter was nodding as if it was gospel. As she walked by, one of the crew smiled at her. She didn’t smile back.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Haven’t you folks got anything important to cover?’ she said and, before he could answer, disappeared into the gift shop.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her mom had been going on about all the great new things Ruth had gotten in for the run-up to Christmas and, out of loyalty, Kathy had decided to buy as many presents here as possible. It was a little early to be thinking of that, but she liked to be organized. She’d chosen this morning because it was the day her mom went shopping in Helena.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ruth greeted her warmly and insisted on holding the baby while Kathy had a browse.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t all these TV people drive you nuts?’ Kathy said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Absolutely not. They buy things. Anything with a wolf on it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hadn’t thought. So at least there’s something good about it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It took her no time at all to find what she wanted. She got Clyde a fancy leather vest, a wood and brass box for her daddy to keep his cigars in and some pretty silver necklaces for her mom and Lane. She got Bob, Lane’s husband, a book on Indian art and a hatband in braided horsehair for Luke.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ruth wanted to give her a discount. Kathy wouldn’t hear of it. But she accepted the offer of a free coffee and settled at the bar with Buck Junior on her knee, while Ruth made it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the wolf stuff we’ve sold, you know, it was your mom’s idea to get it in.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Really?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Uh-huh. She’s so smart.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She sure is. Always was.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I just adore her.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They talked about Kathy’s mom for awhile and then, over their coffees, moved on to Ruth’s parents. Her father had died a long time ago, she said. Her mother remarried and now lived a frantic social life in New Jersey.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She’s the exact opposite of Eleanor,’ Ruth said. ‘Your mom always seems so calm and collected. Mine’s like a tornado. I can remember once, after some terrible row, she ran upstairs and locked herself in the bathroom and I had to go talk her out. I was, like, fifteen or something. And as I was doing it, I thought, hold on a minute, this is all wrong, I’m supposed to be the teenager around here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">When it was time to go, Buck Junior reached out to Ruth and she held him again. He seemed quite smitten and wouldn’t leave her hair alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He loves women,’ Kathy said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ruth laughed. ‘So it seems.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t you think he’s like his grandpa?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You mean . . .’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I mean, looks.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh.’ Ruth laughed. Then she frowned, assessing him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know? I’d say he’s more like your mom.’</p>

  <div class="normal1">
    Buck Calder settled himself at the end of one of the long wooden benches at the back of the auction hall and looked down over the rows of white hats toward the arena where a gaggle of Black Angus heifers had just gone for an absurdly high price and were refusing to leave.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">They were big-framed and gawky and Buck couldn’t understand why anyone in his right mind should want to buy them. There were some things in life where size surely did count, but cows weren’t one of them. All you were paying for was extra bone. It was amazing how some folk still didn’t get it. As long as an animal was big and black (the only fashionable cow color nowadays, as with everything), they automatically thought they were onto a good thing.</p>

  <p class="normal">The young rancher sitting next to him, all dressed up in his best clothes, was grinning. Buck assumed he was thinking the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank the Lord for fools,’ Buck said and saw the man’s grin vanish.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Huh?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Paying good money for bags of bone like that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I raised ’em myself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He tried to think of something to say but the man was already on his feet and pushing past to leave. What the hell, Buck thought, and looked down at the arena again.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a sandy space, about twenty feet across and surrounded by high white rails. At the moment, two young cowboys were running around it, trying to oust the reluctant heifers who stood under the spotlights like actors who’d forgotten their lines. The cowboys had long white sticks with orange flags on the end and were using them to thwack and poke the heifers. But the only evacuation it seemed to prompt was of the animals’ bowels. One of the cowboys slipped in the product of this and fell flat on his face and the audience roared its appreciation.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the little booth at the back of the arena, the auctioneer, a suave young man wearing a mustache and a scarlet shirt, leaned toward his microphone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Never say we don’t put on a good show here, folks.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck only came to the Billings auction yards three or four times a year, but he always enjoyed it. It was a long way to come, a good three and a half hour drive, and the prices you got were no better than at stockyards nearer home. But it was good to get away, check out the market and generally keep up contacts over here. The contact he most enjoyed keeping up was Luke’s former speech therapist, Lorna Drewitt.</p>

  <p class="normal">They normally had lunch and then took a motel room for a couple of hours and that was the plan today. Buck glanced at his watch. It was a little after twelve, which was fine, because the two young bulls he’d brought over in the trailer this morning were up next. They hadn’t quite been up to snuff for the annual Calder bull sale back in the spring.</p>

  <p class="normal">The heifers at last found their way out and, right on cue, in came the first of Buck’s bulls. He came charging in so fast that the poor shit-covered cowboy had to dive for cover behind one of the corrugated-iron shields that were there for precisely such occasions. The bull’s head made a resounding clang as it struck the metal. The only thing missing was steam from his nostrils. Buck felt like shouting <i>olé</i>!</p>

  <p class="normal">Forty minutes later, he was proudly towing his empty trailer out onto the highway under the big green and yellow sign that said WELCOME TO THE NORTHWEST’S LARGEST STOCKYARD. There was a man on the sign waving his hat and Buck was so pleased with himself and the price he’d got for his bulls that he almost waved back.</p>

  <p class="normal">The motel where he was meeting Lorna Drewitt was just off Interstate 90 and it only took him five minutes to get there. He tucked the truck and trailer away in a discreet corner of the parking lot, in the unlikely event of it being spotted by someone he knew, then headed into the motel.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lorna was already there, sitting pert and pretty in the lobby, reading a copy of the <i>Billings Gazette</i>. It was about six years since she moved here, after that unfortunate day when Luke had caught them in her office (though the boy was too wet behind the ears to have had any notion of what was going on). Now nearly thirty, Lorna looked sexier than ever.</p>

  <p class="normal">She saw him and got up, smiling and folding the newspaper while he walked toward her. He put his arms around her and she tilted her head back and let him kiss her neck.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘God, you smell good,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You smell of cows.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bulls, sweetheart. Purebred Calder bulls.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The motel had a restaurant that wasn’t too bad. They had steak and a bottle of Napa Valley merlot and kept touching knees and stroking each other under the table until Buck couldn’t bear it any longer. Without asking for the check, he laid a hundred-dollar bill on the table and led her off to the room for which he already had the key.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, as they lay on what remained of the bed linen, Lorna told him this was the last time she could do this. Buck hoisted himself up on one elbow and frowned at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m getting married.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What? When?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Next month.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Jesus. To what’s his name?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck, you know his name.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He did. It was Phil. They’d been going out for four years.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, why does getting married have to change things?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck, what the hell do you take me for?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck was sure there was an answer to that, but right now he couldn’t think of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">They got dressed and, in the fading light of the parking lot, kissed each other goodbye.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t call me, okay?’ she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Aw, sweetheart. At least let me call you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He drove back along the interstate, feeling more and more sorry for himself. Rain clouds the color of granite scudded low across his windshield and the trailer shuddered in the cold north wind.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everything seemed to be going wrong lately.</p>

  <p class="normal">First, Ruth going into business with Eleanor and getting all conscience-stricken about it and now Lorna doing the same. Then there were all those wackos who still kept calling him about the wolf thing. In fact, now he came to think of it, everything had been fine and dandy until those goddamn wolves showed up.</p>

  <p class="normal">Well, it was time to get serious and get rid of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first part of his plan was already in place: Luke was working for Helen Ross. And though Buck hadn’t yet managed to glean any information from the boy about where the varmints were, it was only a matter of time. When he got it, he would need someone who could act upon it.</p>

  <p class="normal">And, along with selling bulls and seeing Lorna, that was what he intended to see to today.</p>

  <p class="normal">In his scheming, he’d remembered an old trapper who, a long time ago, used to live up on the Hope River. One of those legendary fellows you never came across nowadays. Buck’s father used to hire him whenever they had varmint trouble, usually coyotes, but sometimes a mountain lion or a grizzly that was hanging around.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck recalled the guy having a son in the same line of business. But try as he might, he couldn’t remember the name.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, two nights ago, over a beer in The Last Resort, he’d casually asked old Ned Wainwright, who was ninety if he was a day, if he could remember it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lovelace. Josh Lovelace. Passed away, hell, must be twenty, thirty years ago.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There was a son too, wasn’t there?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Uh-huh. J.J. Moved down Big Timber way. Old Josh went there too when he got too old to cope. That’s where they buried him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Does the son still live there?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No idea.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Must be knocking on a little himself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’re you talking about, Buck Calder? He’s a good twenty years younger than I am. Barely out of diapers.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The old man laughed wheezily and started to cough. Buck bought him another beer then saw him safely home.</p>

  <p class="normal">He’d found a J.J. Lovelace in the phone book and had called several times. There was never a reply. So, with the address in his pocket, Buck had decided to stop by on the way back from Billings and see if he could find him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Driving in his black mood toward a black horizon, he saw the sign for Big Timber looming ahead. He indicated right and pulled off the interstate.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stopped at a gas station and asked the kid behind the counter for directions. Ten minutes later, his truck and trailer were bouncing through the potholes of a winding dirt road.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was getting dark and starting to spot with rain. After about three miles, the road passed through a grove of cottonwoods, whose last leaves whipped yellow in the wind. Beyond, his headlights found a rusty green mailbox that said ‘Lovelace’.</p>

  <p class="normal">The driveway looked too treacherous for his trailer, so he parked and, hoisting his coat collar against the rain and the wind, set off on foot.</p>

  <p class="normal">The rutted track rose steeply along one side of a coulee whose tumbling water Buck could only hear, for it was masked by a thick scrub of willow. After about half a mile he saw above him a low wooden house, set among trees on the shoulder of a hill. There was a light on inside. Parked nearby under the trees was a trailer, the kind you could live in. It was silver and had rounded ends that made it look somehow sinister, like an alien spaceship.</p>

  <p class="normal">He expected dogs to bark. But the only sound, as he climbed toward the house, was the wind and the tap of the rain on his hat.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were no drapes on the windows of the house and Buck could see the light was coming from a single bulb that hung above the kitchen table. There was no sign of life in there, nor in the trailer. He went to the kitchen door and knocked. While he waited for an answer, he turned casually around - and nearly had a heart attack.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was looking right down the barrel of a twelve-gauge shotgun.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Jesus!’</p>

  <p class="normal">The man at the other end of it was wearing a long black parka with the hood turned up. In the shadow of the hood Buck could make out a bony, graybearded face and hostile black eyes. To clear up any doubts about his identity, all he’d need to do was swap his shotgun for a scythe.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mr Lovelace?’</p>

  <p class="normal">The man didn’t admit or deny it, just let Buck hang there.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, I’m real sorry just dropping by unannounced like this, but I was worried my trailer might not make it up the driveway.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re blocking the lane down there.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Am I? I’m sorry. I’ll go move it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re not going anyplace.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mr Lovelace, my name’s Buck Calder, from Hope.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He thought of offering his hand but decided against. The mad monk might think he was grabbing for the gun.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Your daddy, Joshua, used to do some work for my daddy when I was a kid. In fact, I’m sure you and I must have met, but a long time ago.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re Henry Calder’s boy?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, sir, I am.’</p>

  <p class="normal">This seemed to make some impression. Lovelace, assuming that’s who it was, lowered the gun a little. It was now pointing at Buck’s groin.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Your daddy’s something of a legend in our parts,’ Buck said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What are you doing here?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I understand you’re in the same line of business as your father was. Or used to be.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lovelace said nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And, well . . .’ Buck glanced down at the gun. ‘Mr Lovelace, do you think maybe you might adjust your line of fire there a little?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lovelace looked at him for a moment, as if considering whether Buck was worth the price of a shotgun shell. Then he whisked the barrel in the air, clicked the safety on and strode past into the house. He left the door ajar behind him and Buck waited outside for a moment, wondering if this added up to an invitation to follow him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He decided it did.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lovelace put the gun down on the table and pushed back the hood from his head. The house was cold, so he kept his coat on. Since Winnie died he could never be bothered to light the stove in the living room. He headed through the house to his trap room at the back and heard Calder following him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The trap room was really no more than a garage but nowadays that was where he spent most of his time. He’d rigged up a little electric fire and even slept there at night, on a mattress he’d hauled in from the trailer. Not that he slept much. It was more a matter of lying there, waiting for the dawn. He knew it was crazy and that he ought to get used to using the bedroom again without Winnie, but he couldn’t bring himself to do in</p>

  <p class="normal">The bedroom, the kitchen, the whole house were empty without her and yet somehow filled with her presence. He’d tried hiding most of her things away, but it wasn’t any use. Everything, even the spaces they left, reminded him of her. It was safer to stay out here in the back room, which had always been his territory and not hers. She used to refuse to come in here, saying it smelled too awful, of trapping bait and dead animals, which he supposed it did, though he himself couldn’t smell it. He noticed that this Calder fellow could though and was trying not to look bothered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lovelace sat down on the camp stool by the fire, dragged the plastic pail with the deer head in it between his legs and got back to work. He’d been half-done skinning it out when he’d heard Calder’s truck slow and stop down in the lane. Not bad, he thought, for an old buzzard of sixty-nine, hearing that.</p>

  <p class="normal">While he got on with the deer head, Calder told him about the wolf trouble they’d been having up in Hope. There wasn’t another chair, so he’d propped his backside against the workbench that ran the length of one wall. As he talked, his eyes kept roaming the room, looking at the walls and the wooden beams of the roof, all festooned with traps and wires and snares and the skins and skulls of animals.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lovelace remembered the man’s father, Henry Calder. His own father used to call him ‘King Henry’ and joke about how high and mighty he was. Lovelace could remember helping out up at the Calder place one summer back in the early fifties, when the buffaloberries high in the forest had failed and the grizzlies were coming down, sniffing around the cows. He and his father had trapped three adults and shot four or five cubs.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had no recollection of meeting this man yacking away at him here, but then, back in the fifties, Buck Calder would only have been a kid and by that time anyhow Lovelace was mostly working away from home, in Mexico and Canada. In fifty-six he’d married Winnie and moved to Big Timber and after that he’d rarely visited Hope.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So what do you think?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Killing wolves is against the law.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Calder smiled knowingly and leaned back, folding his arms. There was something smug about him which Lovelace didn’t care for.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who’s going to know?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They’ll be watching them like hawks.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s true.’ Calder winked and grinned. ‘But you’d have inside information.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He paused for a reaction but Lovelace wasn’t going to play games. He waited to be told.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My boy’s helping this biologist woman out. He knows where the wolves are, what they’re doing, the whole deal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sounds like you don’t need no help then.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, except the boy sees things more their way than mine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So how come he’s going to part with the information?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, I’ll find some way of getting it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The deer head was almost skinned out. Lovelace put his knife down and carefully peeled the skin like a mask from the raw pink face.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I see you’re quite a taxidermist too,’ Calder said. ‘We hunt a fair bit. Do you do it for other people?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Only for friends.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t true. The only friends they’d ever had were Winnie’s. None of them had called in months. Not that he cared.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So, Mr Lovelace. What do you say?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘About what?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Will you help us out? You can name your price.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Lovelace stood up and picked up the pail. He took it over to the stainless-steel sink at the other end of the workbench and poured the blood away. He cleaned the knives while he thought it over.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was three years since he’d last done a black job, killed illegal wolves. Two years since he’d last killed legal ones, up in Alberta. After nagging him for ages to retire, Winnie had at last persuaded him. And then, just when he was getting used to it, even starting to enjoy it, six months ago, she’d gone and gotten cancer. Found her little frame was riddled with it. Within three weeks she was dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">The truth was, he now needed to keep himself busy. This was the first offer of work he’d had since the funeral. The traps hanging from the rafters were covered in rust. But he could soon fix that.</p>

  <p class="normal">He dried the knives and swilled the blood from the sink. ‘What’s that wire thing over there, with all those little bits of metal on it?’ Calder said. ‘If you don’t mind my asking.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He was pointing to the far wall, above the freezers, where Lovelace hung his drag chains and hooks and coils of steel wire.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For catching pups. My father’s idea. He called it the Loop.’</p>
