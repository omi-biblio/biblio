  <h1><b>SUMMER</b></h1>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_6">36</h2>

  <div class="normal1">
    <b>E</b>leanor sat alone in the mall café, sipping a soda and watching the holiday crowds go by. It was the Fourth of July weekend and the place was teeming. The café was on a corner by the escalators and had counters serving food of almost every ethnic kind, provided it was fast and fried. There were troughs of plastic greenery and the tables were of plain white plastic, each with its own blue and white umbrella, whose purpose (since the mall was hermetically sealed to the elements) Eleanor found puzzling. Perhaps they were to protect those eating from any missile thrown from the escalators.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">At the next table, a group of teenage girls sat trying out make-up and nail polish they’d just bought. Occasionally they would all erupt in screams of laughter or call out in chorus to someone they had spotted on the escalator. The waitress had already warned them twice to be quiet. Nearby, a young couple was feeding identical blond baby girls, who lounged happily in the most splendid double stroller Eleanor had ever seen.</p>

  <p class="normal">She looked at her watch. He was ten minutes late. Perhaps he was having trouble finding the place. He’d always hated malls, but when he’d called she hadn’t been able to think of anywhere else to meet. It was right across the street from the apartment she was renting.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prospect of seeing Buck again, after all these weeks, didn’t make her feel nervous, only sad. The last time had been at the hospital on the night of the shooting, while the surgeons were trying so hard to save Luke’s life. Eleanor hadn’t been able to look at Buck, let alone speak to him. She wasn’t going to let it be like that today.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he’d called, his voice sounded so different that she hadn’t recognized him. He’d had to say his name and she’d thought, how strange, not to know who it was, after all those years of marriage.</p>

  <p class="normal">She saw him now, at the end of the avenue of storefronts, walking alongside his reflection. He had his head slightly bowed, his face half hidden by the brim of his hat. His walk was uncertain, awkward almost, as though he didn’t belong in such a place. He was wearing a pale blue snapbutton shirt and black jeans that seemed baggy on him. As he got nearer she saw how thin he’d become.</p>

  <p class="normal">The girls at the next table had paid their check and were sweeping out of the café and one of them, who wasn’t looking, collided with Buck. He staggered back and for a moment it seemed he was going to fall. But he didn’t. The girl apologized and was whisked away by her friends. Eleanor saw them all giggling and teasing her as they went.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck stood by the entrance, adjusting his hat and scanning the faces. She had to wave to make him see her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry I’m late,’ he said as he walked up. ‘I got confused with all the different entrances.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor smiled. ‘That’s okay.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat down and the waitress arrived. He ordered a coffee and asked Eleanor what she wanted and she said she was fine with the soda. When the waitress went, they sat in silence for a few moments, neither one of them knowing what to say.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So,’ he said at last. ‘You fly tomorrow?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Monday.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Monday. Right. To London.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Via Chicago.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh. Then . . .’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’ll have a week in Ireland, then on to Paris, Rome. Then back to London for a few days, then home.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s quite a trip.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor smiled. ‘You know I always wanted to travel.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think Lane’s looking forward to it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She is. She told me. Nice for you to have some time together.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck’s coffee arrived and he stared at it and stirred it for a long time, though there was no need because he always took it black, no sugar. It gave her time to study him. He looked almost haggard. There was a patch of gray bristles on his chin that he’d missed with his razor. His shirt looked as if it hadn’t been pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lane was telling me the house you’re buying down in Bozeman is real nice.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s lovely. Small, you know. But I don’t need a big place.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You heard Ruth’s moving to Santa Fe?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah.’ He nodded. ‘Yeah, I heard that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a pause. The music playing in the mall dipped briefly for an announcement about a young boy who’d gotten himself lost. It told the parents where they could find him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know, Eleanor. That thing between Ruth and me, it was never really—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck, don’t. It’s gone.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah, but—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s all gone.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He nodded and kept his eyes on his coffee. He started stirring it again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Anyway,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How are things on the ranch?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good. Pretty good. I’ve handed a lot of stuff over to Kathy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She told me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She’s quite something, that girl. Twice the rancher Clyde’ll ever be.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He’ll learn.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Maybe.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Little Buck’s growing so fast.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck laughed. ‘Yeah! Yeah, he’s coming along good. Give him a year or two and he’ll be running the whole joint.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He took his first sip of coffee. Eleanor asked if he’d heard yet when his trial might take place.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘September, so they reckon. Kathy tell you about Clyde?’ Eleanor nodded. They’d found his fingerprints on that horrible wire loop thing. But, probably because Buck was pleading guilty to everything, charges against Clyde had just been dropped. Eleanor knew that Kathy would never forgive herself for showing him how it worked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you have any idea yet what kind of sentence you’ll get?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nine months, a year, maybe more. Tell you the truth, I don’t really care how long it is.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, Buck.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She wanted to reach across the table and take his hand. But she didn’t. She saw his face clench up as he tried to fight his tears. As if he hadn’t been punished enough, she thought.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When I think of Luke, I . . .’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck, please don’t.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. I know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He took a deep breath and held it inside him a moment, then let it come slowly, shudderingly, out. After awhile, he sniffed and looked around.</p>

  <p class="normal">He forced a laugh. ‘Anyway, Abe’s boys say it’s like summer camp in there. Apparently the old guy’s having the time of his life.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor smiled. The young couple with the twins was leaving now. She watched Buck’s face as he watched the babies being wheeled past. One of them gave him a glorious smile and it seemed to start the tears welling again in his eyes. He was so very near to the edge all the time. Eleanor sat still and let him get over it. And at last he was able to look at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All I wanted to say, was . . . I’m sorry, Eleanor. I’m so sorry.’</p>

  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    By the time they had driven high into the mountains, as far as the last road would take them, a thin band of pink had risen in the eastern sky. Hope, two hours earlier, had been like a ghost town and as they crossed the river, she had looked toward the church and thought about that day, almost a year ago, when Dan had told her about the road of wolf skulls.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">This time, he didn’t say a word and neither did Helen. And the only pair of eyes that saw them as they drove down Main Street belonged to a black cat that stopped in their dimmed lights to assess them then hurried on across the road.</p>

  <p class="normal">The van they had hired was dark green and unmarked except for the spattering of mud that their night’s efforts had given it. When they were finished, they were going to take it down to the cabin and Dan was going to use it to load it with all the things she didn’t want. By nightfall the cabin would be as empty as the day she’d moved in. The mice could have it back.</p>

  <p class="normal">The road was getting rough now and as they bumped from rut to pothole, the whole van shuddered. Helen could hear the faint rattle of the cages in the back. She hadn’t been up this high since the day Luke had shown her the wolves’ first den. She remembered the look on his dusty face when he came crawling out and what he’d said about being happy to die down there.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I figure this is about as far as we can get,’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Seems as good a place as any.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The road was being repossessed by newgrown weeds and flowers and seemed to peter out in a short plateau of rock. To the east, it fell away sharply in a narrow, rock-strewn funnel through the trees. Below, in the wakening light, Helen could see a meadow full of colorless flowers and beyond it the white flash of a creek still swollen with snowmelt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan swung the van around so that its rear was pointing to the top of the funnel. He turned off the engine and looked at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Just like the old times, huh? Prior and Ross, alpha wolf team.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She smiled. ‘What are you going to do?’ she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘With my life? I don’t know. Get a proper job, I guess. My mom always said I should “work with people” and I’d say, okay, I’ll be a mortician.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So even back then your jokes weren’t any good.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s true.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan had handed in his notice the day after Luke was shot. They’d asked him to stay on and insisted he was in no way to blame for what happened but he said he’d had enough; he was ‘wolfed out’. He agreed to stay on until they found a successor. The new guy was due to start next month.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll probably stick around these parts till Ginny’s finished high school, then move on somewhere, I guess.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They were silent for a moment. Dan peered at the sky.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s getting light. Better get this show on the road. Ready?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You bet.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They got out and walked to the back of the van. Helen held the flashlight so he could see to unlock the padlock on the rear doors. Then he pulled the handle and opened them wide.</p>

  <p class="normal">They pulled off the tarpaulins and the flashlight glinted on two aluminum cages standing side by side. They were similar to the cages that had been used to bring the Yellowstone wolves down from Canada. They were like perforated crates, about four feet long and three feet high, with a sliding door at the front. Poles to carry them with slid out at each corner.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hope someone’s told these guys what happens to wolves around these parts,’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I thought you said these were vegetarian wolves?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are. But, you know, it could be just a fad.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen wasn’t going to ask where they’d come from. Dan had made all the arrangements. All she knew was that they were an alpha pair, untagged, uncollared and untraceable. She and Dan had picked them up just before midnight at a remote spot about ten miles south of the Canadian border. There was no one to meet them. The crates had just been there waiting for them, covered with the tarps and a few branches.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen went behind the first crate and slid the handles out.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ready?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yep.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘One, two, three, lift.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They put it down at the top of the slope, then did the same with the other one. Then they took off the locks and slid up both of the front doors. Behind each was an inner door of vertical square bars through which, now, they could see two pairs of amber eyes, warily surveying them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good morning, folks,’ Dan said. ‘This is your four a.m. wake-up call.’ He looked at Helen. ‘One at a time or both together?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Together.’</p>

  <p class="normal">On the count of three, they opened the inner door and for a moment nothing happened. Then, like two Tomahawk missiles, the wolves launched themselves out of the cages. They landed in a clatter of sliprock, but didn’t fall or falter, just plunged headfirst down the slope. They were both gray, the color of the shadowed rock they ran down.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, looks like the sedative wore off,’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Halfway down the funnel, they stopped and though in the dawn it was hard to be sure, they seemed to look back up toward the van. Helen started to sob.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan walked over to her and put his arms around her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, come on now. It’s okay.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know, I know, I’m sorry.’</p>

  <p class="normal">When her tears cleared and she looked again, the wolves had vanished.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    When they pulled up outside the cabin, the sky had brightened to a perfect, cloudless blue and the sun was drying the dew from the spring flowers that still smothered the slope down to the lake. Buzz came bounding through them and because he didn’t know the van, he barked loudly until Helen climbed out and then he came wiggling and wagging toward her in apology. As they walked toward the cabin, they could smell breakfast cooking.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Luke was standing in the doorway.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was smiling and squinting in the sunshine with his one good eye. The black patch over the other still gave Helen a shock whenever she saw it. In time she was sure she would find it dashing.</p>

  <p class="normal">He saw that she’d been crying and he stepped out and came to meet them and put his arms around them both and the three of them stood huddled in silence for awhile, their heads bowed in unspoken communion, while Buzz bounced around them, wondering what was going on.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bullet had hit him in the side of the neck. It had passed right through, then hit a rock, sending a splinter of it, the size of an arrowhead, into his left eye. In the time it took for the helicopter to arrive and fly him to the hospital, he had lost a lot of blood. That he had survived was little short of a miracle.</p>

  <p class="normal">The neck wound had done little damage. They had operated on his eye for many hours and managed to save it, though Luke would never see much with it. The first thing he wanted to know, when he came around, was what had happened to the pups.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only the hooked one had died. The others had been taken to Yellowstone and successfully fostered. Luke’s father had told the police where they could find the wolfer’s trailer. And sometime later, a ranger discovered his snowmobile in a clearing above Wrong Creek. No trace of the old man himself was ever found.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke had been keen to come with Dan and Helen last night to collect and release the wolves. But Dan said it was safer, in case anything went wrong, if Luke wasn’t involved.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It went okay then?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Like a dream.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I wish we could stay to hear them howl.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Maybe one day you will,’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hope you’re both hungry.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ravenous.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They sat on the grass outside the cabin and ate eggs and bacon and hashbrowns and washed it down with coffee and fresh-squeezed orange juice. They talked about Alaska and some of the places she and Luke were going to visit in the next two months before he started college. Beyond that, they hadn’t made plans.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke wanted her to come to Minnesota with him. They would find an apartment, he said, and while he went to classes, she could do more research and finish her thesis. On weekends she could show him the wilderness.</p>

  <p class="normal">Maybe she would. There was plenty of time to decide.</p>

  <p class="normal">Curiously, for the first time in Helen’s adult life, the future didn’t seem to matter. It was as though all that had happened here had purged the part of her that had always yearned and nagged and worried. No amount of worry would alter for the better what befell them. Perhaps, as Celia had suggested in a recent letter, Helen had at last learned, along with their rookie-Buddhist father, simply to <i>be</i>. All that mattered was <i>now</i> and that she was with the person she loved best in all the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">After breakfast, Dan wouldn’t let them help clean up the cabin. They had a long journey ahead of them, he said. So together they loaded the last few things, along with Buzz, into Luke’s Jeep. Helen gave Dan the keys to her old pickup.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You see?’ he said. ‘It lasted the year.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So did I.’</p>

  <p class="normal">None of them wanted to make a big issue of saying goodbye, so they just gave each other a hug and wished each other well. Dan cracked a joke about them quitting when there was still work to be done. He stood beside the car, with the sun behind him, while Helen and Luke got in and buckled up.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Angels on your body,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yours too, Prior.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Driving down beside the river, with the cottonwoods swaying green and silver above them, they passed the derelict house where the old wolfer had once lived. There was a SOLD sign nailed to a tree by the gate.</p>

  <p class="normal">They saw no one they knew when they passed through town. They turned east and headed out toward the plains.</p>

  <p class="normal">As they came over the bridge, Helen slowed the car and stopped and they both looked one last time toward the church above the river.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look,’ Luke said.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was pointing at the sign on the other side of the road, the one that said HOPE (POPULATION 519). Three narrow beams of sunlight were shining through the bullet holes.</p>
