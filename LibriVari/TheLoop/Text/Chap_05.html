    <b>T</b>he red and white Cessna 185 banked steeply against a cobalt dome of morning sky, then seemed to hang weightless for a moment above the rim of the mountains. As he tilted the starboard wing at the sun and pointed the nose for the twentieth time toward the east, Dan looked directly down at the plane’s shadow and saw it falter then fall, like the ghost of an eagle down walls of ancient limestone a thousand feet deep.

  <p class="normal">Beside him in the narrow cockpit, Bill Rimmer sat with the radio receiver on his lap, going methodically, again and again, through the list of frequencies of every collared wolf there was from Canada to Yellowstone. There was an antenna on each wing and he constantly switched between them, while both men strained their ears for the unmistakable cluck-cluck-cluck of a signal.</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t the easiest country for spotting wolves. All morning they’d combed the peaks and the canyons, using their eyes as much as their ears, squinting into the shadowed spaces between the trees, scanning ridges and creeks and lush green meadows for some telltale sign: a carcass in a clearing, a flock of ravens, a sudden flight of deer. They saw plenty of deer, both white-tail and mule, and elk too. Once, flying low over a wide ravine, they startled a grizzly bear feeding with her cub in a patch of buffaloberries and sent them bounding for the shelter of the forest. Here and there they came across cattle, grazing the ‘allotments’, high summer pastures that many ranchers leased from the Forest Service. But of the wolf or wolves there was no trace.</p>

  <p class="normal">Last night Rimmer had driven Dan back into Hope to get his car and they’d gone into The Last Resort for a beer both felt they’d earned. The place was dark, its walls crowded with trophy heads whose unseeing eyes seemed to follow them as they took their glasses to a table in the corner. At the other end of the room a couple of ranch hands were playing pool and feeding a jukebox. The music had to compete with the ball game on the TV above the bar, where a lone drinker in a sweat-stained hat sat recounting the details of his day to the barmaid. She was trying to sound interested and overdoing it a little. Dan and Rimmer were the only other customers. Dan was still seething from his encounter with Buck Calder.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I told you he was a piece of work,’ Rimmer said, wiping the froth from his mustache.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Piece of something, anyway.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, he’s okay. Reckon his bark’s bigger than his bite. He’s one of these guys likes to test you, see how tough you are.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, that’s what he was doing.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure it was. You stood up pretty good.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, thanks Bill.’ He took a long drink from his glass and put it down with a clunk. ‘Why the hell couldn’t he wait before calling all those goddamn reporters?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They’ll all be out there again soon enough.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why’s that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He told me they’re gonna bury the dog, you know, give it a proper hero’s funeral, tombstone and all.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t believe it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s what he said.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you reckon they ought to put on the tombstone?’</p>

  <p class="normal">They both thought awhile. Dan got there first.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Maybe just, “Labrador formerly known as Prince.”’ They laughed like a couple of kids and far longer than such a dubious joke deserved, but it felt good and that and the beer soon put Dan in a better mood. They had another and stayed until the ball game finished. By then the place was getting busier. It was time to go.</p>

  <p class="normal">As they headed for the door, Dan heard a voice on the TV say, ‘And in the Hope Valley, a baby’s narrow escape from death when Mr Wolf comes to call. That story coming up. Stay with us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">So they did, but stood in the shadows by the door in case they were spotted. And true to his word, after the commercials, the local anchorman came back with the story and Dan felt his hackles rise at the sight of Buck Calder’s crocodile smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The wolf’s a killing machine. He’ll take anything he can.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The guy ought to run for president,’ Dan said in a low voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, over a shot of Dan and Rimmer, trying to keep a low profile at the back of the crowd, just as they were doing now, the report went on to say that federal officials were ‘embarrassed’ by what had happened. They used a snippet of the short interview Dan had given, in which he proved the point before he even opened his mouth. He was squinting furtively into the glare of the lights, like a man on trial for unspeakable crimes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Could this wolf be one of those wolves you released into Yellowstone?’ the reporter in the red suit asked him, shoving the microphone up his nose. The <i>you</i> hurt.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s really too early to know that. Until we’ve had a chance to examine the body, we can’t even confirm it <i>was</i> a wolf.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you saying you don’t think it was?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, I’m not saying that. I’m just saying we can’t confirm it yet.’ His attempt at a disarming smile just made him look shiftier. Dan had seen enough.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s get out of here,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Flying over from Helena this morning, with the sun bouncing off the mountain front, things hadn’t seemed quite so bleak. He and Rimmer had talked optimistically about the chances of picking up a signal. Maybe, in her panic, Kathy Hicks hadn’t registered that the wolf was wearing a radio collar. And even if he wasn’t, maybe he was teamed up with others who maybe were. That was a whole bagful of maybes. In his heart, Dan knew the chances weren’t great.</p>

  <p class="normal">As a matter of policy, over the past couple of years, they had deliberately scaled down the number of wolves they’d collared. The idea of restoring a viable breeding population to the region was that the animals should be truly wild and live as naturally as possible. When there were enough breeding pairs, they could be taken off the list of endangered species. It was Dan’s personal view that collars weren’t necessarily going to help this happen.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a view not shared by everyone. There were even those who advocated using capture collars, fitted with darts you could trigger anytime you wanted to put the wolf to sleep. Dan had used them himself a few times when he worked in Minnesota and they sure did make life easier. But every time you captured a wolf and drugged him and handled him and took a blood sample and tagged his ear and gave him a shot, you made him a little less wild, a little less of a wolf. And in the end you had to ask yourself whether this kind of remote control by humans made him that much different from a toy boat on a park pond.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, if a wolf started getting himself into trouble, killing cattle or sheep or people’s pets, you needed to get a collar on him pretty damn quick - for his own sake as much as everyone else’s. You tried to give ranchers the impression that you knew the address of every wolf in the state and then, when one stepped out of line, you had to scramble like hell to find him before someone beat you to it with a gun. If you could get a collar on him, at least then you knew where he was. And if he got into trouble again, you could relocate or shoot him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, as the sun climbed higher in the sky, the two men in the Cessna’s cramped cockpit were as silent as Rimmer’s receiver. If any wolf down there was wearing a collar, they should have found him by now. Finding an uncollared wolf - or wolves - in country like this was a much tougher job. The question was, who was going to do it? And then, who was going to monitor them once they had been found?</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a job Dan would happily have done himself. The only wolf he ever got to see nowadays was Fred. He’d become so much of a desk biologist, he often joked about doing a PhD on the breeding habits of memos. He longed to be out in the field again, like the good old days in Minnesota, where the phone and the fax couldn’t get you. But it was out of the question. He had too much to do and no one except Donna to off-load it on. Bill Rimmer had generously volunteered to help with any trapping, but in truth he was more overworked than anyone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wolf recovery had long been a political football but lately all the goals seemed to have been scored by those politicians who opposed it. As the wolf population grew, so did the controversy surrounding it. The more incidents like this there were, the harder it became to argue for more tax dollars and manpower to handle them. Dan had seen his budgets cut to the bone. Now even the bones were going. Sometimes, in an emergency, he managed to shuffle someone from another job for a month or two or borrow a research student or one of the volunteers they used down in Yellowstone.</p>

  <p class="normal">The trouble was, this was more than just a trap-and-collar job. Hope could easily turn out to be the most severe test yet for the whole recovery program.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the town’s deep hatred of the wolf and the fact that the media were already making a meal of it, whoever Dan sent in wouldn’t simply have to be good at trapping and tracking wolves. He, or she, would have to be a skilled communicator, sensitive to local feelings yet strong enough to stand up to bullies like Buck Calder. Biologists with such an array of talent were hard to find.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Cessna reached the end of another eastward run and Dan turned it once more and, as it tilted, looked down to see the town of Hope laid out like a surveyor’s model. An eighteen-wheeler cattle truck that looked small enough to pluck with your fingers was pulling out of the gas station. The bends of the river flashed like chrome between the cottonwoods.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan glanced down at the fuel gauge. There was just enough juice for one more pass, then they’d call it a day.</p>

  <p class="normal">This time he flew directly over the Calder ranch where a few cattle stood out like black ants on the sunbleached grass. A car was winding its way through the hills toward the Hicks place. Another damn reporter, no doubt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once they reached the forest, he flew lower, as low as he dared, the tree and canyon tops skidding away crazily beneath the plane’s shadow. Then, just as he was lifting the nose for the final climb, he caught a glimpse of something up ahead, a pale gray form slipping out of sight over a rocky ridge. His heart leapt and he looked at Rimmer and knew he’d seen it too.</p>

  <p class="normal">Neither one of them spoke and the ten seconds it took to reach the place seemed much longer. Dan swung the plane out to one side and dipped the inside wing as they crested the ridge and they both peered down its far side where the animal had gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I got him,’ Rimmer said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Just going into the trees by that long slab of rock.’ He paused. ‘It’s a coyote. Real big fella though.’ He turned to Dan and gave him a consoling grin. Dan shrugged.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Time we were headed home.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yep. Looks like a job for the trap man.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan put the Cessna into a final turn and the sun dazzled briefly through the windshield. Then he leveled the wings and set course for Helena.</p>

  <p class="normal">And somewhere below, in a wild place that was still a young man’s secret, the wolves heard the drone of the plane’s engine fade and die.</p>
