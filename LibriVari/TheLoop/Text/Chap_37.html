  <div class="normal1">
    <b>T</b>he white wolf paused in the mouth of the den while the two biggest and bravest of her pups tottered between her legs and out into the moonlit world.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">The excavated earth around the den was packed solid as cement from the pacing of the two yearlings and was strewn with scat and bone shards. One of the pups tried his new teeth out on a piece but then dropped it, unimpressed. There was something near at hand that smelled better.</p>

  <p class="normal">The mother had smelled it too, all day. Perhaps she thought it was something the yearlings had brought, though they hadn’t been back since the humans came the previous night. Perhaps the humans had left it there. She had caught their scent long before she heard their voices and she’d lain still and listened to the scuffle and tramp of their feet outside the den. She’d heard the clink of something too and could still smell it out there, mixed with the waft of fresh meat. It had the same harsh, unnatural tang as the thing that had once snapped shut on her paw.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a scent unknown to the two pups however. All they smelled was the meat. All day they had tried to leave the den and time and again she had stopped them and carried them back. But after so many hours of waiting in vain for the yearlings to bring food, and with six greedy mouths tugging at her teats, she was starving and at last relented.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first of the pups staggered with great purpose toward the smell and his mother followed, nudging the other pup before her to his first proper meal. Behind her, two other pups stood in the mouth of the den, blinking at the moon.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a lump of pale meat and now she could smell and see others, the same, a few yards to either side. The tang she had smelled came from a line, a thing of humans, that ran between them. She hesitated, sniffed the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">By now the pup was sniffing the meat. He nudged it with his nose and nipped it, pulling it along the ground. As he tugged, his mother saw the line move and she shied, as she might at a rattlesnake. There was danger here, she now knew. And it was no snake. In a bound she was beside the pup.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the meat was already inside his mouth and he bit on it.</p>

    Luke waved as he forked down off the road and Helen, behind him, flashed her lights and kept on toward the clearcut. He left the car in its usual hiding place, took the bags and the jabstick and headed off at a run through the trees.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">The going was tricky. He kept the beam of the flashlight low and ran in the pool it made. There were rocks and roots and tangles of blowdown and several times he caught a foot and fell headlong in the bushes.</p>

  <p class="normal">He tried to work out how much time he had.</p>

  <p class="normal">If they set out from The Last Resort, they would be coming from the north. They would use the road that ran from town due west alongside the Townsend property all the way to the forest, then turn left onto the logging road. But without knowing when they had left, it was pointless trying to calculate. All he knew was that he had to keep running.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last, through the trees ahead of him, he saw the moonlit glow of the clearcut. He turned off the flashlight and fished in his pocket for Dan’s nightscope, while he walked to the forest’s edge. He stopped there and switched it on and just as he found focus, the wolf started to bark.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was the alpha female. She was a few yards from the entrance to the den and barking right at him. There was a movement behind her and it took Luke a moment to realize it was the pups. They were scurrying down into the den. They were much darker than their mother and he couldn’t count how many there were. The mother was shepherding them in, but she didn’t seem to want to follow them.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the last one had gone, she started pacing to and fro, all the while looking toward Luke and barking. Every now and again, she kept going back to the same place and lowering her nose to sniff something. Then she would lift her head and bark and now she ended each burst of barking with a howl. Luke willed her to shut up. She was telling the whole world where she was.</p>

  <p class="normal">He put the nightscope away and stepped into the clearcut. The wolf was about fifty yards away and as he got closer, she seemed to grow less sure of herself. She kept running off a few yards, lowering her tail, and then seemed to get her courage back and turned and came back, barking and howling at him. In the moonlight, Luke could see something dark in the place that she kept returning to. And now, in a pause of her barking, he heard a whine and a whimper that he knew didn’t come from her.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he walked the last few yards to the den, the mother ran off. She stopped about twenty yards away and stood watching him. She was suddenly silent. There was another whimper. He switched on the flashlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh God,’ he murmured.</p>

    Helen had parked the pickup across the road and hidden the keys under a rock nearby. On its own, it wasn’t much of a roadblock, but the tall Douglas fir she’d cut down in front of it with the chain saw made it better. Now she was cutting a second and the chips were showering into the beam of Eleanor’s flashlight.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">In a minute she was through and she stood back and yelled for Eleanor to do the same. The tree leaned and creaked and toppled exactly where she wanted it and the forest repaired its bruised silence around them.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were a mile and a half north of the clearcut. Helen had chosen the place for its view of the road that wound up from the valley below in a series of steep bends. Any approaching headlights would be seen a long way off. So far there were none.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen put the chain saw in the bed of the pickup. Eleanor handed her the flashlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mind if I switch it off and save the batteries?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. I like the dark.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She seemed perfectly calm and Helen wondered how she managed it. Her own heart was on a rollercoaster. The two women stood in silence for awhile beside the pickup, staring at the moon. Somewhere far above them in the forest, an owl was calling.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you warm enough?’ Helen asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m fine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’d give anything for a cigarette.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I used to love to smoke.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, they say only the best kind of women smoke . . .’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the worst kind of men.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So if we quit, does that disqualify us?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Absolutely not.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They both laughed and then fell silent again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Maybe they’re not coming,’ Helen said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, they’ll come.’ She frowned. ‘What is it, do you think, about these animals, that makes people hate them so much?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘About wolves? I don’t know. Maybe they’re too much like us. We look at them and see ourselves. Loving, caring, social creatures who also happen to be terrific killers.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor considered this awhile.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Maybe it’s envy too.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Of what?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That they’re still part of nature and we’ve forgotten how to be.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She seemed about to go on, when something down in the valley caught her eye.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here they come,’ she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">A pair of headlights was coming around the first bend. Helen’s heart climbed back on the rollercoaster The women stood watching while another vehicle, then another came into view. And now they could hear their engines and dogs barking. There were more trucks coming now. Five, six . . . eight in all, winding up the road in convoy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, here we go,’ said Helen.</p>

  <div class="normal1">
    Buck hadn’t counted but he figured there were about twenty of them, including a good few he’d rather not have had along. The two Harding boys and the loggers they’d been drinking with in the bar were pretty far gone. Some had brought liquor along and he’d had to stop on the way up and tell them to quit whooping and singing or they could turn around and go home. On the other hand, there was safety in numbers. No one was going to put the whole damn town in jail.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">He and Clyde were leading in Clyde’s truck, with one of the loggers sitting wedged between them to make sure they didn’t get lost. He was one of the guys who’d come up here with Clyde last night to lay that damn fool loop thing. They should have just stuffed some poison down the hole or poured gasoline in it or something. Anyhow, they’d put that right when they got there now.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck’s anger had refined itself. Shooting those two wolves, he was so fired up he’d hardly known what he was doing. It was like something bursting into flames in his head, an explosion of all the pressure that had been building inside him, months of being slighted, rejected and thwarted. But now the smoke had cleared and his anger glowed white-hot within him like a branding iron, searing and still.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, look,’ Clyde said. He was peering up ahead. ‘There’s somebody already got here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They were coming around the last bend and the road was leveling out. A couple of hundred yards ahead of them, there was someone with a flashlight. Then, in the headlights, they saw trees had been felled across the road and a truck parked behind them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What the . . .?’ Clyde said. ‘It’s the wolf woman. Who the hell’s that with her?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck had already seen who it was. And now Clyde recognized her too. He looked at Buck.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s Eleanor doing here, for Christsakes?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck didn’t answer. She must have gone and told Helen Ross what was happening. His own damned wife.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Stop here,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">They stopped about fifteen yards short of the roadblock and as they did, Helen Ross stepped over the trees and came toward them, shielding her eyes against Clyde’s headlights. Buck got out and walked slowly around to the front of the car. He stood with his back to the hood, waiting for her. All the other men were piling out of their trucks and coming up behind him to see what was going on. Abe Harding’s dogs were barking their heads off.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hello, Mr Calder.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He just stared at her. He could tell the little bitch was scared.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m afraid, sir, this road has been closed.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Uh-huh? On whose authority?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The US Fish and Wildlife Service.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is a public road.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know that, sir.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor was coming up behind her now. No doubt thinking she could make a monkey of him in front of everyone. He didn’t look at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Craig?’ he called out, keeping his eyes on Helen Ross. ‘Is Craig there?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah!’ Craig Rawlinson pushed his way through the crowd.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck?’ Eleanor said. He ignored her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sheriff Rawlinson. Does this woman have the authority to close a public road?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not unless she’s got a piece of paper to prove it, she hasn’t.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck,’ Eleanor said again. ‘Please. It’s time to stop.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Stop?’ He laughed. ‘Honey, I haven’t even gotten started.’ The Ross woman turned to Craig Rawlinson.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I can’t believe you’re going to help these men commit a crime.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re the only one who’s committing a crime around here, far as I can see. You’re obstructing a public highway.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Ross pointed at Buck. ‘This man has just shot two wolves . . .’ Everyone laughed ‘. . . You should be arresting him, not helping him kill more.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. Now turn around and get your truck out the way or I’ll arrest you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached out to take her by the shoulder, but she lashed out and gave him a shove in the chest that made him stagger back. One of the loggers cheered sarcastically.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Feisty little thing, ain’t she?’ Wes Harding called out.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everyone laughed again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why don’t you all just grow up?’ Helen shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor stepped forward and put a hand on her shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s the matter with all you boys?’ Eleanor said. ‘I’ve known some of you since you were kids. I know your mothers. I think you’d all be better just going home.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The sound of her voice, the calm reasoning tone, made Buck’s blood seethe.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Will someone shut those damn dogs up? Clyde?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yessir?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get those fucking trees off the road.’</p>

    Luke had tried for ten minutes to get the hooks out of the pup’s mouth, but all three barbs were deeply bedded in and he couldn’t loosen them without doing more damage. He managed to get all the meat out of the poor little thing’s throat so it didn’t choke, but that was all. In the end, he knew it was going to bleed to death and if he wasted anymore time, maybe all the others would be lost as well, so he put it back on the ground where he’d found it, attached to the line like a drowning fish.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">All the while, the mother wolf had been barking and howling at him from across the clearcut, pacing up and down, thinking no doubt that he was murdering her pup. He could even hear her now that he was down in the den.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was inching along the tunnel on his belly, pointing the flashlight ahead of him. It was narrower than the one he and Helen had gone down last summer and it seemed longer too, with bends where the digger had come up against rock. There was a faint smell of ammonia and the farther he went, the stronger it got. He guessed it was from the pee of the pups and that he must now be getting near to the nesting chamber.</p>

  <p class="normal">He held the jabstick out in front of him, in the beam of the flashlight, just in case the mother came in through the other entrance below the rocks. He had no idea how many pups he would find. Helen said there could sometimes be as many as nine or ten.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then suddenly he heard them whining and a moment later, as he slithered around the final bend, he saw them in the beam of the flashlight. They were in a dark furry huddle at the far corner of the chamber, squinting and mewing at the light. He couldn’t tell how many there were. Five or six at most.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, there,’ he said softly. ‘It’s okay. Everyone’s going to be okay.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He put down the jabstick and the flashlight and pulled out the canvas bag that he’d stuffed down the front of his shirt. He opened it up and elbowed his way toward the pups. There were five of them and he wondered if he could take them all in one go. But the tunnel was narrow and he didn’t want to risk hurting any of them. He decided to take three first, then come back for the other two.</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached out and plucked up the first one. Its fur was soft and all fluffed up. It mewed at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know, I know. I’m sorry.’</p>

  <div class="normal1">
    ‘Move your truck,’ Buck Calder said.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’&gt;</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen stood facing him, with her arms folded, trying to look tough and official. Her head came about halfway up his chest. She could feel her knees going wobbly. She had her back to the driver’s door and was wishing she’d locked it before hiding the key. She’d lost all track of time. All she knew was that Luke would need longer than he’d had to get the pups out.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor had given up on her husband and was now trying to make her son-in-law see reason while he supervised the removal of the second tree. The first had already been towed off the road by the Harding boys. Hicks stood there, shaking his head, not looking at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey bitch!’ someone yelled. ‘Move your fucking truck!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen glanced at him and saw it was her bearded friend from outside the courthouse. He and some of his buddies had guns out now and others had broken off branches and were busy wrapping rags around them and dowsing them with kerosene.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey! That’s great, guys,’ Helen said. ‘Are we going to set a cross on fire too?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You offering to be on it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Craig!’ Buck called. ‘Does this truck constitute an obstruction? ’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It certainly does.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck turned back to her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you going to move it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’&gt;</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked over her shoulder into the pickup.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Give me the keys.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He held out his hand and Helen only just resisted the urge to spit in it. Over his shoulder she could see Eleanor talking to Abe Harding, telling him he was already in enough trouble as it was and would end up going to jail for a long time. He wasn’t listening. The second tree was being dragged away behind his sons’ truck, in the back of which the two dogs were tethered, still hollering.</p>

  <p class="normal">The torches were being lit.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck Calder tried to reach around her for the door handle, but Helen moved back to block him. She suddenly remembered the last time he’d had her backed up against her truck and he seemed to remember it too, for he edged away a little, out of range of her knee.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Clyde? Get a rope on this thing.’ He walked away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘On her or the pickup?’ Ethan Harding called out.</p>

  <p class="normal">They all laughed. Someone handed Hicks a rope and he started to walk toward the pickup. Helen turned and wrenched open the door. She reached behind the seat and pulled out Luke’s rifle.</p>

  <p class="normal">She pointed it at Hicks and cocked it. He stopped in his tracks and everything went quiet. Buck Calder had his back to her and, slowly now, he turned and saw the gun. Helen swallowed hard.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Go home. All of you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Everyone stood frozen, staring at her. For the first time, Eleanor looked frightened. Calder was frowning at the gun and as he stepped toward her she swung the barrel so it was pointing at him instead. He faltered. But he kept on coming.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where did you get that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen didn’t answer. She was breathing too fast and knew her voice would show, if it wasn’t already obvious, how scared she was. He walked right up to her, until the barrel was an inch from his heart.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You dare,’ he whispered. ‘You <i>dare</i> point my own dead son’s gun at me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">And he closed his hand over the barrel and took it from her.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    The mother wolf was right at the mouth of the den when he came out with the first bagload of pups and he thought for a moment that she was going to attack him. She backed away, barking and snarling at him, showing her teeth and gums. Luke yelled and swung the jabstick at her and only then did she run off.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">But she was still only twenty yards or so away, still barking and Luke worried that if he left the first bag of pups outside the den she might come and carry it off while he was down getting the others. Maybe, to be safe, he should take the first lot to the Jeep. But he probably didn’t have time and anyway, she might nip into the den while he was gone and make off with the others.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wedged the whimpering bag of pups into a crevice between the rocks and then hunted around for smaller rocks to stack in front of it. It wouldn’t stop her getting at them, but it might buy him enough time. All the while he was doing this, he tried to block his ears to the screams of the pup who was hooked to the wire which, he now discovered, stretched in a wide circle all around the den.</p>

  <p class="normal">What kind of mind, he wondered, could ever have devised such a thing?</p>

  <p class="normal">In the end, he couldn’t bear the screaming any longer. And although he knew he shouldn’t waste precious time, he had to have another go at getting the hook out of the pup’s mouth, while its mother ran around him in demented circles. But still he couldn’t get it out.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the mother stopped hollering and Luke heard another sound. A first distant rumble of engines and a dog barking. And looking up the clearcut, he saw headlights pan the sky.</p>

  <p class="normal">He put the pup down, grabbed the flashlight and the empty bag and dived back down into the den.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    The cars and trucks all pulled up in a line along the top of the clearcut and everyone climbed out. Most of them had guns and those who didn’t were holding flashlights or flaming torches. Abe had his dogs on leashes now. They were barking more crazily than ever.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Buck stood by Clyde’s truck with Henry’s gun in his hands. His blood was still simmering at the sight of that little whore-bitch pointing it at him. He felt like smashing her cute little bunny-hugger face in. It was just as well Craig Rawlinson had been there to take her aside while they shunted her shit-heap of a truck off the road. He’d felt pretty much the same about Eleanor, siding up with the bitch against her own husband like that. It was unbelievable.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tactfully, Rawlinson had said he’d stay down there with the two of them. Buck knew he’d then be able to plead ignorance about what they were all about to do.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So, where is it?’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Clyde pointed down the clearcut.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Plumb in the middle there. Couple of hundred yards down. See the rocks?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Uh-huh.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Den’s right under there.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look!’ Wes Harding yelled. ‘There’s one right there!’</p>

  <p class="normal">He was pointing toward the edge of the clearcut. Every flashlight they had was at once pointed the same way. Few of the beams could reach that far, but enough could for them to see a white wolf, brazen as day, standing there staring right back at them. And as they looked, she had the nerve to start howling at them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck was just lifting his rifle when three or four others beat him to it and a volley of shots rang out.</p>

  <p class="normal">How many hit her, it was impossible to tell, but it was enough to lift her clean off her feet. She was dead before she landed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Listen up!’ Buck called out. ‘I’ve got a job to finish here. I’ve killed me two of these critters today and if anyone’s going to jail it’s me, okay? If another one shows, it’s mine. You all understand?’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was mumbled agreement.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Abe and me are going to be cellmates. Ain’t that right, Abe?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe didn’t smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay. Got the shovels and the gasoline?’</p>

  <p class="normal">The loggers called out to confirm that they had.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then let’s go.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t as easy a walk as it looked. There were felled trees that they had to climb across and stumps and root holes to snag their feet. Buck let Clyde lead the way with the flashlight. He kept the safety catch of Henry’s rifle off and his eyes locked on the den. He wasn’t going to have one of these drunken jerks beating him again if another wolf showed its face.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were about halfway down the clearcut now and he could see the black hole of the den showing clearly in the pale moonlit earth. Suddenly he saw its shape alter. It was another wolf. He didn’t want to yell because he knew, despite what he’d told them, all the others would take a shot.</p>

  <p class="normal">Instead, he whispered to Clyde to stop.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There’s one coming out. When I tell you, shine your light.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He raised his gun and centered the crosshairs on the moving shape emerging from the mouth of the den.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Now!’</p>

  <p class="normal">At exactly the same moment that the flashlight beam found its mark, Buck pulled the trigger and the shot rang out.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a cry. Sharp and terrible.</p>

  <p class="normal">And Buck and all who heard it knew that it wasn’t from a wolf.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    ‘Luke? Luke?’
  </div>

  <p class="normal">It was the moon calling him and he couldn’t understand why or what it might want. And he couldn’t understand why it kept getting lost in a whirl of red clouds and then suddenly bobbing out again. Except they were more liquid than clouds and closer too, almost as if they were actually in his eyes. And now he found he was in control of them, because when his eyes filled up and the moon went red, all he had to do was blink and everything would clear and there was the moon, all clean again, calling him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Luke? Oh God. Luke?’</p>

  <p class="normal">It sounded like his father, but it couldn’t be, because his father didn’t want anything to do with him anymore. And there were other voices, voices he didn’t recognize, and sometimes their shadows loomed across the moon and he wished they would get out of the way and leave him alone so he could watch it.</p>

  <p class="normal">He thought of telling them, because he knew he had a voice. Helen had found it for him. But he didn’t know where it was at the moment. Perhaps she’d borrowed it. There was a kind of cold space in his throat where it normally was, like a hollow in a snowdrift. It was the only thing he could feel. Except that when he blinked, one of his eyes felt funny and he wasn’t sure he was looking through it anymore. It seemed to have something wet and lumpy in it that even the blinking couldn’t clear.</p>

  <p class="normal"><i>Thwuck-thwuck-thwuck</i>.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now there was another moon coming across the sky. Or maybe it was a star or a comet. But it was lower than that and really, really bright. Blindingly bright. It hurt his eye. And he could hear it too now, getting louder and louder and louder.</p>

  <p class="normal"><i>Thwuck-thwuck-thwuck-thwuck</i>.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then both it and the moon flooded with red clouds again.</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t clouds. It was curtains, red curtains, closing across the sky. And this time he couldn’t blink them open. Someone was trying to do it for him, but they just kept on closing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Crimson curtains.</p>

  <p class="normal"><i>Thwuck-thwuck-thwuck-thwuck-thwuck</i>.</p>

  <p class="normal">Where was she?</p>

  <p class="normal">He wanted her to bring him his voice so he could talk with her and touch her and feel more than just this cold hollow in his throat. There were so many people now. And there seemed to be some new ones too and they were sticking things into him and putting some kind of mask thing over his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">But where was Helen?</p>

  <p class="normal">Just for an instant, he thought he heard her voice, among all the others, calling his name. But they were lifting him up now and away and the red curtains had closed for the last time. Maybe when they opened again she would be standing there. Maybe he’d be there too, beside her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two stone statues, hand in hand.</p>
