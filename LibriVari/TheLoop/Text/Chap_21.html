  <div class="normal1">
    <b>T</b>he meeting wasn’t due to start for another half-hour, but already there was a steady procession of trucks coming into town. It was getting dark and most had their headlights on. Some pulled up outside Nelly’s Diner but the more popular destination was The Last Resort, which didn’t bode well for the meeting. A mud-spattered pickup was stopping there now and Helen watched two men in hats and cowboy boots get out and head into the bar. One of them said something and the other laughed, turning his coat collar up against the wind. It was starting to rain.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">She was spying from the window of Ruth Michaels’ gift shop, sipping her third double espresso, which was a bad idea because she was nervous enough as it was. All she really wanted was a cigarette. Ruth had put some soothing music on, but it only served to heighten Helen’s foreboding of the storm to come.</p>

  <p class="normal">Stuck to the glass of the door was one of the yellow posters that were all over town.</p>

  <div class="atx1">
    <div class="ctag1">
      WOLF KILLS! <br/>

      PUBLIC MEETING <br/>

      HOPE COMMUNITY HALL <br/>

      THURSDAY 7PM
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="normal">It was two days since Buck Calder and his neighbors had gathered their herds and feelings were still running high. Helen had spent almost every waking moment trying to restore calm. She’d visited every rancher who claimed to have lost calves - and gotten short shrift from all of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan had hoped these one-on-one visits would help avoid a public meeting that could get hijacked by a few trouble-makers. But Buck Calder had bounced them into it. He’d announced the meeting two nights ago on TV, saying ‘those federal government fellas who let all these wolves loose in the first place’ might care to come along and explain themselves to the people who paid their wages.</p>

  <p class="normal">The TV people were already down at the hall, setting up their lights. Dan had groaned when he saw them because it was the same woman reporter who had drooled over Buck Calder when the dog got killed. That aside, Dan - and Bill Rimmer - seemed remarkably cool. They were both sitting at the little bar at the back of the shop, chatting with Ruth as though they didn’t have a care in the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">As she walked back to join them, Rimmer gave her a grin.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Helen, you know the one about the horse who walks into a bar and the barman says—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘“Hey, why the long face?” Yeah, I know that one. You’re saying I look like a horse?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, just like you’re going to a funeral.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah, right. My own.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, Helen,’ Dan said. ‘It’ll be fine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thanks, Prior. I might find that a little more reassuring if you hadn’t told me what happened last time they had a wolf meeting here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That was before my time,’ Ruth said. ‘What did happen?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, just guys with guns and buckets of blood being poured over cars,’ Helen said. ‘Nothing much.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That was years ago,’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah, before they had wolves. Ruth, do you mind if I have a cigarette?’ She saw Dan’s surprise. ‘So I smoke, okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Go ahead,’ Ruth said.</p>

  <p class="normal">They spent the next fifteen minutes rehearsing what Helen was going to say. She’d tried to get Dan to front the meeting, but he insisted it was her show. The audience wasn’t going to be wholly hostile. According to the radio news, a militant environmentalist group called Wolves of the Earth (or WOE, as they preferred) was planning to show up as well.</p>

  <p class="normal">In case things got out of hand, Dan had taken precautions. Hope had a resident deputy sheriff, a young man called Craig Rawlinson, whom Helen had met a couple of times. There was no mistaking him for a wolf lover. He was the son of a rancher and married to the daughter of another who was among those claiming to have lost calves. So Dan had asked for extra police to stand discreetly by, along with a couple of plainclothes special agents from the Fish and Wildlife Service who were already at work over in The Last Resort, keeping an eye on potential rabble-rousers. He’d also set up a sign outside the community hall that said, PUBLIC MEETING. NO ALCOHOL. NO SIGNS. NO WEAPONS. Someone had already added NO WOLVES.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were voices now, outside in the street, as people made their way down toward the hall. Helen’s nerves were jangling with caffeine and nicotine. Dan stood up and paid for the coffees.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I guess we’d better be getting down there.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He put an arm around Helen’s shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I want you to know, anyone pulls a gun, I’m right behind you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thanks, Dan. I’ll remember to duck.’</p>

  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    An hour later, Dan’s joke about guns seemed even less amusing.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Helen had been on her feet for about twenty minutes, trying to make a speech that should have taken ten. The heckling was starting to get to her.</p>

  <p class="normal">The place was packed. There was seating for about a hundred, but easily as many again were standing at the back, which was where most of the heckling was coming from. Beyond the dazzle of the TV lights, Helen could see the hall doors had been left open and there were even people standing outside in the rain. Despite this ventilation, the heat was already unbearable because all the hall radiators were on and no one seemed able to turn them off. As tempers and temperature rose, many had shed their coats or were fanning themselves with the leaflets that had been handed to them when they arrived.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen was standing at one end of a long trestle table that had been placed on the rostrum at the front of the hall. Dan and Bill Rimmer sat huddled beside her like war criminals. At the other end, leaning back in his chair and regally surveying the crowd, sat Buck Calder. He was in his element.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beneath the brim of his hat, there was the gleam of sweat. There were damp patches under the arms of his otherwise spotless pink shirt. He seemed literally aglow. His opening speech had been masterful. For the benefit of those few who hadn’t heard it a dozen times, he began by recounting how his baby grandson had been snatched from the jaws of certain death. Then, like a suave prosecuting attorney, he went on to catalog the terrible losses he and his neighbors had since sustained. The only surprise was that it was he who first got heckled.</p>

  <p class="normal">It had started toward the end of his speech and came from a small group of latecomers at the back that Helen hadn’t noticed till then. If she had, she would have known whose side they were on from the number of beards and Patagonia jackets among them. They had to be the WOE people. There were about half a dozen of them and at first Helen had felt heartened by their presence - until she saw how their heckling only served to inflame others.</p>

  <p class="normal">Calder had handled the hecklers well. One of them, a woman with steel-rimmed glasses and a blue fleece just like Helen’s, had called out:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wolves have more right to be here than your cows! I say, get rid of the cows!’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a rumble of anger and Buck stood calmly smiling while it faded, then said: ‘I see we’ve got some of those city folk here tonight.’ The audience roared their approval.</p>

  <p class="normal">He’d kept the gag going when the time came to introduce Helen.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Miss Ross comes from the windy city of Chicago, if I remember rightly?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen had smiled grimly. ‘Yes. For my sins, I do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, sweetheart, feel free to repent those sins here tonight.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Taking their cue from the pro-wolf people who’d started it, another group at the back had been heckling her ever since. Among the loudest were Helen’s favorite loggers and Wes and Ethan Harding. Abe Harding, thank goodness, didn’t seem to be there.</p>

  <p class="normal">Neither did Luke.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen had looked in vain for his face in the crowd before the meeting got going. She hadn’t seen him since the day they caught the wolf. He hadn’t come to the cabin or been around when she’d visited the ranch to be harangued by his father about the missing calves. She’d worried about him and been surprised by how much she missed his company.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was getting toward the end of her speech now and hoped she reached it before the end of her tether. She’d gone through what was known so far about the wolves, which wasn’t much, except that there were nine of them and that early DNA tests on the samples she’d taken showed no relation to any of the wolves released in Yellowstone or Idaho. Then she’d said a few words about the Defenders of Wildlife scheme that compensated ranchers for any verified wolf-kill. When she’d finished, they were going to take questions.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So, just to recap, we’ve got two of these wolves collared now and we’re going to be keeping real close tabs on them. Any proven killers of livestock will be removed or destroyed. That’s absolutely clear.’ She glanced at Dan, who nodded. ‘I understand how strongly some of you are feeling right now. All we’d ask is that you give it a little time and—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What more proof do you need? Wolves kill cattle, period.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, sir, with respect, there’s a fair amount of evidence, both from my own research in Minnesota and here in Montana too, in the Ninemile Valley, north of Missoula, that wolves <i>can</i> live in close proximity with livestock and not bother them—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, even the goddamn wolves are liberals in Missoula!’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a roar of laughter and Helen waited for it to pass, trying to keep her smile in place. It felt more like a grimace.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, maybe. But a biologist there did some pretty interesting research. He fitted radio collars not just on wolves but on cattle as well and he found that the wolves mingled with herds the whole time without—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bullshit!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why the hell don’t you just let her speak?’ shouted one of the WOE group.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why the hell don’t you go back where you belong and mind your own goddamn business?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck Calder stood up and raised his hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Our city friend back there is right. We asked Miss Ross along tonight and we should do her the courtesy of hearing her out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen nodded at him. ‘Thank you. The fact seems to be that wolves prefer to prey on wild rather than domestic ungulates. Over a period of six years in the Ninemile, they killed just three steers and one calf—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So how come they killed forty-three here in a couple of months?’ Ethan Harding called out. There was a loud murmur of support.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, we’re trying to get verification on precisely how many of those losses were in fact caused by wolves.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You calling us liars?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, I certainly am not.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck Calder leaned forward in his chair. ‘Maybe you could tell us, Helen, how many of these calves you have “verified” as wolf-kills so far?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen hesitated. It was the question she’d dreaded. Of the forty-three alleged losses, only five carcasses had been found and not one of them was recent enough for the cause of death to be established.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Miss Ross?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’ve still got some work to do on that. As you know, the evidence is a little thin on the ground—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But, so far, how many can you say for sure were killed by wolves?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen turned to Dan for help. He cleared his throat and was about to speak when Calder cut in:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think we should hear this from Miss Ross. How many?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, as I say, sir, we still have to—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So far, though?’</p>

  <p class="normal">The whole room went quiet, waiting for her answer. Helen swallowed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, so far. None.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was uproar. Everyone started shouting at the same time. Some of those with seats were getting to their feet. Behind them, the fiercest WOE woman was nose to nose with Ethan Harding.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The wolf’s an endangered species, you bozo!’ she yelled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, lady, <i>you’re</i> the endangered species!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Calder held up his hands and called for quiet. But it had little effect. Helen shook her head and picked up a glass of water. As she drank she looked at Dan and he shrugged, guiltily. Bill Rimmer was craning his neck, peering toward the back of the hall. Something was going on back there. The TV cameraman had turned right around and was clambering up on a chair to get a better shot.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen could see a truck had pulled up outside with its headlights pointing directly into the hall. Someone had climbed out of it and was walking toward the entrance, the lit rain sheeting down behind him. He pushed his way through the crowd out in the lobby and slowly it parted to let him through. He was in the hall now, elbowing his way through the hecklers, and as they saw him, they stopped their shouting and stepped aside.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Abe Harding.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was carrying something, a bundle of some kind, over his shoulder. Helen glanced at Dan and they both frowned.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What the hell’s he got there?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Looks like a rug or something.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Harding was clear of the hecklers now and heading down the aisle between the seats where most people had risen to their feet to get a better look at him. He was wearing a long yellow slicker that glistened with rain and made a swishing sound as he walked. He wasn’t wearing a hat and his grizzled hair was all bedraggled.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everyone was silent now and every pair of eyes upon him. He was wearing spurs which clinked with every footstep as he made his way toward the rostrum. He was staring at Helen with a kind of crazed intensity that would have been comical if it hadn’t been so scary. Helen hoped Dan’s two special agents had their guns handy.</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t until Harding reached the rostrum and stopped right in front of her that Helen noticed the blood rivering down his slicker and realized at last what the bundle of black fur on his shoulder was.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here’s your goddamn verification,’ Harding said.</p>

  <p class="normal">And he swung the dead wolf from his shoulder and dumped it on the table.</p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    By the time Helen and Bill Rimmer managed to get out of the community hall, Main Street looked like a war zone. It was blocked by four police cars and a fifth was blasting its siren as it tried to push its way through the crowd. Flashing red lights bounced and prismed in the store windows and made the great puddles of rain look like blood. It was coming down like a monsoon. Helen was soaked to the skin within seconds.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">A cop with a megaphone was asking people to move off and most were complying, negotiating a route through the puddles to their cars. Across the street now she caught sight of Dan. He and the two special agents were arguing with one of the cops who had arrested Abe Harding.</p>

  <p class="normal">She could see Harding now, still in his yellow slicker with his hands cuffed behind his back, being ushered into the back of one of the police cars. His sons were yelling at two other cops who were stopping them from getting to him. A little farther along the street, in the sheltered doorway of Iverson’s grocery store, Buck Calder was giving an interview to the woman from the TV station.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You okay?’ Bill Rimmer was looking down at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think so.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The moment after Harding had dumped the wolf, all hell had broken loose. One of the WOE men had gotten into a fight with the two loggers, but it had been broken up before anyone was hurt. In the ensuing chaos Helen had been shoved against a wall and a large rancher had stepped, accidentally, on her foot. That aside, she was just a little shaken.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dan looks like he’s got himself a problem over there,’ Rimmer said. He hunched his shoulders against the rain and headed across the street and Helen followed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You don’t have to do this!’ Dan was saying to the cop.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The man assaulted a police officer. Listen, it was you who asked for police backup in the first place.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah, but why take him away? He’s not going anyplace. All this’ll do is make a martyr of him. That’s what he wants, for Godsake.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was too late anyway. The car Abe had been bundled into was already moving off, sounding its siren to get through the dispersing crowd.</p>

  <p class="normal">In its lights, Helen suddenly caught sight of Luke. He was coming down the street bur hadn’t seen her. He seemed to be looking for someone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Luke!’</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned and saw her. He was wearing a brown waxed slicker, with the collar turned up. He looked very pale and very sad. When he came up to her, he tried to smile and gave a little nod that set the water streaming from the brim of his hat.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I w-w-was looking for you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Me too. I mean, in there. Did you see what happened?’</p>

  <p class="normal">He nodded. He glanced over to where his father was being interviewed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I c-c-can’t stay.’ He fished something from his coat pocket and handed it to her. ‘I f-found this. By the side of the road.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen took it and looked at it. It was a letter. The envelope was mudstained and the ink had run. But she could still recognize the handwriting as Joel’s. Her heart gave a little flutter.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’d better g-go now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, okay. Thank you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He nodded and turned and walked away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Luke?’ she called.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned and looked back at her and she suddenly realized how he must feel about what had happened to the wolf.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Will you come and see me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">He shook his head. ‘I c-can’t.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And he walked away in the rain and was lost in the crowd.</p>
