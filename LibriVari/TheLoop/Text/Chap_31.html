  <h2>30</h2>

  <div class="normal1">
    <b>T</b>he trial of Abraham Edgar Harding took place in late February and its third and final day was drawing to a doleful and predictable close. It was too warm to snow and too cold to rain and a compromise of sleet angled unforgivingly on the sorry band of Harding supporters who trudged up and down in the leaden light outside the Helena federal district court building.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">From the Saharan warmth of inside, Dan stood surveying them through a corridor window, while he waited for Helen to come back from the restroom. The jury had been out for half an hour and he wondered what on earth could be taking them so long.</p>

  <p class="normal">Outside, there were only eight demonstrators left and even as he counted, one more broke away and headed forlornly for his car. Spurred by his defection, the others boosted the volume of their chant, though from inside, it was like the dying drone of a bee in a bell jar.</p>

  <div class="atx1">
    <div class="ctag1">
      <i>What do we want?</i> <br/>

      <i>No wolves!</i> <br/>

      <i>How do we want them?</i> <br/>

      <i>Dead!</i>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="normal">On the first morning there had been fifty or sixty of them there, corralled by almost as many police at a safe distance from a smaller but equally voluble band of ‘pro-wolfers’. To the evident satisfaction of the assembled pack of photographers, press and TV reporters, the two sides heckled, chanted and brandished placards of varying degrees of wit and literacy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Some of the slogans had a pleasing symmetry: NO WOLVES, NO WAY! was mirrored merrily across the street by WOLVES, WAY! Some were more sinister, such as the one being touted by a dourly bearded young man whom Dan thought he remembered from the night of the meeting. He wore a camouflaged hunting cap and jacket and boots laced up to his knees. His placard said, FIRST WACO, NOW WOLVES.</p>

  <p class="normal">Many of the pro-Harding placards seemed to have been penned by the same hand or at least by hands similarly tutored, for the word <i>federal</i> was consistently spelled <i>fedral</i>, except on one where the <i>d</i> was missing too. WOLVES = FERAL TERRORISM, it proclaimed. Dan couldn’t decide if it was a mistake or represented some new, esoteric line of thought.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe had arrived that first morning like a celebrity who’d left his charisma at home. Still valiantly lawyerless, he had been chauffered to court - and no doubt coached all the way - by star defense witness, Buck Calder. Abe stood on the court steps, flanked by his grinning sons, and grimly repeated over and over again through tobacco-stained teeth to every question that he was an American citizen (which no one had doubted) and that he was here this day to defend his ‘alienable rights’ to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Wolves.</p>

  <p class="normal">Perhaps to indicate that the second of these rights might indeed prove alienable, federal judge Willis Watkins had urged Abe to reconsider both his plea of not guilty and his decision not to be represented by an attorney. But Abe would have none of it. It was a matter of principle, he insisted. As a result, twelve patient Montanans had sat through three days of tedium and testimony, waiting to reach a conclusion that only Abe’s most diehard fans could fail to deem foregone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan and Helen had given evidence the previous morning and were then cross-examined by Abe in a style that was staccato and surreal. He gave Dan the easier ride, shuffling through several high stacks of notes and leaving such epic pauses that twice Willis Watkins intervened to ask if he’d finished. His first question to Helen was whether, like he, she had fought for her country in Vietnam. When she pointed out that she had only just been born when the war ended, he gave a loud <i>Aha!</i> of triumph, as if the point were proven.</p>

  <p class="normal">He seemed to be under the impression that Helen had personally released the Hope wolves as part of a secret government program, whose purpose was to breed and train wolves to eat cattle so that ranchers went out of business and the government could grab their land. He tried to get her to admit that he’d caught her snooping on his property, carrying out a clandestine survey with that intent. He suggested to her that she was an ‘interfering bitch’ and got himself a stern rebuke from the bench. Helen handled it all with polite restraint and a face as straight as a marine on parade.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck Calder did his best to put a shine on Abe’s breastplate, testifying to the man’s ranching prowess, neighborliness and generally fine character. But Abe was beyond help. Declining to take the stand himself, he proudly declared in his final speech to the jury that he had deliberately killed the wolf, knowing it to be one. Which was pretty well all the prosecution had to show. He wound up by saying his only regret was that he hadn’t killed the other wolf he’d seen and maybe a few bunny-huggers too. If it was a joke, it didn’t go down too well with Judge Watkins.</p>

  <p class="normal">The streetlights were coming on outside now and Dan saw two more demonstrators had lowered their placards, long illegible with sleet. They were calling it a day.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dan!’</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked around and saw Helen hurrying down the corridor toward him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The jury’s coming back in,’ she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">It didn’t take long.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe Harding was found guilty on all counts. No one gasped or shouted or sobbed. A few supporters muttered and shook their heads. Abe stared steadily at the ceiling while Willis Watkins berated him in measured tones for wasting many thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money. Sentencing would come later, said the judge, pending reports. He left the court in no doubt however that Abe faced several months in jail and probably a substantial fine as well.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wes and Ethan Harding turned and glared venomously at Helen but either she didn’t notice or pretended not to.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s go get a drink,’ she quietly said to Dan.</p>

  <p class="normal">They got out of the building fast but not quite fast enough to avoid the media gang that had miraculously rallied in the short time since the verdict. TV crews were busy canvassing reaction from the sleet-sodden demonstrators and their drier, less devoted brethren who had materialized from their cars to join them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mr Prior? Mr Prior?’ a woman’s voice called out.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Buck Calder’s favorite TV reporter.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Just ignore her,’ Helen said.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the woman caught up, only steps ahead of her cameraman. Dan could see from the little red light on the camera that he was already being taped. To be seen ducking and running on the local news never looked good. He stopped and smiled warmly, hoping but doubting that Helen was doing the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I was wondering,’ the woman panted. ‘How do you feel about the verdict?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, justice, I believe, was done. But it’s not a happy day for anyone, humans or wolves.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you think Abe Harding should go to jail?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fortunately, that’s not for me to decide.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The woman shoved her microphone in front of Helen now.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What about you Miss Ross? Don’t you think a man’s got the right to defend his own cattle?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’d rather not comment,’ Helen said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Should he go to jail?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’d really rather not comment.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How did you feel when he called you an “interfering bitch”?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How do you feel when people call you one?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan intervened. ‘We’ve got to go now. Thank you very much.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He steered Helen off through the crowd.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why don’t you get yourself a proper job?’ someone yelled. Dan recognized the camouflage cap of the Waco poster man.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, buddy, if you’re hiring, I’m available.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wouldn’t hire you to wipe my ass.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lucky you only use it for talking then,’ Helen said quietly, without looking at him. But Dan could see the guy heard.</p>

  <p class="normal">They got clear of the crowd before either of them spoke again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who the hell is that?’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘One of my logger buddies. Works for the post and pole company. We share reflective moments together in the forest.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They both had cars and drove separately to a bar Dan thought none of the Harding supporters would be likely to choose for drowning their collective sorrows. Everything the place served was organically grown, from the corn chips to the beer, and the clientele were mainly students, vegetarians or both. The music was strictly New Age and there wasn’t an antlered head to be seen anywhere on the walls.</p>

  <p class="normal">They found a booth and ordered two wheat-beers on tap, from which Dan had to fish a large chunk of lemon. He could never understand why they put it in.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Has Luke heard back from the university?’ he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not yet. He sent them this great paper about the GIS work he’s been doing.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They’ll take him okay.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah. All he has to do is tell his father.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re kidding. He hasn’t told him yet?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nope.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen took a drink.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know, I can almost have a drink now without wanting a cigarette.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How long since you quit?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Four months.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s pretty good.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They were silent for a moment or two. Dan was wondering how best to broach a tricky subject that he’d been putting off mentioning for several weeks now. He took a long draught of beer and put down his glass.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Helen, there’s something I have to tell you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Going to fire me? It’s okay, I quit.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He smiled. ‘No.’ He paused. ‘It’s just that we’ve been getting these calls at the office.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She frowned.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It sounds like a different person each time and they never give their names and I’m sure it’s just somebody trying to stir some shit on account of this Abe Harding business, and frankly, I—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dan, for Godsake, will you stop blathering and tell me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s not easy, okay? It’s about Luke.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He saw her stiffen slightly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What about him?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I know he has to spend a lot of time up at the cabin, what with all the night-tracking and stuff you have to do. And that sometimes he has to stay over. But some folks are clearly getting, well, you know, the wrong idea.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh. And what might that wrong idea be?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, Helen. You know what I’m saying.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry, I really don’t.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan was starting to lose patience.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, I’ll spell it out. They’re saying you and Luke are having . . . some kind of affair or something.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Or something?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan looked away and cursed under his breath.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And you want me to tell you if it’s true or not?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ he lied. ‘You know damn well that’s not what I’m saying.’</p>

  <p class="normal">His cell phone started to ring.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Shit.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He rummaged for it and tugged it out of his coat pocket. The call was from Bill Rimmer. Some wolves had killed three calves near Boulder, he said. The rancher, who Dan knew well, was spitting blood. Bill said it was important that Dan come at once to try and calm things down.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Helen, I’m sorry. I’ve got to go.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She watched him put on his coat and finish his beer. He felt mean and guilty over what he’d said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll call you in the morning.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fine. I’m going to have another beer.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry. I got that all wrong.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, no problem.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned to go and as he stepped away she called his name. He stopped and looked back at her. She looked hurt; and beautiful.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In case you’re wondering,’ she said. ‘It is.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘True.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He drove to Boulder with his head whirring and his heart sinking slowly to his stomach.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    Helen was at the bottom of her second beer and thinking about a third when she heard the voice behind her.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure is a sorry thing when a pretty woman has to celebrate on her own.’</p>

  <p class="normal">That’s all I need, she thought. She turned and saw Buck Calder standing by the booth, leering down at her. There was snow on his hat and the shoulders of his jacket.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why should I be celebrating?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You got the verdict. Old Abe looks like he’s going down for awhile. I figure that’s what you wanted.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen shook her head and looked away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mind if I join you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mind if I ask what you’re doing in here?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I was heading home and I saw your pickup parked out there and thought I’d stop and say hi.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh. Well. Hi.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The waitress appeared and Buck ordered two wheat-beers.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thanks, Mr Calder, but—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah, well, anyway. Thanks, but I ought to be going.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned to the waitress. ‘It’s okay, sweetheart. Bring two. I’ll drink them both.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He eased himself onto the bench on the other side of the booth. Helen warned herself to go easy. However much she might dislike the man, he was Luke’s father. To upset him wouldn’t be good for either of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I wanted to talk about Luke,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen gave a little laugh. Here we go again, she thought.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why do you laugh?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh. Nothing.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked at her for a moment, with a faintly knowing smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I want you to know, whatever idle tongues may be wagging—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mr Calder—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Buck. I really don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The waitress arrived with the beers. He thanked her and waited for her to leave before he went on.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What I wanted to say was, just how grateful Eleanor and I are for all you’ve done for the boy, letting him work with you and all. Of course, it means we don’t see to much of him right now, and I have to say, I’m going to need him around now we’re getting into calving, which I hope you’ll understand. ’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But his mother was only saying the other night that she’s never seen the boy so happy. He seems at last to have grown up a little. Even his stutter seems to have gotten better. So, thank you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He took a drink. Helen didn’t know what to say. As usual, the guy had taken her by surprise. Perhaps she should curb her natural urge to flee and instead, while the going was good, broach the subject of Luke going to college.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You handled yourself real well, up there on the stand,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen shrugged and smiled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, I mean it. You were impressive.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank you. So were you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He nodded graciously. Neither of them spoke for a moment. The music they were playing was that stuff they made for insomniacs, a soothing blend of electronic waves and the moan of killer whales. It always made Helen feel edgy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know, I reckon if you and I hadn’t gotten off on the wrong foot, we might have been friends.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, we’re friends. As far as I’m concerned.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, then. More than friends.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She pretended to look puzzled. He gave her a slow smile. Then he reached beneath the table and put his hand on her leg. Helen took a deep breath and stood up.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry. I’m going home.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She put her coat on and got some money from her bag to pay for the drinks. He was sitting back watching her, smiling, totally unfazed. He was just making fun of her. She thought about throwing the untouched glass of beer over him and only narrowly decided against.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bye,’ she said and walked away.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was snowing hard. Hurrying across the parking lot, she slipped and nearly fell. She was so shaken and angry that it took her a long time to find her car keys. How <i>dare</i> he? She wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p class="normal">As she put the key in the door, she felt a hand on her shoulder and gave a little yelp of fright.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned her around and took hold of her arms below the elbows, pinning her against the truck.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why settle for a boy when you can have a man?’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">She tried to keep her voice steady. ‘Get your hands off me. Now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, we both know you’re hot for it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He leaned his face toward her and she felt his warm, beery breath on her face. She brought her knee up sharply between his legs and shoved him hard in the chest. He reeled backward, slipped in the snow and fell heavily, his hat rolling off to one side.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen climbed quickly into the pickup, slammed the door and locked it. Thank the Lord, the engine fired first time. He was still lying there, moaning and clutching his crotch. She lowered the window.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t <i>ever</i> touch me again.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She hit the gas pedal and the Toyota slithered off. Suddenly, through her shock and outrage, something he’d once said came back to her. She braked hard and skidded to a stop, then reversed back so that she was looking right down on him from the window.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wanting something can be better than getting it, remember? Think of it as a favor.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And she drove off, showering him with wet snow from her wheels as she went.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    They finished supper in silence. Or rather, Luke finished his while she shifted hers around on her plate. The plan had been for Helen to get something fresh in town after the court case finished, but she’d forgotten, so Luke had cooked the usual pasta and mixed in a can of tuna, some cheese, then a can of sweetcorn. He still wasn’t much of a cook, but it tasted okay.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">He could tell something was wrong as soon as she came in, but whatever it was, she wasn’t letting on. Maybe she was still upset about what Abe had called her in court yesterday. About what had happened there today, she had told him little more than the verdict and the encounter afterward with their logging friend. Luke had figured on telling her his worries that something funny was going on with the wolves, but it didn’t seem the right time. She pushed her plate away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t great.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, it was fine. I’m just not hungry.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When I get to college, I’m going to take cookery class too.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She tried to smile. He got up and went around to her side of the table, stepping over Buzz who was in his usual place, flat out by the stove. He squatted beside her and took both her hands in his.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What’s the matter?’</p>

  <p class="normal">She shook her head and bent forward and kissed his forehead.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She sighed. ‘Luke, I don’t think you should stay up here anymore.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘W-why?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know what people are saying.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He nodded. ‘I d-didn’t know if you knew.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She gave a wry laugh. ‘Oh, I know all right.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She told him about the anonymous calls to Dan’s office. Luke wondered who it could be, but couldn’t think of anyone that mean.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So are you saying we should stop seeing each other?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. Oh, Luke, I don’t know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If it’s making you unhappy . . .’</p>

  <p class="normal">She stroked his face. ‘I couldn’t bear not seeing you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Does what other p-people think change what we have?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How can it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Luke, there are just some people who always try to destroy what they don’t understand or what they can’t have for themselves. ’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘B-but if you listen to them, they win.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She smiled down at him. Sometimes, with just a look, she could make him remember how young he was and how much he had yet to learn of the world’s hurtful ways.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I love you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh Luke, please—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s okay. Y-you don’t have to say it too.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The last guy I said it to left me. For a Belgian bimbo.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know any B-belgian b-bimbos.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It almost made her laugh.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Listen, I’m not going to be able to come up here much anyhow for a few weeks. My f-father wants me to help with the calving.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He told me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You spoke with him? What did he say?’</p>

  <p class="normal">She shrugged. ‘Just that.’</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    The wolf lay halfway up a narrow gully, wedged between two rocks like a piece of flood-jammed timber. His nose was stretched out on his paws as if he were about to pounce and his eyes were open and frozen a solid, dull yellow. His fur was covered in a thin blanket of spindrift that had swirled down the gully. How long he had been dead, it was hard to say.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">They had picked up the signal shortly after dawn, not the usual, intermittent beep, but a single sustained note that told them something had happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s dead,’ Helen had said, as they loaded their skis and the rest of the gear onto the snow-mobile. ‘The collar might just have come off. It happens.’</p>

  <p class="normal">But she didn’t believe it. They’d gone on the snow-mobile as far as they could up the trail that ran beside the creek, the signal getting louder all the time. Both of them were aware it was the last time they would be tracking together for a month or more and they hardly spoke. When the going got too difficult, they put their skis on and threaded their way through the trees and rocks. There were fresh wolf tracks but only the one, unbroken signal. The pack had moved on.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Luke who saw the body first. When they climbed up through the rocks they found a crevice, littered with scat and pieces of bone. It seemed the wolf had sheltered there for some time. In a patch of fresh snow among the rocks, they could see the tracks of several wolves. Perhaps they had come to pay their last respects.</p>

  <p class="normal">His body was frozen hard and it took them a long time to lever him out from the rocks without damaging him further. They laid him down beside the creek.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look at his foot,’ Helen said. ‘That’s what’s killed him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They knelt down to examine it. The whole paw was stripped of fur and was swollen to at least three times the size of the others. There was a deep open gash which went all the way around it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You poor old fella. What have you been up to, huh? It looks like he’s been caught in a trap or something.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Or a snare, like Buzz,’ Luke said. ‘Same f-foot too.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen took off the collar and stopped the signal. She stood up and sighed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And then there were seven.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t reckon there’s that m-many anymore.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She looked at him. ‘How do you mean?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Remember when Dan and I w-went flying, how we only saw five of them? And he said the others were p-probably in the trees or somewhere? Well, these last few days, while you’ve been in court, I’ve g-gotten the feeling that’s all there is now. Maybe not even that many. I know a lot of the time they go in each other’s tracks, b-but when they separate, it looks like there’s only three or four of them, far as I can tell. And I heard them howl and it wasn’t the same. K-kind of thinner.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They carried the dead wolf to the snowmobile and took it back to the cabin. Helen called Dan and he said he would have Donna drive out right away and pick it up. He’d get Bill Rimmer to have a look, then send it up to Ashland for a full necropsy report. Helen told him it looked like a snare wound.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Luke thinks someone’s trying to get rid of them,’ she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Poachers set snares for all kinds of animals. Poison’s still the best way to kill a wolf.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Except it kills lots of other animals too and tells the whole world you’re there.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So does a snare. I think the boy’s being a little fanciful.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen told him what Luke had said about never seeing more than four or five sets of tracks. When Dan replied, his voice had gone hard.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Helen, I don’t want to sound ungrateful for Luke’s help, but you’re the goddamn biologist. It’s you we’re paying, not him.’</p>
