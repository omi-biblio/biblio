  <h2>13</h2>

  <div class="normal1">
    <b>H</b>ope’s fairground had known better days. It lay in a dusty sprawl of pasture at the back end of town and for most of the year played host to cottontails, gophers and occasional parties of high school rebels who used it for illicit midnight drag racing.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">The rails around the pens and the rodeo arena hadn’t seen a paintbrush in years and the bleachers were so rickety and splintered that only the most bolstered or reckless dared sit on them. Around the perimeter was a straggle of exhibit booths whose roofs had been warped to a matching tilt by winter winds, providing nesting space for various kinds of bird.</p>

  <p class="normal">In times gone by, the place had been busy all around the calendar with craft markets, gun shows and various parades and rodeos. There used to be an annual Mountain Man Rendezvous, to which fantasists in beards and buckskin flocked from several neighboring states, and a Testicle Festival, which for awhile enjoyed even greater popularity, except perhaps with the calves who supplied the food, euphemistically served as ‘prairie oysters’. COME TO HOPE AND HAVE A BALL, the posters urged. But as the years went by, fewer and fewer did.</p>

  <p class="normal">One by one, all these events had either petered out or sought more salubrious locations elsewhere. The only survivor of any consequence was the Hope Labor Day Fair and Rodeo and even this had now been forced, by dint of stronger competition elsewhere, to change its name and shift from Labor Day to mid-September, in the process shrinking from three days to a single Saturday.</p>

  <p class="normal">The fair had always climaxed with a concert and a pitchfork fondue, in which hunks of beef the size of small dogs were speared and cooked in drums of boiling oil. In previous years, the concert had attracted some medium-to-big country music stars. This year, however, top of the bill were Rikki Rain and the Ragged Wranglers, who had come all the way from Billings and, for a few precarious moments, seemed set to go all the way back without playing a note.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had parked their two customized black RVs by the cattle pens and as they climbed out, the first thing Rikki saw was a poster on which someone had scrawled <i>who?</i> right under her name.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck Calder and several members of the fair’s organizing board who had turned out to welcome her had been treated to some vivid advice on where they could stick their godforsaken, horseshit apology for a fair. The offending poster had been rapidly removed and at last the late afternoon sunshine, a drifting smell of pitchforked steak and some serious Buck Calder sweet-talk seemed to have prevailed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor sipped her iced tea beside one of the concession stands and watched her husband across the crowd. He had his arm around Rikki now and she was tossing back her peroxide curls and laughing raucously at something he’d said. She was wearing a black shirt, red cowboy boots and a pair of white jeans so tight that Eleanor feared for her circulation.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Finest set of dentures I ever did see,’ Hettie Millward said, following Eleanor’s gaze. ‘I reckon she looks a sight more ragged than the Wranglers.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor smiled. ‘Hettie, you don’t need to say that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, doesn’t she? Anyhow, I didn’t think Buck was on the board this year.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He isn’t. You know Buck, if ever there’s a damsel in distress. ’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Some damsel. Look at her shirt all unbuttoned there. Talk about mutton dressed as lamb.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Undressed.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They laughed. Hettie was her best friend, the only one who came close to understanding how it was between her and Buck. She was a big-hearted woman, constantly at war with her weight, though it was a war she seemed happy to lose. Doug, her husband, was a friend of Buck’s - and one of Hope’s most popular and respected ranchers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor changed the subject and asked Hettie about her daughter’s wedding plans, which seemed to change every week. Lucy was getting married next spring and wanted it to be the ‘wedding of the millennium’. The whole of Hope was going to be invited. Hettie told her the latest idea, which she thought absolutely insane, was to have the whole ceremony conducted on horseback. Bride and groom, best man and bridesmaids, even the minister, for heavensakes, were going to be on horses. Hettie said it was a surefire recipe for disaster.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then she looked at her watch and said she had better go and find her two boys, who had just won blue ribbons in the 4-H calf classes. Their animals were going to be auctioned and the parade was about to start in the main arena.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Charlie says he’s looking for at least three dollars a pound. I told him if he got three hundred it wouldn’t pay for all the misery those animals have put us through. I just want to be shot of them. I’ll see you later, honey.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor finished her tea then strolled along the row of exhibit booths whose dilapidation was disguised by colored flags and streamers that fluttered in the breeze. There were booths selling anything from dogtags to jars of homemade chokecherry jelly. One had been transformed into a tepee outside which a group of teenage girls stood giggling while they waited to have their fortunes told by a ‘Genuine Indian Medicine Man’. Farther along, smaller and noisier children were throwing wet sponges at two volunteers from the town fire department, bravely smiling in cut-out faces of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett.</p>

  <p class="normal">It had been many years since Eleanor had last come to the fair, though Buck, whose glory days were well remembered by older folk who watched the rodeo, never missed it. Eleanor had stopped coming after Henry’s accident, fearing she might glimpse her dead son’s face among the crowds of kids waiting to show their steers or clamoring for hot dogs and soda at the concession stands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, it had been her idea that Paragon should take a booth and, making her way back toward it, she was relieved to have found no ambush of pain. In fact, she was proud that one of her first suggestions as Ruth’s new business partner had worked out so well. The warm weather had brought out the crowds. They had sold as much here in one day as they did in the shop in a whole week and had easily covered the fifty-dollar rental for the booth.</p>

  <p class="normal">As she came up to the booth, she saw Ruth staring at something across the crowd. She had a strange, almost angry expression on her face. Eleanor followed her gaze and saw that it must be Buck she was looking at. He was still making a fool of himself with that singer woman.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was touching, Eleanor thought, that Ruth should care.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    Buck wished Rikki and the Wranglers all the best and said he’d see them after the show, although he wasn’t so sure he would. Rikki had looked a whole lot better from a distance than she did at close range and the wink she gave him as she went off to her van did little for him. With his wife and his mistress chatting away to each other like best buddies at the booth over there, life was complicated enough, thank you very much.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">He’d seen Eleanor go off to the concession stand and had been about to head over to grab a quiet word with Ruth, when he’d gotten waylaid sorting out Rikki Rain’s ego problem. Now he’d missed his chance. Being a pillar of the community was tough sometimes. He felt Eleanor’s eyes on him and headed off in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck loved the fair and rodeo, though it wasn’t half the show it had been when he was a kid. In those days the whole county used to turn out, as well as hordes of people from far and wide. Winning a rodeo event back then really counted for something. Some of these kids nowadays hardly knew which end of a horse the hay went in. There was a bigger crowd here today than there had been in years, but it still wasn’t the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">He followed his nose to one of the long trestle tables where the meat from the pitchfork fondue was being carved. As he walked past the arena he noticed a huddle of youngsters, mainly girls, gathered around a tall man in a pale blue shirt and a tanned young woman in a tight white dress.</p>

  <p class="normal">Both seemed to be signing autographs and, with their backs to him, Buck didn’t recognize them. A photographer he recognized from the local newspaper was taking pictures. The man in the blue shirt said something Buck couldn’t make out but which was obviously hilarious because all the folk gathered around him roared with laughter. As the couple turned to go, all smiles and little waves, Buck saw it was that TV anchorman fellow, Jordan Townsend, who had bought the Nielsen place for a small fortune two summers ago.</p>

  <p class="normal">Townsend had his own show on one of the networks (though Buck had never seen it) and apparently flew himself up here now and again from LA, parking his personal jet in Great Falls and helicoptering himself out to the ranch, which some other outsider had been brought in to manage.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had knocked Jim and Judy Nielsen’s nice old house down and replaced it with something ten times the size. It had a huge hot tub overlooking the mountains and a proper thirty-seat movie theater in the basement.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck joined the end of the line waiting for food. In the old days the folk dishing it out would have noticed him and brought him a plate stacked high, for free. Not today though. It was being served by two spotty kids he didn’t know.</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited his turn and watched while Jordan Townsend and his cute little wife processed like royalty through the crowd. Townsend was doing his Hollywood best to pass as a cowboy. With his carefully faded workshirt and Wranglers, he was wearing a new Stetson and a pair of handtooled boots which must have cost a thousand dollars or more.</p>

  <p class="normal">His wife (number three, according to Kathy) had a pair too, but it was her only western concession. Otherwise, in her designer sunglasses and that little white dress she was almost wearing, she was every inch the movie star. Which, by all accounts, was what she was, though no one Buck knew had seen any of her movies. Apparently she had two names: one she was known as professionally and one she liked to go under when incognito in Montana. Buck couldn’t remember either.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rumor had it that she was twenty-seven, exactly half her husband’s age, but Kathy said you had to take this with a pinch of salt because most actresses spent several years being twenty-seven. The only other thing Buck knew about her (though, if he tried, he could imagine more) was that her Christmas present from Townsend last year was a small herd of bison.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck reached the head of the line and paid one of the spotty kids his three dollars for a plate of steak and chili beans. He stood to one side and took a mouthful while the golden couple glided by, nodding and smiling at the natives, Buck included.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hi, how’re you doing?’ Townsend said. Buck knew the guy had no idea who he was.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good. How are you doing?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Great. Good to see you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And he breezed on past. Asshole, thought Buck.</p>

  <p class="normal">The steak was tough and greasy and Buck chewed it balefully, watching the sway of the actress’s cute little ass as she and Townsend processed toward the parking lot with the righteous glow of local duty done.</p>

  <p class="normal">It seemed wrong to hate people you hadn’t met, but Buck couldn’t help it. They and their type were buying up the whole damn state. There were some places you could hardly move for all the millionaires, moguls and movie stars. It seemed you were nobody in Hollywood or New York City unless you had a ranch and a slice of Big Sky country.</p>

  <p class="normal">The result was that real estate prices had gone so far through the roof that decent, young, born-and-bred Montanans didn’t stand a chance. Some of the newcomers kept the land working, or tried to, but most either didn’t have a clue or else didn’t care. It was just somewhere they could play cowboys and impress fancy friends they invited from the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck tried the beans and found they weren’t any better than the steak. He was looking about for a garbage bin when he saw Abe Harding’s troubled face heading through the crowd toward him.</p>

  <p class="normal">That’s all I need, Buck thought.</p>

  <p class="normal">They’d been neighbors for thirty years and in all that time had never really gotten to know each other. You could fit Abe’s place twenty times into the Calder spread and still have space to spare. The land was a lot poorer too and it was well known that Abe had borrowed too much money on it and was always on the brink of bankruptcy. With those eyes peering out from under a frowning shelf of eyebrow, he looked like some kind of paranoid, rock-dwelling eel.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hi there, neighbor, howya doin’?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe nodded. ‘Buck.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe scratched his nose and darted a look around him like someone about to pull a heist. His jaws moved restlessly on a wad of tobacco and you could see the brown juice at the corners of his mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Got a moment?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure. Like some of this food? It’s good.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. Mind if we take a walk?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe led the way, not saying another word until he was sure they wouldn’t be overheard.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What can I do for you?’ Buck said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know that wolf that killed your Kathy’s dog?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Uh-huh. Reckon he had one of our calves too.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So I heard. This wolf. He was a big, black fella, right?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, we’ve seen him again. And he had two others with him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Up on the allotment. We were up there, putting some new salt and mineral down and we heard this howl and Ethan says, “That’s the weirdest coyote I ever heard.” Then we saw them, plain as day, three of them. This big fella and two gray ones.’</p>

  <p class="normal">All the while he spoke, his eyes kept on the move, rarely meeting Buck’s and then only for a moment. As though he were filled with something itchy and resentful.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Were they going for the cattle?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, but they sure as hell were thinking about it. If I’d had my gun with me, I’d have had ’em. I left Ethan up there and went home to get it, but they took off. Couldn’t even find their tracks.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck thought for a moment.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you told that biologist girl about it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Nope. Why should I tell her? Feds put them there in the first place. Damn woman asked if she could tramp all over my land. I told her what she could do with herself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck shrugged.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I tell you, Buck, I can’t afford to lose a single calf right now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know what you mean.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m not so sure you do, but it’s the truth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But you know, Abe, you go shooting them and get yourself caught, you could wind up in a whole lot of trouble. Jail even.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe spat a cheekful of black juice onto the pale grass.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Goddamn government. They lease you the land, take your money, then let these varmints loose to kill your cattle.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then throw you in jail if you try and protect ’em. Doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, does it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Abe didn’t reply, just narrowed his eyes and looked off across the fairground toward the stage area where the band were unloading their gear.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thing is, we’re going to gather early and bring the herd down where we can keep a better eye on them. I was wondering if you’d mind lending a hand.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure I will.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Appreciate it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You bet.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I tell you, there’ll be hell to pay if there’s any of ’em missing.’</p>

  <div class="normal1">
    Luke had only come down to the fair because he’d promised his mother he would. He didn’t plan on staying long. Rikki Rain and the Ragged Wranglers were one good reason to leave. They’d been playing for an hour now and it seemed a lot longer. Another good reason was that Luke had just spotted a group of kids he had graduated with, including Cheryl Snyder, who he’d had a thing about all through high school.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Her dad owned the gas station and she was one of the nicest and definitely the prettiest girl in the school. As a result, she was usually surrounded by the worst kind of guys, four of whom were now showing off to her and her friend Tina Richie outside the fortune-teller’s tepee.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke was on his way back to the Paragon booth with some sodas for Ruth and his mother who were busy packing up everything they hadn’t sold. Cheryl and the others didn’t appear to have seen him and he was about to duck between the booths and take a detour around the back when he heard her call out.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Luke! Hey, Luke!’</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned and pretended to be surprised. Cheryl waved and Luke smiled and held up the sodas to show he couldn’t wave back, wondering if that was enough and could he still escape. But she was heading toward him, the others sauntering behind. She was wearing blue jeans and a skimpy pink top that showed her midriff. Luke remembered, as he often did, that time they’d kissed at a New Year’s party a couple of years ago. She was the only girl he’d ever properly kissed. Which at his age was downright pitiful when you came to think about it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, Luke, how are you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, hi, Ch-Ch-Cheryl. I’m f-f-fine, thanks.’ Tina and the others came up alongside her and Luke smiled and nodded at them and they either smiled back or said hi with varying degrees of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I haven’t seen you all summer,’ said Cheryl.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, well, I’ve been w-w-working on the ranch, you know. H-h-helping my d-d-d-dad out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He watched their eyes, as he always did when he stuttered, for any hint of laughter or embarrassment or of pity, which was by far the worst. The other two he could handle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hey, Cooks, we saw you on the TV, when that wolf got your sister’s dog,’ Tina said. One of the boys, a loudmouth called Jerry Kruger, gave a comic howl. He’d made Luke’s life a misery for awhile in junior high, until Luke knocked him out cold one day in the yard. Luke’s reputation had soared. He’d never had to use his fists again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you seen it again?’ Cheryl said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The wolf? No. He was p-p-probably just p-p-passing through.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Too bad,’ Kruger said. ‘Tina was hoping to play Little Red Riding Hood with him. “Oh Grandma, what big bazongas you’ve got!”’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Jerry, why don’t you grow up?’ Cheryl said.</p>

  <p class="normal">No one seemed to know what to say next and they stood there for a moment, listening to the raucous tones of Rikki Rain. Luke held up the sodas.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’d better be g-g-going.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay,’ Cheryl said. ‘See you around.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They all said goodbye. As he went off, Luke heard Kruger laugh and say, ‘P-p-probably just p-p-passing through,’ and the others telling him to hush.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    It was cooler now and Helen wished she had brought a sweater. She was wearing hiking shorts and boots and a T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up. She had Band-Aids over the teeth marks Abe Harding’s dogs had made on her legs. Amazingly, the skin wasn’t pierced.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Most of the people she had met over the past weeks were here at the fair and, with the exception of the Hardings, she’d chatted with all of them. Everyone had made a fuss of Buzz, who was having the time of his life. She had him on a leash but he’d still managed to forage several suppers among the scraps people had dropped.</p>

  <p class="normal">She knew it was time she was going. She had a late night ahead of her. But with everyone around her enjoying themselves, she was reluctant to leave. It was partly, she realized, a simple hunger for human contact.</p>

  <p class="normal">At other times, in other moods, she might equally have let herself feel excluded or envious, the way she sometimes did lately when she saw a pair of young lovers or (God, she was so <i>pathetic)</i> women her age with babies. Instead, today, she had simply let herself bask in the banter and bustle of the crowd and felt more at peace with the world than she’d been for a long time.</p>

  <p class="normal">Observing the people of Hope on this sun-washed September afternoon, she had found herself moved by their sense of community, by the roots that seemed to hold them to this place and to a way of life that, despite years of tribulation and all the mad rushings of the world, endured in its essence unchanged.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen’s favorite rancher, Doug Millward, seemed the epitome of all this. When they bumped into each other, he had insisted on buying her an ice cream. He bought one for himself as well and they’d stood eating them, watching the high school band parade. He was a tall, soft-spoken man, with kind blue eyes. She knew he didn’t much care for wolves but he seemed to have a tolerant respect for what she was trying to do. She confided that someone had been sabotaging her traps and when he heard what had happened at the Hardings’, Doug sighed and shook his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It probably won’t make you feel any better about him, but Abe’s had a tough time of it over the years.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I heard he was in Vietnam.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah. Saw some bad things, so they say. I’ve never heard him talk about it. But I do know he has a lot of trouble making ends meet. And those boys of his aren’t a whole lot of help. Been in and out of trouble since they were kids.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What kind of trouble?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, this and that, you know. Nothing too serious.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She could see he was reluctant to spread gossip. He watched the band in silence for a moment, as if working out how much to tell her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They hang out with one or two fellas who, let’s say, I wouldn’t be happy for my kids to spend time with.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Like who?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Couple of them work for the logging company. Into all this militia stuff, you know - antigovernment, big on guns, that kind of thing. A while back, they and Wes and Ethan Harding got caught illegal hunting. They cornered a whole herd of elk in a canyon, just mowed them all down.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He paused. ‘I’d appreciate you not telling anyone where you heard that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, of course.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And they’re the exception not the rule. There’s a lot of real good people live in this town.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly he laughed. ‘Hey! We’re getting a little serious here, Helen.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He said he had to go and meet Hettie at the 4-H sale and after they said goodbye, Helen wandered off, thinking about what he’d said.</p>

  <p class="normal">The crowd was thinning now and some of the booths were packing up, which was more than could be said for the band. Rikki Rain was wailing on about her man being out somewhere doin’ with someone else what she was doin’ without at home. Helen didn’t blame him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The sun had slipped behind an anvil of red and purple cloud above the mountains. But suddenly now it found space among them to set the fairground aglow, turning every face to gold as if casting a final blessing on the day’s events. As she walked along the line of booths, a rabble of small children exploded around her and ran ahead, chasing each other and laughing at their giant shadows that raced before them on the grass.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was then that she spotted Luke Calder talking with his friends. She watched and listened unseen. His stutter came as a surprise. And when that little creep imitated him, she had felt like marching over and slapping him on the face. She was sure Luke must have heard. He was heading off through the crowd and because it was the same way to the parking lot, she found herself following him.</p>

  <p class="normal">She had only seen him twice since that first day, once in town and once on his horse up in the forest. On both occasions he had seemed shy and avoided talking with her. She knew he was spending a lot of time up on his father’s allotment, to keep an eye on their herd. But whenever she was over that way, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was at the Paragon booth now, saying goodbye to his mother and Ruth. Then he set off toward the parking lot and Helen followed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Luke?’</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned and stopped and when he saw her, his eyes seemed for a moment to show alarm. Then he smiled nervously and touched his hat to her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, hi.’</p>

  <p class="normal">As she walked up to him, she realized how tall he was, a good six inches taller than she was. Buzz clearly thought he’d found a long-lost friend and Luke squatted to stroke him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We haven’t really had a chance to meet yet,’ Helen said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m Helen.’ She held out her hand to him but he was too busy being licked by Buzz to see.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah, I kn-n-know.’ He noticed her hand just as she was about to let it drop. ‘Oh, sorry, I d-d-didn’t . . .’ He straightened up and shook hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And your new friend for life here is Buzz.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘B-Buzz. He’s . . . cute.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen was suddenly as tongue-tied as he was and the two of them stood there for a few seconds, smiling at each other like halfwits. She waved an arm in a clumsy gesture that was intended to take in the fair, the mountains, the sunshine and everything she’d been feeling about them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Isn’t this all great? My first rodeo!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You t-took p-p-part?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No! I mean, the first rodeo I’ve ever been to. God no. Me and horses: disasterville.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘D-disasterville. That’s good.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You don’t ride in the rodeo?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Me? Oh. No.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re not staying for the music?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh. No. I’ve g-g-got some th-things to do. Do you like it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen frowned and scratched her head. ‘Well . . .’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke laughed and his big green eyes softened, giving Helen a glimpse of what he might really be like. But his shy defense was quickly back in place.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hear your dad talked them into staying.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He nodded. ‘He’s real g-g-good at that k-kind of thing.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked away across the fairground, all trace of laughter gone now and it occurred to her that having Buck Calder for a father wouldn’t be easy for any boy. There was another awkward silence. Luke had turned his attention to Buzz again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, I’m afraid I still haven’t managed to find your wolf.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked at her sharply. ‘Why <i>m-m-my</i> wolf?’</p>

  <p class="normal">She laughed. ‘I don’t mean yours, you know, personally. I meant—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I never saw him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen could see his cheeks coloring up.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, I know. I was just—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’d b-b-better be g-g-going now. Bye.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, okay. Bye.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen stood there a moment, wondering what she’d said wrong. They made their separate ways to their cars. She waved as Luke drove off, but he didn’t wave back, nor look in her direction. She followed his car out of town but he was driving faster and when she turned off the pavement, he was only a distant cloud of gray dust ahead of her.</p>

  <p class="normal">She stopped at the row of mailboxes at the turning up to the lake, even though she had checked hers already on the way into town. It had been empty, as it usually was. Since coming to Montana she’d had letters from her mother, her father and two from her sister. But none from Joel. The last she’d heard from him was a belated birthday card in Cape Cod and in all those long weeks she must have written him five or six times. Perhaps he hadn’t received them? Or perhaps he couldn’t get letters out? She guessed mail and things like that must be difficult there.</p>

  <p class="normal">The letters she had written lately had been determinedly cheerful. She described the place to him, told him the detail of her routine, joked about her failure yet to catch a wolf. But sometimes she wondered if a whiff of her true feelings, of her loneliness, of the aching hollow he had left in her, had somehow infected her words without her knowing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buzz watched dolefully from the pickup while she opened the lid of her mailbox. It was empty.</p>
