  <h2>3</h2>

  <div class="normal1">
    <b>B</b>uck Calder was baptized Henry Clay Calder III but he had never been too keen on the idea of being third or even second to anyone, and both to those who liked him and to those who didn’t, he’d always been much more a Buck than a Henry.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">The nickname came when, at fourteen, he carried off every prize on offer at the high school rodeo, revealing only when all was safely won that he had two broken fingers and a cracked collarbone. Even back then, the name’s more carnal connotation was not lost on the more knowing of his female classmates. He was already the object of wide-eyed whispers and once of a stern and exclusively female inquisition when his name was found on a wall of the girls’ toilets, coupled in rhyme with a word from which it differed by only one letter.</p>

  <p class="normal">Had any of these girls seen fit to share such secrets with their mothers, they would perhaps have found less surprise than they might have expected. For a previous generation of Hope schoolgirls had flushed with similar feelings for his father. Henry II, by all accounts, had practiced a particular method of kissing that a girl never quite forgot. A winning way with women, it seemed, swam strongly in the male Calder gene pool.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of Buck’s grandfather, Henry I, no such intimate detail endured. History bore witness only to his great resilience. It was he who in 1912 had loaded a few cows and chickens, a young bride and her upright piano onto a train in Akron, Ohio, and headed west.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they got there, they found all the best land had already gone and Henry ended up filing a claim way out by the mountains where no one had yet been rash enough to try. He built his homestead where the big ranch house now stood. And while countless others gave up, driven out by drought, wind and winters that killed even the hardiest stock, the Calders somehow survived, all but the piano, which after the journey never quite sounded the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">Henry bought the land his neighbors couldn’t make pay and, little by little, the Calder ranch spread wider and deeper down the valley toward Hope. With dynastic ambition, he named his first son after him and set about making the linked HC brand something to be proud of.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck’s father never went to college but every moment he wasn’t chasing women, he spent reading everything he could lay his hands on about rearing cattle. He would have the library order special books he’d heard about and get livestock magazines shipped all the way from Europe. His father thought some of the articles the younger Henry read to him too newfangled but he was always smart enough to listen. It was at his son’s urging that he switched from a commercial to a purebred Hereford operation. And the more he handed over decisions, so the more the herd thrived.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck grew up with all the confidence and not a little of the arrogance such status can give a child. No ranch was bigger than theirs, no rancher smarter than his daddy. There were some who expected - and others who secretly hoped - that the legendary Calder drive might dissipate in this third Henry’s veins. Instead, it seemed to redouble. He had two older sisters and two younger brothers but it was clear from the start that he was the only proper heir to the empire.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buck went to college in Bozeman and learned all about genetics. And when he came back, he helped take everything a step farther. He started keeping an individual file on every animal they reared, charting its performance in minute detail. Birthing ease, mothering skills, weight gain, disposition and much more were scrutinized and ruthlessly acted upon. The progeny of those who made the grade flourished; those found wanting went swiftly to the wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">As a philosophy, it differed little from the one to which ranchers and farmers had adhered for years. Weeding out poor stock was hardly revolutionary. But the rigor with which it was applied on the Calder ranch was. Buck’s changes improved performance dramatically in every area and soon had stockgrowers talking across the state. The first Henry Calder died content that his line would stretch strong and glorious to the century’s horizon.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Buck had only started. With the old man gone, he argued that they should switch from raising purebred Herefords to Black Angus. He argued that they made better mothers and soon everyone would be going for them. His father said he must be out of his mind. It would be throwing away everything they’d worked for all these years. But Buck persuaded him to let him try raising some Black Angus of his own, just to see.</p>

  <p class="normal">Almost immediately his small herd was outperforming the Herefords on every count. His father agreed to switch the whole herd, and within a few years, their reputation for purebred Black Angus surpassed all competition. Calder-bred bulls and the richness of their seed were renowned throughout the West and beyond.</p>

  <p class="normal">With his own seed, the young Buck Calder was somewhat less discriminating. He was generous with his favors and traveled widely to bestow them. There wasn’t a decent whorehouse from Billings to Boise that he hadn’t graced with a visit. He would boast that a real man had three unalienable rights: life, liberty and the pursuit of women.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were two kinds of women he pursued and the ones he dated knew nothing of the ones he paid. What made this surprising was that several of the former had brothers or male cousins who knew all too well about the latter. One or two of these young men had indeed witnessed Buck unbuckling and roared at the Calder motto, coined in his cups one bawdy night, that all you had to do with women was ‘Buck ’em and chuck ’em’.</p>

  <p class="normal">His friends’ silence on these matters, born less of loyalty perhaps than fear of self-incrimination, allowed Buck to be seen, throughout his twenties, as nothing worse than what some still quaintly called a ‘lady’s man’, which did little to prevent him simultaneously being seen, except by bad sports and the inordinately perceptive, as Hope’s most eligible bachelor.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the time he turned thirty, most women his age, including those he’d so excited at high school, had sensibly looked and found elsewhere. All were married and most were mothers and Buck by now was dating their younger sisters. Like his father before him, his eyes came at last to settle on a young woman ten years his junior.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor Collins was the daughter of a hardware store proprietor from Great Falls and had just finished her training as a physical therapist. Buck was one of her first patients.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had strained a shoulder hauling a broken hay wagon from a creek. The last time he had come to the clinic he’d been stretched and pummeled by an older woman whom he’d later mocked as having the looks and charm of a Russian tank commander. So when he saw this young goddess step through the door of the consulting room, he thought she must be an assistant or nurse.</p>

  <p class="normal">She wore a white coat that fitted close enough to show Buck’s practiced eye the kind of figure he liked best, slim and lithe and full-breasted. She had skin like ivory and long black hair, held up with tortoiseshell combs. She didn’t return his smile, just fixed him with her wonderful green eyes, asked him what the trouble was and told him to take off his shirt. Dear Lord, Buck thought, as he unbuttoned, it’s like something you read about in <i>Playboy</i> magazine.</p>

  <p class="normal">Had Eleanor Collins succumbed to the charm he instantly applied, had she agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee at lunchtime, had she so much as smiled even once, things might have turned out differently.</p>

  <p class="normal">Months later she would tell him that she’d been nervous as a chipmunk that day; that as soon as she’d laid eyes on him, she’d thought this was the man for her and how hard it had been to mask her feelings with professional cool. As it was, Buck left the clinic with both his shoulder and his heart aglow. And from the latter alone, he knew this was more than just another buck-and-chuck, for normally he felt the glow in a baser place. No. He had met, at last, the woman he would marry.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of the cautionary signs to which Eleanor might have paid heed, perhaps the most telling was the quiet, resigned sadness in the eyes of Buck’s mother. It could have shown her what grim toll there was to pay for living with a firstborn male Calder. But Eleanor saw in her future mother-in-law only a shared and understandable adoration for this handsome, charming power-house of a man, a man who had chosen her from all the women in the world to share his life and bear his children.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her refusal to sleep with him before they were married only stoked Buck’s passion all the more. Eleanor remained a virgin until their wedding night, whereupon she dutifully conceived. It was a boy. His name was not up for discussion. Two daughters, Lane and Kathy, followed at intervals of roughly two years.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Only breed your best cow every other year,’ Buck said to his drinking pals at The Last Resort. ‘That’s the way to get prime beef.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a description that he could honestly apply to the first three of his children. Henry IV was a firstborn Calder to the core and sometimes when the two of them were out hunting or rounding up cattle or fixing a fence, Buck would shake his head with pride at the boy’s easy, unwitting emulation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dear Lord, he thought, the power of the seed. And then he’d look at young Luke and think again.</p>

  <p class="normal">This second son didn’t look like a Calder at all. It had taken Eleanor four years to have him and during that time something seemed to have happened to the Calder genes. The boy was the image of his mother: the pale Irish skin, the dark hair, the same watchful green eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, he sure is his mother’s son,’ Buck joked in the hospital when he first laid eyes on the child. ‘No telling who his daddy is though.’ And ever since, even in front of the boy, he’d gone on referring to Luke as ‘your son’.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was said in jest, of course. He was far too proud to think that any man would dare cuckold him or that any woman of his would allow it. But secretly he felt his genes had somehow been denied access to the boy. Or worse, that they had been admitted and failed. And he felt this even before Luke began to stutter.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ask for it properly,’ Buck would tell him at the table. He didn’t shout. He’d say it gently, but firmly. ‘Say, “Please may I have the milk.” That’s all you have to say, Luke.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And Luke, just three years old, would sit there and try and fail and keep trying and keep failing and he wouldn’t get the milk until he cried and then Eleanor would go and hug him and give it to him and Buck would yell at her, because how the hell was the boy supposed to learn if she did that every time, for Christsake?</p>

  <p class="normal">As Luke grew, so did his stutter. And the space between his words seemed linked in some organic process to the space that opened little by little in the midst of the family, he and his mother on the one side, everyone else on the other. More than ever, he became Eleanor’s son and soon he was to be her only one.</p>

  <p class="normal">On a snowy November day, when Luke was seven years old, two Henry Calders, his older brother and his grandfather, were killed in a car wreck.</p>

  <p class="normal">Young Henry, just fifteen years old, was learning to drive and it was he at the wheel, when a deer sprang out before them. The road was like greased marble and when he swerved, the wheels locked and the car slithered and launched itself into a ravine like a wingless bird. The rescue team reached it three hours later and with flashlights found the snow-sprinkled bodies in a tree, frozen and entwined, as if in some fabulous balletic leap.</p>

  <p class="normal">With seventy-six years on the clock, the older Henry’s death was the more easily absorbed. But the loss of a child is an abyss from which few families return. Some claw their way again toward the light, perhaps finding a narrow ledge where, in time, memory can shed its skin of pain. Others dwell in darkness forever.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Calders found a kind of nether twilight, though each by a different route. The boy’s death seemed to act on the family with a force that was centrifugal. They could find no comfort in collaborative mourning. Like shipwrecked strangers, they each struck out for shore alone as if fearful that in helping others they might be dragged beneath the waves of grief and drown.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lane and Kathy fared best, escaping as often and for as long as they could to the homes of their separate sets of friends. Their father meanwhile, like a brave pioneer, strode forward in manly denial. Unconsciously impelled, perhaps, to spread some compensating genes, Buck sought sexual solace wherever he could. His philandering, only ever briefly curtailed by his marriage, took on new zeal.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eleanor retreated to a distant inner land. She would sit glazed for days before the TV. Soon she knew every character in every soap and saw the same issues and faces come around again and again on the morning shows. She would watch wives yell at cheating husbands and daughters berate mothers for stealing their clothes or their boyfriends. She shocked herself sometimes by yelling along too.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she grew tired of that, she tried drink. But she could never quite get the hang of it. Every kind of liquor she tried tasted terrible, even if she drowned it in orange or tomato juice. It made her forget, but only the wrong things. She would drive all the way to Helena or Great Falls only to find she had no idea why she was there. She drank with such graceful discretion that no one ever suspected, even when they ran out of bread or milk or she served the same meal two nights running or, once, forgot to serve one at all. In the end she decided she wasn’t cut out to be alcoholic and simply stopped.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Luke who felt her distance most keenly. He noticed how she often forgot to come and kiss him goodnight and how she rarely hugged him anymore. She still protected him from his father’s rage, but wearily and without passion, as if it were a duty whose purpose she had forgotten.</p>

  <p class="normal">And so the boy’s quiet harvesting of guilt went undetected.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the day of their death, his brother and grandfather had been on their way to fetch him from his speech therapist in Helena. And with the unsullied logic of a seven-year-old, this fact alone made the accident his fault. With one stroke he had slain his father’s father and best-beloved child, the ancient king and heir apparent of the Calders.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was indeed a splendid burden for a boy to carry.</p>
