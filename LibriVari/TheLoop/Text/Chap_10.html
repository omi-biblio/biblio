  <h2>9</h2>

  <div class="normal1">
    <b>L</b>uke Calder leaned back in his chair and waited while his speech therapist rewound the videotape. She had just taped him reading a whole page of <i>This Boy’s Life</i> and he had managed it with only one block, and although it was a big one, he felt pleased with himself.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Through the window he watched a double trailer-load of cattle that stood shuddering at a red light, a row of pink noses poking wetly through the slatted sides. It was only a little after nine in the morning but already the streets of Helena were shimmering in the heat. On the way in, he’d heard the radio weatherman promising rain. Barely a drop had fallen all summer. The traffic lights went green and the cattle truck rumbled off.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, kiddo, let’s have a look.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Joan Wilson had been helping him with his stutter for about two years now. Luke felt easy with her. She was a tall, genial woman, maybe a few years older than his mother, with rosy cheeks and eyes that disappeared behind them when she smiled. She seemed to have an endless supply of exotic earrings, which Luke thought was odd because otherwise she dressed like a Sunday school teacher.</p>

  <p class="normal">Joan worked for a cooperative that covered some of the more remote schools in the area. Luke had always looked forward to her weekly visits. At the start he’d had joint sessions with a younger boy, called Kevin Leidecker, which Luke had found hard because the boy’s stutter was nowhere near as bad as his own.</p>

  <p class="normal">He’d liked Leidecker well enough, until he overheard him in the locker room one day doing an imitation of ‘Cookie’ Calder, blocking on <i>To be or not to be</i>. It was pretty good; had the other kids almost wetting themselves. Luke’s nickname (some preferred ‘Cooks’ or ‘Cuckoo’) came from the stabbing stutter he often got into when asked to say his name.</p>

  <p class="normal">A year ago, the Leideckers had moved to Idaho and since then Luke had had Joan to himself. During school vacations, instead of her coming to see him, he came to see her and, every Wednesday morning, drove himself to this private clinic.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had used the video a few times before, usually to practice some new technique or to help him see what he was doing physically. when he blocked. Today it was because lately, in addition to the tightening he always felt around the mouth, he’d found himself blinking and skewing his neck to the left. Joan said this was quite normal. It was what they called ‘secondary characteristics’. She was videoing him so they could both examine what was going on and see if they could do something about it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first time they used the video, she’d been worried it might upset him to see himself on the screen, but it didn’t. It was like looking at someone else. His voice sounded weird, especially when he came near to a danger word and did that nerdy, smiling thing. Joan always told him how handsome he was, which was nice of her but, of course, just therapist bullshit. To his own eye he looked like a frightened bird, likely at a second’s notice to spread his wings and fly away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Screen-Luke was doing pretty well. He was sailing through words that often knocked him flat, M words and P words like <i>music</i> and <i>Paris</i>. He even got through <i>Hohner Marine Band</i> but that was only because everything was easy compared with what was coming.</p>

  <p class="normal">He’d already spotted it up ahead and as it got nearer and nearer he knew he wasn’t going to make it. He heard Screen-Luke’s voice begin to brace itself, like the engine of a car straining on a mountain pass. And then, as he came up to the M of <i>Moulin Rouge,</i> he took a great gulp of air and his mouth locked and pushed forward and he started to blink. He’d run smack into the brick wall and for five, six, seven seconds he was stuck there, his face pressed into it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I l-look like a fish.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, you don’t. Okay, let’s stop it there.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Joan pressed pause and froze Screen-Luke pouting in mid-blink, confirming what he’d just said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look. Fish.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You saw the words coming.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Was it something to do with it being in French maybe?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know. I don’t think so. It’s no b-big deal. I just wish I didn’t b-blink like that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She wound the tape back and played it again, and this time showed him where he was tensing up. You could see the muscles in his face and neck contract. She got him to say the phrase several times over and think about what his tongue and his jaw were doing as he said it. Then she got him to read the whole thing again and this time, although there were a couple of minor blocks and repetitions, he didn’t blink or twist his neck once.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘See?’ Joan said. ‘You were right. No big deal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He shrugged and smiled. They both knew that success here was one thing; doing it in normal life was another. Sometimes he could spend a whole hour talking with Joan and not block at all. Then he’d go home and his father would ask him a simple question and he would completely seize up, even if the answer was yes or no.</p>

  <p class="normal">Talking with Joan didn’t count. Just like it didn’t count when he talked with animals. He could talk all day to Moon Eye or the dogs, as if he’d never stuttered in his life. But it didn’t count. Because it wasn’t like the real world where words had such terrifying importance. Apart from Joan, there was only one person in the world he could talk with easily (well, two, if you counted Buck Junior who didn’t yet understand a word, which was probably why it was okay) and that was his mother.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was the only one who didn’t look away when he got into trouble. And if he blocked, she just waited patiently and the tension would slip out of him like water from a tub. It had always been like that.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could remember her grabbing him up from the supper table and carrying him away to safety when his father was insisting he ask properly for something. Luke would sit there going redder and redder while the wall in front of the word he was trying to say got higher and higher and then he would start crying and his mother would leap up and take him away to another part of the house where they would sit in the dark and listen to his father ranting and raving until the door slammed and his car roared off into the night.</p>

  <p class="normal">That was the real world. Where a little word like <i>milk</i> or <i>butter</i> or <i>bread</i> could raise a hurricane that would sweep through the whole house and leave everyone in it sobbing and hollering and quaking with terror.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the video work, Joan got him to do some voluntary stuttering, doing it deliberately to get him used to having control over his speech. She said this might help with the blinking too and he might try practicing it on his own along with his other exercises. The one he’d been working on lately was to make meaningless sounds, get the voice flowing like a river, then just let the words float out on it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then they did some role-playing which was more for fun than anything and normally ended up with them both helpless with laughter. Joan was a frustrated actress and always gave it all she’d got. Last week she’d been the bad-tempered owner of a concession stand at a ball game and Luke had to chat about the game and order some popcorn and two Cokes. He could always make her crack up by throwing something in, like last week, when he’d asked her to marry him. Today she was a mean traffic cop who had just stopped him for speeding. She checked his papers, handed them back and then leaned toward him and sniffed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you been drinking?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not much, ma’am.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not much. How much?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Just five or six beers.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Five or six beers!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, ma’am. And a bottle of w-whiskey.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke could see her lips begin to quiver.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, that’s it. You’re booked.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Joan always avoided eye contact when she was about to laugh and now she shook her head and pretended to write something on a notepad beside her on the desk. Then she tore off the sheet and handed it to him. Luke studied it. It was her shopping list.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ma’am, I d-don’t understand.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ve booked me for Po-Pop-Tarts and p-pantyhose.’</p>

  <p class="normal">That did it. She started to shake and by the time they’d stopped laughing it was ten o’clock and the session was over. They both stood up and she put an arm around his shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re doing okay, kiddo. You know that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke smiled and nodded and she stood back and gave him a look. Nodding, like all avoidance tricks, was strictly forbidden.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m d-doing okay,’ he said. ‘Okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She walked him out and along the corridor that led to the lobby.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How’s your mom?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘She’s fine. She said to say hi.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you still planning on putting college off till next year?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Uh-huh. My dad thinks it’s a g-good idea.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And what do you think?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, I don’t know. I g-guess so.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She peered at him as if something in his face might show this to be a lie. He smiled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I do. Really,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Joan knew about him and his father. They’d talked about it right from the start and though Luke, through some baffling sense of loyalty, had spared her much, she clearly believed his father was largely to blame for his stutter. Luke often got the feeling, however, that her dislike ran deeper and was maybe colored by what had happened with one of her predecessors, a much younger woman than Joan, to whom his father had taken a shine. Her name was Lorna Drewitt and she had been Luke’s speech therapist for about a year before he discovered what was going on.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was during the Christmas vacation when Luke was twelve years old. His father had come to collect him from the clinic and told him to wait in the car while he ‘settled up’ with Miss Drewitt. Luke had been sitting in the dark parking lot for ten minutes when a man knocked on the window and said his car was boxed in and could they move theirs to let him out.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke ran back into the clinic to tell his father and didn’t think to knock on Lorna’s door. Like a total jerk he just burst in and, in that splinter of a second before they sprang apart, he caught the two of them pressed together against the filing cabinet and plainly saw his father’s hand up inside her hoisted sweater, cupping her breast.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lorna quickly rearranged herself and pretended to be searching for something in the cabinet while Luke stood there, feeling his face begin to glow, and tried to say that there was a man outside who wanted to move his car. But he ran aground on the first M and stayed stranded there like a beached whale until his father came over and said quietly,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s all right, son. I’m coming.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They drove all the way back home in silence and no mention was ever made of what his father must have known Luke had seen. That was the last he saw of Lorna Drewitt, though later he heard she had moved to Billings, a town his father still often visited on business.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whether Joan knew of this particular incident or of some similar one, Luke wasn’t sure. Perhaps all she knew was his father’s famed womanizing, which Luke later discovered at school was common knowledge. Whatever the reason, Joan took little trouble to hide her feelings and when Luke had first told her he wasn’t going straight to college that fall, she’d gotten all worked up and said that the sooner he got away, the better he and his stutter would be.</p>

  <p class="normal">They said goodbye in the clinic lobby and Luke put his hat on and stepped out into the blast of white sun and across the parking lot.</p>

  <p class="normal">Driving out of Helena, he mulled over what Joan had said about him needing to get away. She was probably right. He knew full well why his father wanted him to do a year’s work on the ranch before going to college.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke had his heart set on studying wildlife biology at the University of Montana in Missoula, a place his father thought infested with liberals and ‘bunny-huggers’. He wanted Luke to follow Kathy’s example and do agribusiness management at rancher-friendly Montana State in Bozeman and was hoping that a year of practical ranching might make his son see sense.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke was happy enough to go along with it, though for an entirely different reason.</p>

  <p class="normal">It meant he could go on watching the wolves. And if the need arose, as he feared it might, perhaps he would be able to protect them.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    There was no one to be seen when he got back to the ranch. His mother’s car was gone and he figured she must be up at Kathy’s or had maybe gone into town. There was another car Luke recognized as belonging to the local vet, Nat Thomas. He parked the old Jeep beside it and got out. Their two Australian cattle dogs came rushing to greet him and bounced beside him as he walked up the dusty slope to the house.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">He called hello when he came through the screen door into the kitchen but there was no reply. His mother had left something cooking in the oven. It smelled good. Everyone would soon be coming in for lunch. Wednesday, after his session with Joan, was now the only day he got to eat with the others. Every other day, since his father had given him the job of riding the herd up on the allotment, he just took sandwiches and ate them on his own. It suited Luke just fine.</p>

  <p class="normal">He headed up to his room to change into his work clothes so he could ride out directly after eating.</p>

  <p class="normal">His room was upstairs on the southwest corner of the house. From the west-facing window you could see the head of the valley where the forest began and, beyond it, the mountains whose tops were often veiled with cloud.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was really two rooms, knocked into one. The other half, through an open archway, had been his brother’s. And though, over the years since the accident, Luke had gradually colonized some of it, Henry was still very much present.</p>

  <p class="normal">Some of his clothes still hung in the closet. There were shelves crammed with his high school photographs, sport trophies and his collection of hunting magazines. Hanging from a hook on the bottom shelf was what had once been his most treasured possession: a baseball mitt autographed in faded ink by some superannuated star. <i>Go Henry,</i> it said, <i>Hit ’em big</i>.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke sometimes wondered if his parents had ever discussed clearing it all away. He guessed it must be hard to know what to do with a dead child’s possessions. Hiding them might be as bad as leaving them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The shelves in Luke’s half of the room were filled with books and a museum-like clutter of things he had picked up in the mountains. There were rocks of strange color and pattern and shape, gnarls of old wood like the faces of trolls and fossilized fragments of dinosaur bone. There were bear claws and feathers of eagles and owls and the skulls of badger and bobcat.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were stacks of books, some of which he read again and again - Jack London, Cormac McCarthy and Aldo Leopold - and books about animals of almost every kind. Hidden among them, as others might hide raunchy magazines, were the ones about wolves. He had more than a dozen of them, some by old-timers like Stanley P. Young, but mostly those of more modern writers, like Barry Lopez, Rick Bass and the great wolf biologist David Mech.</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke looked at his watch. He had about an hour to kill before the others showed up for lunch, so he decided to do some of Joan’s voice exercises. He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes and began what she called the ‘body scan’. Breathing slowly and deeply, he consciously relaxed every muscle in his body. Each time he breathed out, he ‘sounded it’ with a soft moan. Little by little, he felt the tension slacken.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he pictured in his mind, as Joan had told him, that his voice was a river, flowing from his mouth, and that he could let words, any words, whatever nonsense came into his head, gently float upon the river and out into the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Me oh my, how I love cherry pie. Float with the pie, let the pie float by . . .’</p>

  <p class="normal">The river flowed out through his open door and along the corridor where particles of dust glittered in a wedge of sun, then on and down, to the listening house below.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My mom’s cherry pie floated up to the sky.’</p>

  <p class="normal">After awhile his voice grew sleepy and slow, as if the river were forming a lake and the water slowly swirling, filling the house until at last he fell asleep and the silence regathered, stirred only by the lowing of a distant calf.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was how the house mostly was nowadays: silent and empty of all but memories. It had been that way since Luke’s sisters had moved out, first Lane, who had married a real estate agent from Bozeman, then Kathy.</p>

  <p class="normal">You noticed it most of all in the living room, from which all the other downstairs rooms radiated. It was a large room, with a broad-plank cedar floor and walls of swirled white plaster, framed in pine. At its far end stood a stone hearth where, on winter nights, great logs would crackle and roar and still be there glowing at dawn. Above it, a hooded black iron flue towered toward heavy beams, burnished by decades of smoke to the color of molasses.</p>

  <p class="normal">The walls of the living room were hung with samplers and tapestries, stitched with mystical patience by Luke’s grand-mother and her mother before her. Here too, as well as photographs of all the Henry Calders, were the antique wall clocks that Luke’s mother had once collected.</p>

  <p class="normal">The cases of these clocks were oblong and made of maple. On their glass-paneled fronts, below the dial, each was decorated with its own hand-painted scene, mostly depicting animals or birds or flowers. There were four clocks now and once there had been five, until Luke’s brother managed to smash one showing off his roping skills to the girls and earning himself a thrashing from his father.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a time when their mother had kept all the clocks in time and good repair. Every Sunday she would wind and adjust them so they chimed the hour in unison. Visitors had often expressed wonder that anyone could bear to live amid such clang and clatter but Eleanor would laugh and say no one in the family ever heard it, which was mainly true, although Luke could remember once having a nightmare about them when he was little. It was when he was having one of his regular bouts of tonsillitis and in his fever he had dreamed that the ticking was really the snicker of cutlasses and that a band of bloodthirsty pirates was creeping up the stairs to get him.</p>

  <p class="normal">All of these clocks were now silent. They had been that way for more than ten years. Whether it was a deliberate symbolic gesture or simple neglect, no one dared ask, but since Henry’s death, his mother had never again wound them. And because they were hers alone and maybe served some private purpose in her grief, no one else had touched them. Dustily, they registered the several times of their own demise.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were other adornments on the walls, both here and elsewhere in the house, which, for Luke at least, carried greater significance. These were the mounted heads of animals killed by four generations of Calders, all of whom had been great hunters. His brother had shot his first elk at the age of ten, which was both illegal and a great source of pride to his father. The head was mounted above the door to the kitchen and one of Henry’s favorite tricks was to toss his hat onto the antlers from twenty feet across the room. It hung there still.</p>

  <p class="normal">As a child Luke had always found these trophies disturbing. When he was four years old, his brother had confided to him that the animals weren’t in fact dead and that even though they couldn’t move, their brains and eyes still functioned.</p>

  <p class="normal">For the best part of a year Luke believed his every move was being watched, his every deed assessed. The most important of the heads, his brother told him, was that of a huge moose their grandfather had shot and which had pride of place at the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If any of the others see you doing something bad they tell the old moose,’ Henry had whispered. Luke was aware that his sisters were looking on with great seriousness, but he kept his wide eyes locked on Henry. ‘And the moose keeps a count of all these bad things and when you’ve done too many, he’ll come and get you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How m-m-m-men—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How many bad things do you have to do?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know, Lukey, I’m not sure. But I tell you, when I broke that old clock of Mom’s, he came to my room in the middle of the night and boy, did he give me a whupping.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘W-w-what w-with?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Those great big antlers of his. Uses them like a paddle. And I tell you, they hurt a hell of a lot worse than Daddy’s belt. I couldn’t sit down for a whole week.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Every night when he went upstairs to bed, Luke made a silent confession to the moose and told him he was sorry for everything he had done wrong that day, a list which by now, often as not, included stuttering in reply to his father’s meal-time demands and any consequent eruption. And even after his mother found him doing this one bedtime and assured him it wasn’t true and Henry got another thrashing from his father, it was a long time before Luke could again walk comfortably beneath the moose’s nose or sit in any room where there were heads on the wall and feel certain he wasn’t being watched.</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t that he was afraid of them. He’d never been afraid of any animal. Already he had found that it was easier to make friends with them than it was with human beings. The ranch dogs, cats and horses, even the calves, always seemed to come to him rather than to others. When his stutter started, he used to get around it by talking through Mo, an old glove-puppet that had once looked like a fox but became so worn and darned that it soon didn’t look like anything. Through Mo’s mouth, he could talk as fluently to people as he could through his own to animals. In the end it drove his father mad and Mo was banished to a locked closet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Perhaps because of his brother’s joke about the trophies, perhaps because of those defiant genes that made him so unlikely a Calder, all that Luke had ever feared in animals was their judgment. Not simply of himself, but of all his species. He saw the wrongs they suffered at man’s hands and knew, by virtue of his own strictured tongue, how it felt to be unable to speak out against oppression.</p>

  <p class="normal">A ranch was not the easiest of homes for one of such sensibility, though Luke had always done his best to conceal it. He helped with jobs that his conscience abhorred, such as holding calves down at branding time while their balls were chopped off and the smoke of their seared flesh filled his nostrils with nausea. He ate meat, although its taste and texture often made him want to gag.</p>

  <p class="normal">To find favor with his father, he had even gone hunting and in so doing achieved the opposite.</p>

  <p class="normal">Six years after his brother’s death, his father had asked him if he wanted to try for his first elk. Luke was thirteen and had been dreading the invitation while at the same time feeling hurt that it had taken so long to come.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two of them rode out before dawn under a mottled November moon that lit the breath of the horses and made shadows of them on the sequined snow. An hour later they were up in the forest, standing silent with the horses on a high crag while they looked back to see the sun scale the world’s rim and turn the snow-swept plains to a sea of crimson.</p>

  <p class="normal">His father always knew where they were most likely to find elk. It was the place where Henry had shot his first buck, a hidden canyon where a herd would often shelter and feed when the snow lay thick. Luke had come here on his own many times to watch. But never, until this day, to kill.</p>

  <p class="normal">They left the horses and went the final mile on foot, taking care to stay on the safe side of what little wind there was. The snow was fresh and fluffy and not deep enough to bother them, though now and then one of them would sink to the hips in a hidden drift. They barely spoke and when they did it was in whispers. Otherwise, but for their breathing and the creak and crunch of their boots in the snow, the forest was still. Luke’s heart was thumping and he prayed, crazily, that his father couldn’t hear it and that the elk could and would take flight and save themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">His father carried the rifle. Usually he hunted with a 30-06 Springfield or the .300 Magnum he had bought the previous fall. But today he had brought only the .270 Winchester, the same weapon that Henry had used to fell his first elk six years earlier. It had less recoil than the others and in practice a few days earlier Luke had hit the target time after time. His father had been thrilled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You shoot darn near as straight as your brother,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took them more than an hour to reach the lip of the canyon. They crawled into the sheltered hollow of an old pine and peered through the gap between its lowest branches and its girdled drift of snow. His father handed him the binoculars.</p>

  <p class="normal">The elk hadn’t heard his heartbeat. Across the canyon, there was a herd of maybe twenty cows. A little way off, a solitary bull with five-point antlers was nibbling bark in a stand of quakin’ asp. He was less than two hundred yards away. Luke handed the binoculars back to his father and wondered if he dared say that he didn’t want to go through with it. But he knew that even if he were to try, the words would never come out; their effect would be too catastrophic.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not a six-point like Henry’s, but he’ll do,’ his father whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘M-m-maybe we should w-w-wait till we find a s-s-six-point. ’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you crazy? That’s a fine animal. Here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He carefully passed the rifle. Luke knew that a single touch on the tangle of branches above them would dislodge a pile of snow and maybe spook the elk. He toyed with the idea of doing it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Take your time, son. Take it real slow now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">His father helped him ease the barrel out through the gap. The hollow of the tree smelled strongly of resin and Luke wondered why it should make him feel sick when it never had before. He pressed the butt of the rifle into his shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get yourself comfortable now. Find a good place for your elbows. How does that feel? Okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke nodded and put his eye to the scope. The eyepiece felt clammy against his skin. For a moment all he could see was a racing blur of snow-covered trees and the striated gray rock of the canyon wall above.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I c-c-can’t find him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘See that patch of blowdown? The cows are directly below it. Can you see them?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’&gt;</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Take your time, it’s okay. He’s at two o’clock from where the cows are.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he saw them. They were stripping moss from the bark of the fallen trees. He could plainly see their eyes when they lifted their heads and stood chewing. The crosshairs of the scope moved from one animal to another, panning their pale bellies inside which by now calves were starting to form.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Got him?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The bull was tugging a piece of bark from a sapling and when it came free the tree quivered, sprinkling his head and antlers with snow. The intimacy of the scope was shocking. Luke could make out individual hairs on the dark neck. He could see the grinding of the jaws as the elk chewed, see the paler patches around the liquid black eyes that impassively surveyed the cows, see droplets of melted snow on his nose.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He looks k-k-kind of young to have his own herd. M-m-maybe there’s a b-b-bigger bull around somewhere.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hell, Luke, if you won’t take him, I will.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Half of Luke’s brain screamed at him to hand his father the gun right then. But the other half assessed this moment for what it was: a final chance to <i>be</i> something in his father’s eyes. He must take this creature’s life for his own to have any value.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was breathing fast and only in the very top of his chest as if his lungs were three-quarters closed. His heart was pumping so hard he thought it might burst and he half hoped it would. He could feel his blood pulsing in the flesh pressed against the eyepiece of the scope. The crosshairs moved on the elk’s head and body like a yo-yo.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Easy now, son, easy. Take a deep breath.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He felt his father’s eyes on him, judging him. Comparing him, no doubt, with how Henry had been that day.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you want me to take him?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ Luke snapped. ‘I c-c-can do it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ve still got the safety on, Luke.’</p>

  <p class="normal">With twitching fingers, Luke felt for the catch and clicked it off. The elk had lowered his head to the tree again and was about to strip more bark when something made him hesitate. He raised his head and lifted his nose to the air. Then, suddenly with every sense alert, he turned and seemed to look directly into the lens of the scope.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Has he seen us?’</p>

  <p class="normal">His father was looking through the binoculars and didn’t answer for a moment.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He’s sure gotten a whiff of something. If you’re going to do it, Luke, do it now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke swallowed.</p>

  <p class="normal">His father went on, his whisper urgent now, ‘The rifle’s sighted in at two hundred and that’s about where he’s at. There’s no wind, so it’s line of sight, just the way you see it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Take him just behind the shoulder.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know!’</p>

  <p class="normal">The elk was still looking at him. The blood was roaring in Luke’s ears. It was as if the world had become a tunnel with only two living creatures in it, he at one end and the elk at the other, staring back at him, into his mind and deeper still, as if scouring the darkest corners of his heart. And finding there perhaps a glimpse of death, the animal jerked in alarm and began to move away.</p>

  <p class="normal">And at that precise moment, Luke pulled the trigger.</p>

  <p class="normal">The elk jolted and stumbled. Below, the herd of cows erupted and headed as one for the cover of the trees.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You got him!’</p>

  <p class="normal">The bull was on his knees but then he stood again and moved off in a broken, uncertain run through the aspens. Luke’s father was pushing himself headfirst out of the tree hole.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you sure?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sure I’m sure. Come on!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke followed, pushing himself out through the snow into the glare of the sun. His father was already standing up.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here, I’ll take the rifle. Let’s get over there. He’s not going far.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And his father set off down the slope, wading strongly through the snow with the rifle held high and Luke followed in his tracks, half blinded by the sun and falling so often that soon he was covered in snow and all the time saying, whether out loud or to himself, he didn’t know and didn’t care, <i>Oh God, please don’t let me have done this and if I have, please let him live, please let him get away. Oh please.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">When they got to the stand of aspen they found blood in the snow and they followed its spattered trail up into the ribbon of pine that fringed the foot of the canyon wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">They heard the elk before they saw him. It was a sound Luke had never heard before and would never forget, a kind of low, throaty scream, like the broken door of a derelict house creaking in the wind. From the tracks, it seemed that the elk had stumbled and disappeared over a ledge of rock. Luke’s father carefully edged his way along it through a snow-drifted tangle of scrub and peered down.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here’s your baby, Luke. You got him in the neck.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke felt his chest contract. The elk’s screaming was relentless now and its echo in the canyon so terrible that he had to fight not to block his ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, Luke. You’ve got to finish the job. Careful as you go, it’s steep here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke walked along the ledge not caring if he fell, dreading with every step what he was going to see. He came alongside his father and peered down. The ground fell away steeply in a tumble of sliprock. About halfway down there was a dead tree which had snagged the elk’s fall and he lay wedged there, watching them, while his hind legs thrashed useless in the air below. There was a dark hole in his neck. His shoulder and chest ran slick with blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">His father racked another bullet into the chamber and handed him the rifle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There you go, son. You know what to do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke took it and, as he did so, felt his mouth quiver and the tears flood in his eyes and he tried so hard to stop it but he couldn’t and his whole body started to shake with sobs.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I c-can’t.’</p>

  <p class="normal">His father put an arm around his shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s okay, son. I know how you feel.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Luke shook his head. It was the dumbest thing he’d ever heard. How could anyone know how he felt? Least of all his father who must have seen this kind of thing a dozen times.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ve got to do it, though. He won’t be yours unless you do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t w-w-want him!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, Luke. He’s in pain—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You think I d-d-don’t know that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then finish the job.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I can’t!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Of course you can.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Y-y-y-you do it.’ He handed back the rifle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A hunter finishes what he’s started.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m not a g-g-goddamn hunter!’</p>

  <p class="normal">His father looked down at him for a long moment. It was the first time Luke had ever cussed in front of him. Then, in what looked more like sadness than anger, his father shook his head and took the rifle.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Luke. I don’t think you are.’</p>

  <p class="normal">His father shot the elk through the neck again and they watched it jerk and kick its legs in the air as if its soul was flying to some far-off place. Then, with its eyes never leaving them, it stiffened and gave a long, gurgling sigh and at last was still.</p>

  <p class="normal">But that wasn’t the end of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">They got a rope on the carcass and pulled it out of the tree from below. And there his father made him help skin it out and field-dress it. This was the deal, he explained, as he slit the belly and reached up inside to sever the windpipe and haul out the elk’s steaming heart and liver and lungs. If you hunted, this was what you had to do. It was a sacred moment, he said. And they sawed off the head and then cut the body into pieces so that they could pack it out. And Luke wept in silence all the while, wept at the feel and smell of the elk’s warm blood on his hands and wept for himself and his shame.</p>

  <p class="normal">They hung what they couldn’t carry from a high branch so coyotes or any late-denning bears couldn’t get it. And when they left the place, with the antlered head swaying crazily above the meat strapped to his father’s shoulders and more meat strapped to his own, Luke looked back and saw the gut piles and the snow soaked wide with blood and it occurred to him that if there were indeed such a place as hell, this was how it must look and where surely now he belonged.</p>

  <p class="normal">The elk’s head was never hung on the wall with the others. Perhaps his mother forbade it, after hearing what had happened; Luke never knew. But even now, five years later, he still sometimes conjured it in his dreams, leering at him from some unexpected place. And he would wake whimpering and soaked with sweat, among the twisted sheets of his bed.</p>
