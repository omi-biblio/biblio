  <p class="subtitle">Note</p>

  <p class="normal">Nuthanger Farm is a real place, like all the other places in the book. But Mr. and Mrs. Cane, their little girl Lucy and their farmhands are fictitious and bear no intentional resemblance to any persons known to me, living or dead.</p>

  <p class="subtitle">Acknowledgements</p>

  <p class="normal">I acknowledge with gratitude the help I have received not only from my family but also from my friends Reg Sones and Hal Summers, who read the book before publication and made valuable suggestions.</p>

  <p class="normal">I also wish to thank warmly Mrs. Margaret Apps and Miss Miriam Hobbs, who took pains with the typing and helped me very much.</p>

  <p class="normal">I am indebted, for a knowledge of rabbits and their ways, to Mr. R. M. Lockley's remarkable book, <em>The Private Life of the Rabbit</em>. Anyone who wishes to know more about the migrations of yearlings, about pressing chin glands, chewing pellets, the effects of over-crowding in warrens, the phenomenon of re-absorption of fertilized embryos, the capacity of buck rabbits to fight stoats, or any other features of Lapine life, should refer to that definitive work.</p>
