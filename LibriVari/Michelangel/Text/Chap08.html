  <h1>BOOK EIGHT:<br/>The Medici</h1>

  <p class="normal">Pope Julius II survived the completion of the Sistine vault by only a few months. Giovanni de' Medici, the first Florentine to be elected to the papacy, was the new Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood in the Piazza San Pietro among the Florentine nobles who were determined to make this the most lavish procession ever to be seen in Rome. Ahead of him were two hundred mounted spearmen, the captains of the thirteen regions of Rome with their banners flying, the five standard-bearers of the Church carrying flags with the papal arms. Twelve milk-white horses from the papal stables were flanked by a hundred young nobles in fringed red silk and ermine. Behind him were a hundred Roman barons accompanied by their armed escorts, the Swiss guards in uniforms of white, yellow and green. The new Pope, Leo X, mounted on a white Arabian stallion, was shaded from the warm April sun by a canopy of embroidered silk. Next to him, dressed as the standard-bearer of Rhodes, was Cousin Giulio. The lone figure in mourning was the Duke of Urbino, nephew of Julius.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gazing at Pope Leo X, his heavy bulk perspiring from the weight of the triple tiara and heavily jeweled cope, Michelangelo thought how inscrutable were the ways of God. Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici had been in Florence when Julius died, so ill with ulcers he had had to be carried to Rome on a litter in order to cast his ballot. The College of Cardinals, sealed into the airless Sistine Chapel, had spent nearly a week battling between the forces of Leo Baglioni's Cardinal Riario and Cardinals Fiesco and Serra. The one member who had no enemies was Giovanni de' Medici. On the seventh day the College had unanimously settled on mild-mannered, modest, friendly Giovanni, fulfilling <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico's </i>plan when he had had Giovanni consecrated in the Badia Fiesolana at the age of sixteen.</p>

  <p class="normal">The trumpeters sounded for the beginning of the march across the city from St. Peter's, where Leo had been crowned in a pavilion in front of the wrecked Basilica, to St. John in Lateran, earliest home of the Popes. The Sant'Angelo bridge was covered with brilliant-hued draperies. At the beginning of the Via Papale, the Papal Way, the Florentine colony had erected a giant triumphal arch bearing the Medici emblems. Throngs lined streets covered with sprigs of myrtle and box.</p>

  <p class="normal">Riding between his cousin, Paolo Rucellai, and the Strozzi who had purchased his early Hercules, Michelangelo watched Leo, beaming with joy, raising his pearl-encrusted gloved hands in benediction, his chamberlains walking beside him throwing handfuls of gold coins to the crowds. Every house had brocades and velvets hung from its casements. The antique marbles of Rome lined the Via Papale: busts of the emperors, statues of the apostles, saints, the Virgin, placed side by side with pagan Greek sculptures.</p>

  <p class="normal">At midafternoon Pope Leo descended from his horse by means of a ladder, stood for a moment by the ancient bronze esquestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in front of the Lateran. Then, surrounded by his College of Cardinals, flanked by Cousin Giulio and the Florentine and Roman nobles, he entered the Lateran and seated himself on the Sella Stercoraria, ancient seat of power occupied by the first Popes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo ate little of the elaborate banquet served in the hall of the palace of Constantine, restored for the feast. At sunset he remounted his horse to follow in Pope Leo's train back to the Vatican. By the time they reached the Campo dei Fiori night had fallen. Torches and tapers lighted the streets. Michelangelo dropped off his horse at Leo Baglioni's house, handed the reins to a groom. Baglioni had not been invited to ride in the procession; he was alone in the house, unshaven, gloomy. This time he had been certain Cardinal Riario would be elected to the papacy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So you made it to the Vatican ahead of me!" he grumbled to Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'd be happy never to see the inside of the Papal palace again. I cede my place to you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is one game in which the winner can't cede. I'm out; you're in. There'll be glorious commissions."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have years of carving ahead for Julius' tomb."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was late when he returned to his new home which sat in a sea of centuries in the valley between the Capitoline and Quirinal hills, near the foot of Trajan's column where the Macello dei Corvi, Slaughterhouse of the Crows, dribbled into the crowded square. Just before his death Pope Julius had paid him two thousand ducats to settle the Sistine account and to commence carving the tomb marbles. With Gonfaloniere Soderini and the Signoria in exile from Florence, his commission to carve the Hercules for the front of the Signoria had vanished. When this property, consisting of a main building built of yellow firebrick, a shaded veranda along one side, a cluster of wooden sheds in the rear, a stable, tower and overgrown garden with shady laurel trees, had come on the market at a reasonably price, he had bought it and moved his marbles in. Trajan's market, a tiered, abandoned ruin rising just across from him, had once housed hundreds of merchants in separate stalls, attracting buyers from all over the world. Now the piazza was quiet, there were no shops, only a few small wooden houses remained in the shadow of the undomed church of Santa Maria di Loreto. During the day people passed through on their way to the Colonna palace or the Piazza del Quirinale on the one side, or to the Anibaldi palace and San Pietro in Vincoli on the other. At night it was as silent as though he were living deep in the <i class="calibre2">campagna.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">The house had two front doors, both facing the Macello dei Corvi, for it had formerly been rented as two separate apartments. His living quarters consisted of a good-sized bedroom facing the street, behind it a dining-sitting room, and behind that, feeding out to a garden pavilion, a low-ceilinged kitchen of the same yellow brick. In the second half of the house he had taken out the wall separating its two rooms, making himself as large a workshop as he had built in Florence. He bought a new iron bed for himself, woolen covers, a new mattress stuffed with wool, sent money to Buonarroto for fine Florentine bed sheets, tablecloths and towels which he kept with his store of shirts, handkerchiefs and blouses in a wardrobe standing next to his bed. He acquired a sorrel for traveling the rough cobbled streets of the city, ate his meals at a well-set table, went abroad in warm weather in a cape of black Florentine cloth lined with satin. Silvio Falconi was proving to be a good apprentice-servant.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the clapboard houses and stone tower at the rear of his garden were assistants helping with the tomb. Michele and Basso, two young stonemasons from Settignano; a foundling and promising draftsman who had asked permission to call himself Andrea di Michelangelo; Federigo Frizzi and Giovanni da Reggio, making models for the bronze frieze; Antonio from Pontassieve, who had agreed to bring his crew to Rome to shape and ornament the building blocks and columns. He felt easy about his future. Had not Pope Leo X announced to the courtiers about him: "Buonarroti and I were educated together under my father's roof"?</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first time since he had fled from Julius in April of 1505, eight years before, he was carving. Not one marble but three heroic columns, all at once. There was a natural rhythm between the movement of his breath and the movement of his hammer arm as he pounded the chisel across a cutting groove. This tactile joining with marble again made him swell with joy. He recalled the first lesson the Topolinos had taught him:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Stone works for you. It yields itself to skill and to love." He threw himself into the three blocks with passion yet with an inner calm and surety. The three white columns surrounded him in his workshop like snow-covered peaks. He desired intensely to breathe the same air his blocks did. He carved for fourteen hours a day, until his legs felt as though they were up in his body; yet he had only to leave the solid image before him, go to the door and gaze restfully into the void of sky to be refreshed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was plowing a straight furrow.</p>

  <p class="normal">Carving the Moses, mounds of white dust caked in his nostrils like tranquillity settling into the marrow of his bones; he felt a man of substance because his own three-dimensional force became fused with the three-dimensional stone. As a boy on the steps of the Duomo he had been unable to prove that sculpture was superior to painting as an art; here in his studio, moving smoothly from the Moses to the Dying Captive to the Heroic-Rebellious Captive, he could demonstrate the truth with irrefutable crystalline fact.</p>

  <p class="normal">Moses, holding the stone tablets under one arm, would be eight feet tall and massive even though seated. Yet what he was after was not an awareness of volume but of inner weight and structure. By pushing one leg sharply backward he set into action a dynamics of balance, creating a space-famine which was nourished by the monumentality of the right knee and calf, the outward thrust compensating for the vertigo caused by the withdrawn leg. His chisel hand flew unerringly to the point of entry in the four-foot-thick block: under the sharply pointed horizontal left elbow and corded forearm. He carved his line of flow through the wrist to the index finger pointing to the stone tablets under the opposite arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">At midnight he reluctantly took off his paper cap with its goat-tallow candle. There was no sound except the distant barking of dogs scavenging behind the Colonna kitchens. Moonlight splashed in through the rear garden window, enveloping the block with a transcendent light. He pulled up a bench and sat before the roughed-out mass, musing about Moses as a human being, a prophet, a leader of his people who had stood in the presence of God and been given the Law. The sculptor who did not have a philosophic mind created empty forms. What point was there in his knowing precisely where to enter the marble block if he did not know which Moses he intended to project? The meaning of his Moses, as much as the sculptural techniques, would determine its value. He knew where Moses sat in space; but where did he stand in time? Did he want to present the passionate angry Moses, returned from Mount Sinai to find his people worshiping the Golden Calf? Or the saddened, embittered Moses, fearing that he had arrived too late with the Law?</p>

  <p class="normal">As he sat drinking in the almost liquid flow of the issuing figure he understood that he must refuse to imprison Moses in time. He was seeking the universal Moses who knew the ways of man and God; the Lord's servant on earth, the voice of His conscience. The Moses who had been called up to the heights of Mount Sinai, had hidden his face because he dared not look upon the open sight of God, and received from Him the carved tablets of the Ten Commandments. The fierceness of soul which would burn outward through the cavernous depths of his eyes could not be motivated by despair, or the desire to punish. What had moved Moses was the passionate resolve that his people must not destroy themselves, that they must receive and obey the Commandments which God had sculptured on the stone tablets, and endure.</p>

  <p class="normal">His reverie was interrupted when the front door was unceremoniously thrown open by Balducci, who was advising him on the revision of the tomb contract. Pope Leo was using his good offices to persuade the Duke of Urbino and the other Rovere heirs to make the agreement more equitable for Michelangelo, to allow him more time and more money. Michelangelo glanced at his friend in amusement as he filled the doorway, for Balducci, who had been exactly Michelangelo's build when they first met on the streets of Rome in 1496, was now double Michelangelo's size in everything but the extremities of head and feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you get fat from making profits," Michelangelo teased, "or do the profits come from getting fat?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have to eat for you and for myself," boomed Balducci, patting his big stomach with both palms. "You're just as much a runt as you were when you tried to play football against Doni in Piazza Santa Croce. Have they agreed to the new terms?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They've raised the price to sixteen thousand, five hundred ducats. Seven years to complete, more if I should need it..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let me see the plans for the new tomb."</p>

  <p class="normal">Reluctantly, Michelangelo dug a batch of papers out of a stained parchment folio. Balducci cried disapprovingly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You told me you were reducing the size!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"So I have. Look here, the front side is a half less in length. I no longer have to build a walk-in chamber..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Balducci had been counting on the sheets.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How many statues are there?"</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"In toto? </span></i><span>Forty-one."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"What are their sizes?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"From life size to twice normal."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How many do you intend to carve yourself?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perhaps twenty-five. All but the angels, <i class="calibre2">putti...</i>"</p>

  <p class="normal">Even in the flickering light of the single candle Michelangelo could see Balducci's face turn purple.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're <i class="calibre2">pazzo!" </i>he cried. "All you've reduced is the structural framework which you weren't going to build anyway. It was bad enough that you didn't listen to Jacopo Galli eight years ago, but you were younger then. What conceivable excuse can you have for contracting a second time to do the impossible?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Julius' executors won't settle for less. Besides, I'm getting nearly the price and the time allowance Galli wanted for me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelagnolo," said Balducci softly, "I can't take Jacopo Galli's place as a man of culture, but he respected my talents sufficiently to make me manager of his bank. This is stupid business. Twenty-five giant figures must take you twenty-five years. Even if you live that long, do you want to be chained to this mausoleum for the rest of your days? You'll be more of a slave than these Captives you're blocking out."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have a good <i class="calibre2">bottega </i>now. Once the new contract is signed I'll bring more stonemasons from Settignano. I have so many of these figures already carved in my mind, not to bring them to life would be a cruel waste. Watch, and you will see marble flying around here like coveys of white doves in the spring."</p>

  <p class="chapter">2.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Sistine ceiling had produced an effect equal to the unveiling of the David in Florence. From artists of every medium who had flocked to Rome from all over Europe to help Leo celebrate his elevation to the papacy, Michelangelo had rewon the painting title first earned by the Bathers: "Master of the World." Only the group centered around Raphael continued to fight the vault, calling it anatomy rather than artistry, carnal, exaggerated, overwrought. But they were hampered now, for Bramante was no longer art emperor of Rome. Cracks of such serious dimension had shown in his piers of St. Peter's that all work had been stopped and extensive studies undertaken to see if the foundations could be saved. Pope Leo had been too kind to remove Bramante officially as architect; but work on the Belvedere above the Vatican was also in abeyance. Bramante's hands had become so crippled with palsy that he had been obliged to turn over the drawing of his plans to Antonio da Sangallo, nephew of Michelangelo's friend and architectural teacher, Giuliano da Sangallo. Over Bramante's house there now hung the slight odor of decay that had settled over Sangallo's the day Bramante won the prize for his design for St. Peter's.</p>

  <p class="normal">One dusk Michelangelo answered a knock on his door, impatient with any intrusion. He found himself gazing into the amiable hazel eyes of a young man in an orange silk cloak, with a fair complexion and blond hair that brought Granacci to his mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Master Buonarroti, I am Sebastiano Luciani of Venice. I have come to confess..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am not a priest."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...that I have been a simpleton and idiot. This knock, these words, are the first time my hand or tongue have made sense since I arrived in Rome. I brought my lute so that I could accompany myself while I tell you my bathetic story."</p>

  <p class="normal">Amused by the Venetian's infectiously light manner, Michelangelo bowed him in. Sebastiano perched on the highest stool in the room and ran his fingers across the strings of the lute.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sing and everything passes," he murmured.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo dropped into the one padded chair in the workroom, sat with his legs stretched out stiffly before him, hands behind his head. Sebastiano sang a scanned improvisation of how he had been brought to Rome by the banker Chigi to paint his villa, had joined in the idolizing of Raphael by proclaiming that Raphael's brush was "in attune with the techniques of painting, pleasing in color, ingenious in invention, charming in all its expressions and designed like an angel," Buonarroti? "Admittedly he can draw, but his colorings? Monotonous! His figures? Bumpy anatomy. His scenes? Without grace..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have heard these charges before," interrupted Michelangelo. "They weary me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"As well they might! But Rome shall hear this dirge no more from me. From now on I sing the praises of Master Buonarroti."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What has brought this change of heart?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The eclectic Raphael! He has picked my bones. Absorbed all I learned from Bellini and Giorgione, so that now he is a better Venetian painter than I! And so humbly thanking me for teaching him!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Raphael borrows only from the best. He does it well. Why are you abandoning him?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now that he has become a magic Venetian colorist he is getting more commissions than ever. While I... I get nothing. Raphael has swallowed me, all except my eyes, which have been feasting on your Sistine ceiling these past days."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sebastiano lowered his head over his lute, heels locked in the top rung of the stool. His voice filled the room with a robust gondolier's song. Michelangelo studied the Venetian before him, wondering why he had really come.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sebastiano dropped in often for music and talk. An inveterate pursuer of pleasure and pretty girls, he needed money for the hunt. He was living on portraits while longing for one of the big commissions that brought a steady income. His draftsmanship was weak, he had no sense of invention. But he was loquacious, full of fun, refusing to be serious even about the illegitimate son who had just been born to him. Michelangelo continued to work while half listening to the amusing chatter.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My dear <i class="calibre2">compare, </i>godfather," said Sebastiano, "don't you get mixed up, carving three blocks all at once? How do you remember what you want to do with each of them when you move from figure to figure?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo chuckled. "I wish I could have all twenty-five blocks standing around in a great circle. I would move from one to the other so fast that in five years I'd have all of them completed. Have you any concept of how thoroughly you can hollow out blocks of marble by thinking about them for eight years? Ideas are sharper than chisels."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I could be a great painter," said Sebastiano in a flat tone. "I have all the techniques. Put a painting in front of me, and I'll copy it so exactly you'll never recognize it from the original. But how do you get the idea in the first place?"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a wail, almost of anguish, one of the few times Michelangelo had seen Sebastiano serious. He ruminated while chiseling out the two Tablets of the Law.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perhaps ideas are a natural function of the mind, as breathing is of the lungs? Perhaps God puts them there? If I knew the origin of men's ideas, I would have solved one of our deepest mysteries."</p>

  <p class="normal">He moved upward to Moses' wrist and hand resting on top of the tablets, the fingers leading into the long-flowing, waist-length beard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sebastiano, I'm going to make some drawings for you. Your use of color and shadow is as fine as Raphael's, your figures are lyrical. Since he has borrowed your Venetian palette, why should you not borrow my designs? Let's see if we can't supplant Raphael."</p>

  <p class="normal">He enjoyed sketching at night after a full day of carving, thinking up new variations on old religious themes. He introduced Sebastiano to Pope Leo, showed the pontiff scenes from the life of Christ beautifully transformed by Sebastiano. Leo, who cherished all musical entertainers, made him welcome at the Vatican.</p>

  <p class="normal">Late one night Sebastiano burst in crying, "Have you heard the news? A new rival to Raphael has arisen! The best of the Venetians, equal to Bellini and Giorgione. Paints with the charm and grace of Raphael! But is a stronger, more imaginative draftsman."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Congratulations!" said Michelangelo with a wry grin.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Sebastiano was given the fresco commission for San Pietro in Montorio, he worked hard to bring Michelangelo's designs to glowing life in his cartoons. Rome assumed that, as part of Michelangelo's <i class="calibre2">bottega, </i>Sebastiano was learning to draw with his master's hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only Contessina, newly arrived in Rome with her family, thought there was something more involved. She had spent two years of evenings sitting by Michelangelo's side watching him draw; she knew his calligraphy. When he attended her elaborate dinner for the Pope and his court, for Contessina was determined to become Leo's official hostess, she took him into a small study that was so faithful a replica of Lorenzo's <i class="calibre2">studiolo </i>with its wood paneling and fireplace, cases of cameos and amulets that it brought nostalgic tears to his eyes. She gazed at him head on, her dark eyes flashing, demanded:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why do you allow Sebastiano to parade your work as his?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It does no harm."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Raphael has already lost an important commission to Sebastiano."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a godsend to the overworked, harried man."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why should you stoop to a hoax like this?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned her gaze, thinking how much she was still the Contessina, Little Countess, of their youth; but at the same time how greatly she had changed since the election of her brother to the papacy. Now she was the Big Countess, brooking no interference from her two elder sisters Lucrezia Salviati and Maddalena Cibo, who had also moved their families to Rome. Contessina fought for papal appointments, benefices for the members of the Ridolfi family, working hand in glove with Cousin Giulio, who was in control of the business and politics of the Vatican. In her spacious gardens she had had a stage built on which were performed plays and musicals for the nobility of the Church and city-states. More and more the laity of the Christian world wanting favors and appointments were coming to Contessina. This grasping for power and the wielding of it was understandable, Michelangelo thought, after the years of exile and poverty; but it had made a change in Contessina which left him uncomfortable.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Since I finished the Sistine," explained Michelangelo, "certain people have been saying, 'Raphael has grace, Michelangelo has only stamina.' And since I will not stoop to fight the Raphael clique for my position, I find it amusing to have a talented young painter do it for me. Without getting myself involved, Rome is beginning to say, 'Raphael has charm, but Michelangelo has profundity.' Isn't it amusing that fun-loving Sebastiano could have accomplished this transition by improvising verses of praise to my vault, accompanying himself on the lute?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina clenched her fists at the irony in his voice. "It is not amusing! I am the Countess of Rome today. I can protect you... officially... with dignity. I can bring your detractors to their knees. That is the way...."</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached forward, took her two tightly clenched fists between his stonehewer's hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, Contessina, it is not the way. Trust me. I am happy now, and working well."</p>

  <p class="normal">In place of the anger came the lightninglike, radiant smile he remembered from their childhood clashes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Very well, but if you do not come to my parties I shall expose you and Sebastiano as a couple of humbugs."</p>

  <p class="normal">He laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who ever got the better of a Medici?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Without thinking he placed his hands on the puffed shoulders of her silk gown, drew her close, searching for the fragrance of mimosa. She started to tremble. Her eyes grew enormous. Time dissolved: the <i class="calibre2">studiolo </i>in the Via Ripetta in Rome became the <i class="calibre2">studiolo </i>in the Medici palace in Florence. They were not the great countess and the great artist, with half of their years already gone; but for a fleeting instant, at the threshold of life.</p>

  <p class="chapter">3.</p>

  <p class="normal">Swiss guards in green, white and yellow arrived at his house early in the morning with what amounted to a <i class="calibre2">breve </i>from Pope Leo to dine at the Vatican palace that day. It was a hardship to walk away from his work, but he had learned that one did not ignore the summons of a Pope. Silvio laid fresh linens over his arm, Michelangelo went to the baths of the Via de' Pastini, soaked the caked dust out of his pores, and arrived at the Vatican at eleven.</p>

  <p class="normal">He began to realize why the Romans were complaining that "Rome has sunk to a Florentine colony," for the Vatican was filled with triumphant Tuscans. Moving through the throng of more than a hundred dinner guests assembled in the two throne rooms, he recognized Pietro Bembo, the Vatican Secretary of State and humanist-poet; the poet Ariosto, who was writing his <i class="calibre2">Orlando Furioso; </i>the neo-Latinist Sannazaro; Guicciardini, the historian; Vida, author of the <i class="calibre2">Christiad; </i>Giovanni Rucellai, writing one of the first blank-verse tragedies, <i class="calibre2">Rosmunda; </i>Fracastoro, physician-author; Tommaso Inghirami, diplomat, librarian, classicist and improviser of Latin verses; Raphael, now painting the Stanza d'Eliodoro in the Papal palace, and occupying a place of honor just below Pope Leo; the woodcarver Giovanni Barile of Siena, who was decorating the doors and shutters of the palace with Medici emblems. Michelangelo spied Sebastiano and was pleased that his protégé had been invited.</p>

  <p class="normal">Having bought back from the Republic of Florence most of his father's great library, Leo had experts searching the world for important manuscripts. He had also brought to Rome Lascaris, his father's Greek manuscript hunter, to edit and print the jewels of Greek literature. The Pope was also in process of reorganizing the Roman Academy for classical studies, which had been neglected by Julius, and was giving new hope of learning to the University of Rome. Michelangelo heard this new court of Leo's described as "the most brilliant and cultured since Imperial Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">Throughout the long sumptuous dinner, of which the Pope could eat little because he suffered from bad digestion and gaseous disturbances, Leo waved his white, bejeweled, plump hands while he accompanied Gabriel Marin of the remarkably beautiful voice, the master violinist Marone of Brescia, and Raffaelle Lippus, the blind balladier. Between the musical performances buffoons kept Leo amused. His court jester, <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico's </i>former barber, had a fund of anatomical witticisms which he unleashed between bouts of eating forty eggs in a row, and then twenty capons, while nearsighted Leo gazed at him through his magnifying glass, emitting peals of laughter at the gargantuan gorging.</p>

  <p class="normal">The four-hour dinner seemed endless to Michelangelo. He was incapable of absorbing but the most modest amount of salted trout, roast capon, sweet rice cooked in milk of almonds. He writhed in his seat over the many wasted hours, wondering how soon he would be released. For Pope Leo the dinner was but a preliminary to an afternoon and night of pleasure. Now came some of Italy's finest poets to read their new verses, then a ballet, then a masque, then another buffoonery at the expense of Camillo Querno, called the Arch-Poet, who read from an atrocious epic poem while Leo crowned him with cabbage leaves. The entertainments would continue until Leo could no longer keep his eyes open.</p>

  <p class="normal">Walking home through the dark and deserted streets, Michelangelo recalled Leo's line to Giulio immediately after his coronation:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Since God has seen fit to give us the papacy, let us enjoy it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Italy was more peaceful than it had been for a number of pontificates. True, money was pouring out of the Vatican at an unprecedented rate; several times that day Michelangelo had seen the delighted Leo fling purses containing several hundred florins to singers and performers, which had caused one of his sober neighbors to comment:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope could no more save a thousand ducats than a stone could fly up into the sky."</p>

  <p class="normal">Leo was going to need money: millions upon millions of ducats, an even more incredible fortune for the pleasures and the arts than Julius had needed for war. When he begged Cardinal Pucci, in charge of the Vatican's resources, to be sure that nothing was done that would bring dishonor on the Church, no simony, no sale of cardinalates or benefices, the cardinal shrugged and said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, you have assigned to me the task of financing this worldwide business. My first obligation is to keep it solvent."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo reached the Macello dei Corvi as the midnight chimes rang out. He changed into his work clothes, so thick with the accumulation of stone dust and impregnation of sweat from the hot summer sun they had become an extra layer of his own skin. With a sigh of relief he picked up hammer and chisel, juggled them in both hands to feel their accustomed weight. He determined grimly that this was the last time he would be persuaded to waste an entire day. His sympathies went to pale, puffy-faced Raphael, who was summoned at all hours of the night and day for the most trivial of the Pope's errands, to give an opinion of an illuminated manuscript or design a wall decoration for Leo's new bath chamber. Raphael was always polite, interested, though forced to waste his work hours and to go without sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was not for him. He was not a charming man. He would be eternally damned if he ever became one!</p>

  <p class="normal">He could lock out Rome, but the world of Italy was now the world of the Medici, and he was too closely allied to the family to escape. Defeat overcame Giuliano, the only one of <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico's </i>sons he loved. Letters from the family and Granacci told of how magnificently Giuliano was governing Florence: abstemious, gentle, warmhearted, walking the streets unaccompanied, opening the Medici palace to scholar and artist, reviving the Plato Academy, leaving the administration of government and justice in the hands of the elected councils. But these qualities did not appeal to Cousin Giulio or to Pope Leo. Leo recalled his brother from Florence, and now in September Michelangelo was dressing to go to the ceremony in which Giuliano was to be made a Baron of Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">The ceremony took place on the ancient Capitoline, just above Michelangelo's house. He sat with the Medici family: Contessina and Ridolfi with their three sons, Niccolò now twelve, and to be named a cardinal on achieving sixteen; the older sisters, Maddalena Cibo, with her husband and five children, including Innocenzo, also to he made a cardinal, and Lucrezia Salviati with her numerous family, and her son Giovanni, in line for a cardinalate. Leo had had a stage built over the ruins where Sangallo had taken Michelangelo sketching to re-create the glories of ancient Rome. The jagged earthen piazza had been covered by a wooden floor and hundreds of seats. Michelangelo listened to speeches of welcome to Giuliano from the heads of the Roman Senate, epic poems in Latin, a series of masques and satires in the Florentine tradition, watched as a woman wrapped in cloth of gold, personifying Rome, was carried to Giuliano's throne to thank him for condescending to become commander of the city. After a bawdy comedy by Plautus, Pope Leo bestowed privileges on Rome, such as a reduction of the salt tax, to the thunderous applause of thousands of Romans thronging the bare hillsides. Then began a six-hour banquet with a profusion of dishes not seen in Rome since the days of Caligula and Nero.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the end of the orgy Michelangelo made his way down the Capitoline through the throng that was being fed from the leftovers of the Saturnalia above, and locked both street doors of his house behind him. Neither he nor Giuliano nor Rome had been fooled by this performance, which was designed to conceal the fact that scholarly Giuliano, who loved the Republic of Florence, had been replaced by Lorenzo, twenty-one-year-old son of Piero and the ambitious Alfonsina. Young Lorenzo had been sent to Tuscany with a letter of instructions formulated by Giulio telling him how to control elections, appoint his own Council, absorb the functions of government.</p>

  <p class="normal">Giulio's power as the figure behind the Pope was growing. A commission appointed by Leo had declared Giulio of legitimate birth, on the grounds that <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico's </i>brother had agreed to marry Giulio's mother, and that only his murder in the cathedral had kept the marriage from taking place. Now that he was legitimate, Giulio was appointed a cardinal; he would have the official power to rule the Church and the Papal States.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor was Leo's and Giulio's desire to extend the Medici control throughout Italy remote from Michelangelo's affairs. They had been trying to drive the Duke of Urbino, a Rovere nephew and heir of Pope Julius, out of his dukedom. Today Pope Leo had deposed the duke as standard-bearer of the Church, in favor of Giuliano. Ultimately Leo would seize his lands. The Duke of Urbino, a violent man, was the one to whom Michelangelo would be responsible for Julius' tomb. The war that had been brought into the open between the Medici and the Roveres could mean nothing but trouble for the Buonarroti.</p>

  <p class="normal">Over the mild winter he secured a reprieve from Contessina's receptions by bringing her to the workshop to see his three emerging figures; and from Leo's entertainments by a series of excuses which amused Leo sufficiently to grant him the high favor of abstinence. His only associates during the long productive work weeks were his assistants in the garden, his solitary diversion an occasional supper with a group of amiable young Florentines whose friendship was based on a nostalgic longing to be within sight of the Duomo. Only once did he break his fast: when Giuliano came to the studio to urge him to attend a reception for Leonardo da Vinci, whom Giuliano had invited to Rome and installed in the Belvedere.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You, Leonardo and Raphael are the great masters of Italy today," said Giuliano in his quiet way. "I should like the three of you to be friends, perhaps work together...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll come to your reception, Giuliano, of course," said Michelangelo. "But as for working together... We are as different species as are birds, fish and fowl."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Strange," murmured Giuliano, "I should have thought that all artists would be brothers. Come early. I'd like to show you some of the experiments in alchemy Leonardo is conducting for me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Entering the Belvedere the next day, Giuliano took him through a series of workrooms extensively renovated for Leonardo's purposes: windows made taller to give higher light, the kitchen built to take care of boiling alchemy pots, a paved terrace overlooking the valley, Papal palace and Sistine, furniture built by the Vatican carpenters, trestle tables, stands for mixing paints. Giuliano had persuaded Pope Leo to give Leonardo a painting commission, but as Michelangelo was led through the workshops, including that of a German ironmonger who was to help Leonardo with his mechanical inventions, he saw that Leonardo had not yet begun to work at his art.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Look at these concave mirrors," exclaimed Giuliano, "this metal screw-cutting machine, all new. When I took him out on the Pontine marshes he located several extinct volcanoes, and sketched plans for draining the fever-laden area. He won't let anyone see his notebooks, but I suspect he's completing his mathematical studies for the squaring of curved surfaces. His work on optics, his formulations of the laws of botany—amazing! Leonardo feels he will be able to tell the age of trees by counting the rings on the trunk. Imagine!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I would rather imagine him painting beautiful frescoes."</p>

  <p class="normal">Giuliano led him back toward the drawing room.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leonardo is a universal man. Has there been such a scientific mind since Aristotle? I think not. Art he conceives as only one aspect of human creativity."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is beyond my comprehension," growled Michelangelo stubbornly. "When a man has such a rare gift he should not spend his days counting the rings on trees."</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo emerged, followed by his lifetime companion, the still exquisite and youthful Salai, dressed in an elaborate red blouse with lacy sleeves. Leonardo himself, Michelangelo thought, looked tired and old, his magnificent flowing beard and shoulder-length hair now white. The two men, who understood each other not at all, exchanged expressions of pleasure at the reunion. Leonardo in his high-pitched voice told Michelangelo of the time he had spent studying the Sistine ceiling.</p>

  <p class="normal">"After analyzing your work I have written corrections to my treatise on painting. You have proved that the study of anatomy is extremely important and useful to the artist." His voice became impersonal. "But I also see a grave danger there."</p>

  <p class="normal">Nettled, Michelangelo asked, "Of what kind?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of exaggeration. The painter, after he studies your vault, must take care not to become wooden through too strong an emphasis on bone, muscles and sinews; nor to become too enamored of naked figures which display all their feelings."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And you think that mine do?" Michelangelo's gorge was rising.</p>

  <p class="normal">"On the contrary, yours are close to perfection. But what of the painter who tries to go beyond you? If your use of anatomy makes the Sistine so good, then he must use even more anatomy in order to be better."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I cannot hold myself responsible for later exaggerations."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nor are you, except that you have brought anatomical painting to its outside limits. There is no margin for others to perfect. Consequently, they will distort. Observers will say, 'It is Michelangelo's fault; without him we could have refined and improved anatomical painting for hundreds of years.' Alas, you have started it, and you have ended it, on one ceiling."</p>

  <p class="normal">Other guests began to arrive. Soon there was a hubbub in the rooms. Michelangelo stood alone at a side window overlooking the Sistine, not knowing whether he was perplexed or hurt. Leonardo was astonishing the guests with new contrivances: animals filled with air which sailed over everyone's head; a live lizard to which he had attached wings filled with quicksilver, and whose head he had decorated with artificial eyes, horns and a beard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The mechanical lion I made in Milan could walk several steps," he announced to the guests who were congratulating him on his inventiveness. "And when you pressed a button his breast fell open, exposing a bunch of lilies."</p>

  <p class="normal">To himself Michelangelo muttered, <i class="calibre2">"Questo è il colmo! </i>This is the limit!" and rushed home, trembling to get the substantive feel of marble between his hands.</p>

  <p class="chapter">4.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the spring Bramante died. Pope Leo ordered an elaborate funeral for him at which artists spoke of the beauty of his Tempietto, the Cortile of the Belvedere, the Castellesi palace. Pope Leo then sent for Giuliano da Sangallo, his father's favorite architect. Sangallo arrived; his former palace on the Via Alessandrina was returned to him. Michelangelo was there within a matter of minutes to embrace his old friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We meet again!" cried Sangallo, joy shining in his eyes. "I survived dismissal, you the years in the Sistine vault." He paused, knit his brows. "But I found a strange communication from Pope Leo. He asks if I mind making Raphael my assistant at St. Peter's. Is Raphael an architect?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt an involuntary twinge. Raphael!</p>

  <p class="normal">"He has been directing the repairs at St. Peter's, and is seen on the scaffolding at all hours."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But it is you who should take over my work. After all, I am nearly seventy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, <i class="calibre2">caro; </i>let Raphael help you. It gives me freedom with the marbles."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Leo borrowed heavily from the Florentine bankers Gaddi, Strozzi and Ricasoli for the continuation of St. Peter's. Sangallo resumed the building.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo allowed few visitors to his studio: former Gonfaloniere Soderini and his wife, Monna Argentina, who had been forgiven by Pope Leo and permitted to live in Rome; three men who offered him his first private commission since Taddeo Taddei had requested the circular Our Lady. Metello Vari dei Porcari, a Roman of ancient blood, and Bernardo Cencio, a canon of St. Peter's, said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"We would like you to do a Risen Christ for us. For the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am pleased to have the request," declared Michelangelo; "but I must tell you that my contract with Pope Julius' executors does not permit me to take commissions...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"This would be a single piece, sculptured at your leisure," exclaimed Mario Scappucci.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A Christ Risen?" Michelangelo was intrigued by the idea. "Beyond the Crucifixion? How do you envisage the piece?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Life size. With a cross in his arms. In an attitude that will be determined by you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could I think about it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He had long felt that most Crucifixions did a grave injustice to Jesus, portraying him as crushed and defeated by the weight of the cross. He had never believed that for a single instant: his Christ was a powerful male who had carried the cross on the road to Calvary as though it were the branch of an olive tree. He began to draw. The cross became but a puny thing in Jesus' grasp. Since his commissioners had reversed tradition by asking for a cross after the Resurrection, why could he too not depart from the accepted concept? Instead of the cross crushing Christ, Jesus would stand triumphant. The first rough sketches crosshatched, he gazed intently at his drawing. Where had he seen this Christ before? Then he remembered: it was the figure of a stonemason he had drawn for Ghirlandaio in the first year of his apprenticeship.</p>

  <p class="normal">Though he managed to keep the peace in Rome, his family in Florence kept his cup of anxiety overflowing. Exhausted by Buonarroto's badgering for money to open his own wool shop, Michelangelo took a thousand ducats from the funds provided by his new Rovere contract and had Balducci send them to Florence. Buonarroto and Giovansimone opened their shop, promptly running into trouble. They needed more capital. Couldn't Michelangelo send them another thousand? He would soon be earning a profit on his money.... In the meanwhile, Buonarroto had found a girl he would not mind marrying, her father having promised a sizable dowry. Did Michelangelo think he should marry her?</p>

  <p class="normal">He sent Buonarroto two hundred ducats, which Buonarroto never acknowledged. What had happened to them? For that matter what had happened to the money Lodovico took from Michelangelo's account and had promised to return? What about his funds on deposit at Santa Maria Nuova hospital; why did the <i class="calibre2">spedalingo </i>delay in paying out the money as Michelangelo demanded? What was the good of owning five farms if the share tenants were stealing him blind?</p>

  <p class="normal">A severe blow was word from Buonarroto that Mother Topolino had died. He put aside his work and walked to San Lorenzo in Damaso to say a prayer for the repose of her soul. He sent money to Buonarroto with instructions to ride up to the church in Settignano and have the priest say a mass for her there.</p>

  <p class="normal">He locked the gates of his mind, as he had locked the gates of the garden. Working the marble was not only a delight, it was a consolation. How rarely a good piece of marble went bad! He spent the ducats advanced to him by the Roveres, hiring additional crews of master carvers, bronze casters, carpenters, all crowding his yard from dawn to dark, building the architectural base and the front façade while he sketched steadily to complete the drawings for the remaining sculptures, turning the Settignano <i class="calibre2">pietra serena </i>masons into marble <i class="calibre2">scultori </i>who could mass a dozen giant blocks so that he could get to the carving of the Victories.</p>

  <p class="normal">The months passed. His apprentices brought him the local gossip. Leonardo da Vinci had fallen into serious trouble, spending so much time experimenting with new oils and varnishes for preserving the work that he failed to do any painting on Leo's commission. The Pope had cried mockingly at court:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leonardo will never do anything, for he commences by thinking about the end before the beginning of the work."</p>

  <p class="normal">The courtiers spread the jest. Leonardo, learning that he had become an object of ridicule, abandoned Leo's commission. The Pope heard through informers that Leonardo was dissecting in the hospital of Santo Spirito, and threatened to drive him out of Rome. Leonardo, fleeing the Belvedere to continue his studies in the marshes, came down with malaria. When he recovered he found that his ironmonger had destroyed his mechanical experiments. When his protector, Giuliano, left at the head of the papal troops to drive the invading French out of Lombardy, Leonardo could no longer remain in Rome. Where to go? France, perhaps. He had been invited there years before....</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo too was stricken, with such a severe case of gallstones that he could do no work at all. For weeks he was bedridden, his eyeballs becoming mustard yellow, his strength ebbing. He was carried back to Florence on a litter. His repatriation had come too late.</p>

  <p class="normal">Raphael became the architect of St. Peter's, and of Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo received an urgent note from Contessina. He hurried to the palace, was received by her son Niccolò, taken upstairs to her bedroom. Though the weather was warm, Contessina was covered by several quilts, her pale face lying exhausted on the pillows, her eyes cavernous.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Contessina, you are ill."</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina beckoned him to her bed, patted a place for him to sit. He took her hand, white and fragile, in his own. She closed her eyes. When she opened them again there were tears moistening the warm brown pupils.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelagnolo, I remember the first time we met. In the sculpture garden. I asked, 'Why do you work so furiously? Doesn't it exhaust you?'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"And I answered, 'Cutting stone does not take strength out of you, it puts it back in.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Everyone thought I was soon to die, as my mother and sister had.... You put strength in me, <i class="calibre2">caro."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"You said, 'When I am near you, I feel strong.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"And you answered, 'When I am near you, I feel confused.'" She smiled. "Giovanni said you frightened him. You never frightened me. I saw how tender you were, under the surface."</p>

  <p class="normal">They stared at each other. Contessina whispered:</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have never spoken of our feelings."</p>

  <p class="normal">He ran his fingers gently over her cheek.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I loved you, Contessina."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I loved you, Michelangelo. I have always felt your presence in the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">Her eyes lighted for a brief instant.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My sons will be your friends...."</p>

  <p class="normal">She was seized with a coughing spell that shook the big bed. As she turned her head away from him, raised a handkerchief to her lips, he saw the red stain. His mind flashed back to Jacopo Galli. This would be the last time he would see Contessina.</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited, gulping the salt of unshed tears. She refused to turn her head back to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He whispered, <i class="calibre2">"Addio, mia cara," </i>wheeled silently, left the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">The death of Contessina shook him deeply. He concentrated on the head of the Moses, striving to bring it to a state of completion: upward through the beard to the intense, full lower lip, the mouth so expressive that a sound might emerge at any moment; to the sharply protruding nose, the passionate outburst of expression in the forehead, the creased muscles about the cheekbone, and finally, to the eyes set deeply in the head, creating dark accents to contrast with the highlights he would file onto the bone and flesh structure of the face.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he turned to the exquisitely sensitive, agonized figures of the two Captives, one resisting death, one yielding, pouring into their flesh his own grief and sense of loss. He had known that there could never be a life together for Contessina and himself. But he too had always been aware of her presence, had been nourished and gladdened by it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Laying aside his hammer and chisel, he made models for the bronze frieze, bought twenty thousand pounds of brass, summoned additional stonecutters from Settignano, speeded up the work of the Pontassieve crew in squaring and decorating the structural stones, wrote a barrage of letters to Florence to locate a marble expert who could go to Carrara and buy him more blocks. He had all the ingredients for a sustained drive to complete in another year the all-important front wall, the Moses and Captives mounted in place, Victories installed in the niches, the bronze frieze set above the first floor. He would work like a man possessed; but since he was to be possessed by marble, it seemed good and natural.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Leo had been determined to reign without war, but that did not mean he could avoid the incessant attempts on the part of his neighbors to conquer the rich country; nor the internecine strife which had been the city-states' history. Giuliano had not been able to subdue the French in Lombardy. He had been taken ill in the attempt, and moved to the monastery of the Badia at Fiesole where, it was rumored, he was dying, even as had Contessina.... The Duke of Urbino had not only refused to help the papal army but had become an ally of the French. Pope Leo himself rushed north to make a treaty with the French, which left him free to attack the Duke of Urbino.</p>

  <p class="normal">Immediately on his return to Rome he summoned Michelangelo to the Vatican. Leo had been kind to the Buonarroti family while in Florence, naming them counts palatine, a high honor on the road to nobility, and granting them the right to display the Medici crest of six balls.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leo, sitting at a table in his library with Giulio, was examining through his spyglass a number of gems and carved cameos he had brought back from Florence. His travels seemed to have done him good, for he had lost some of his flatulence, there was color in his usually chalk-white cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, you were most generous to my family."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not at all," said Leo. "It is many years now that you have been of our house."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am grateful, Holiness."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good," said Leo, laying aside the spyglass. Giulio also came to attention. "Because we do not want you, a Medici sculptor, spending your time creating statues for a Rovere."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But the contract! I am obliged..."</p>

  <p class="normal">A silence fell. Leo and Giulio looked at each other for an instant.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have decided to present you with the greatest art commission of our age," cried the Pope. "We wish you to undertake a façade for our family church, San Lorenzo... as my father thought of it... a glorious façade..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood staring sightlessly out the window, over the chaotic jumble of tawny rooftops. He heard the Pope speaking behind him though he could not discern the words. He forced himself back to the table.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But, Holy Father, the tomb for Pope Julius! You recall the contract signed only three years ago. I must finish what I have contracted for, or the Roveres will prosecute me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Enough time has been given to the Roveres." Giulio's manner was abrupt. "The Duke of Urbino made a treaty to help the French against us. He was partly responsible for the loss of Milan."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm sorry. I did not know...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now you do!" Cardinal Giulio's dark, sharp-featured face became less grim. "A Medici artist should serve the Medici."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And so it shall be," replied Michelangelo, also relaxing. "Within two years the tomb will be complete. I have everything organized..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No!" Leo's round face was flushed with anger, a rare and frightening sight. "There will be no two years for the Roveres. You will enter our service at once."</p>

  <p class="normal">His manner quieted.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now, Michelangelo. We are your friends. We will protect you against the Roveres, secure a new contract which will give you more time and money. When you have completed the façade for San Lorenzo you can return to Julius' mausoleum...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, I have lived with this tomb for ten long years. I have every inch of its twenty-five figures carved in my mind. We are ready to construct the front wall, cast the bronzes, mount my three big statues..." His voice had been rising; he was shouting now. "You must not stop me. It is a crucial moment for me. I have trained workmen. If I have to dismiss the men, leave the marbles lying about... Holiness, on the love I bore your noble father, I implore you not to do this terrible thing to me...."</p>

  <p class="normal">He dropped on one knee before the Pope, bowed his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Give me time to finish the work that is planned. Then I can move to Florence and to the façade in peace and happiness. I will create a great façade for San Lorenzo, but I must not be tormented in mind and spirit..."</p>

  <p class="normal">His only answer was a crosshatched silence in which Leo and Giulio, from a lifetime of communication, were expressing to each other by the look in their eyes what they thought of this difficult artist bowed before them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo," said Pope Leo, shaking his head, "you still take everything so... so... desperately."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Or is it," asked Giulio, "that you do not wish to create the San Lorenzo façade for the Medici?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I do, Your Grace. But it is a huge undertaking...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are right!" cried Leo. "You must leave for Carrara at once, choose the blocks yourself, supervise the cutting. I will have Jacopo Salviati in Florence send you a thousand florins to pay for them."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo kissed the Pope's ring, left Leo's presence, descended the steps of the Vatican palace with the tears streaming down his face. Courtiers, prelates, ambassadors, merchants, entertainers thronging up the stairs to begin their day of merriment, gazed at him in amazement. He did not know that they saw, nor did he care.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night, lonely, miserable, he found himself walking in the quarter where Balducci had searched among the prostitutes. Coming toward him was a young girl, slender, her blond hair plucked back to give her a high brow, dressed in a semi-transparent blouse, a string of heavy baubles about her neck causing a deep declivity between her breasts. For a startling instant he thought he caught an image of Clarissa. It passed quickly, for the girl's features were coarse, her movements angular; but even this fleeting memory of Clarissa had been sufficient to awaken his longing.</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Buona sera. Vuoi venire con me? </span></i><span>Would you like to come with me?"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know."</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Sembri triste. </span></i><span>You seem sad."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"I am. Can you cure that malady?"</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"È mio mestiere. </span></i><span>That is my trade."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"I will come."</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Non te ne pentirai. </span></i><span>You won't regret it."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">But he did, within forty-eight hours. Balducci listened to the description of his symptoms, cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You've caught the French sickness. Why didn't you tell me you wanted a girl?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I didn't know I wanted one...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Idiot! There's an epidemic in Rome. Let me summon my doctor."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I contracted this by myself. I'll cure it by myself."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not without mercury ointment and sulphur baths, you won't. It sounds like a light case, you might be able to cure it quickly."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have to, Balducci. Carrara is a rough life."</p>

  <p class="chapter">5.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Apuan Alps loomed like a dark wall beyond his window. He slipped into his shirt, stockings and hobnail boots for the climb, left his apartment at the rear of the apothecary Pelliccia's house, went down the courtyard steps and into the Piazza del Duomo where an agent and quarry owner slipped past him in the darkness, the shawls over their shoulders tied at the waist. On the wooden bridge over the piazza two priests crossed from the sacristy to the choir loft of the cathedral for early mass. Carrara was asleep inside its horseshoe-shaped walls, the semicircle of stone closed toward the sea, open on the steep mountain side. He had not wanted to leave Rome, but being at the heart of his source material assuaged the pain.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tucking his dinner of bread under one arm, he walked up a narrow street to the Porta del Bozzo, remembering the proud line of the inhabitants that "Carrara is the only town in the world that can afford to cobble its squares with marble." In the ash-gray light he saw the marble houses with their delicate marble window frames and columns, for everything that Florence did so superbly with its <i class="calibre2">pietra serena </i>the master masons of Carrara did with their marble from the quarries in the mountains above.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo liked the Carrarini. He felt at home with them because he was a stone man himself; yet there could be no question but that they were the most inbred, suspicious, insular group he had encountered. They refused to be identified with the Tuscans to their south or with the Ligurians to their north; few left this mountain area, none married outside it; the boys were in the quarries alongside their fathers by the time they were six, and left only at their death. No farmers were permitted to bring their produce to the Carrara markets except those who had been admitted within the walls for generations; when a quarry needed a new man he was selected from the known farming families. Carrara and Massa, the largest of the neighboring towns, had fought each other since time before memory. Even the tiny surrounding villages were raised in the tradition of <i class="calibre2">campanilismo, </i>each group for his own tower or town, and against everyone else.</p>

  <p class="normal">Carrara was a one-crop town: marble. Each day the Carrarino lifted his eyes to the reassuring white slashes in the hills, the patches that resembled snow even in the blinding heat of summer, and thanked God for its sustenance. Their life was communal: when one prospered, all prospered; when one starved, all starved. Their life in the quarries was so dangerous that when they parted from each other they did not say, "Good-by" but <i class="calibre2">"Fa a modr, </i>go carefully."</p>

  <p class="normal">He wound along the Carrione River. The September air was sharp, good for climbing. Below him he could see the fortress-tower of the Rocca Malaspina and the cathedral spire standing guard over the elbow-to-elbow houses wedged into tight walls that had not been expanded for centuries. Soon the mountain villages began to appear, Codena, Miseglia, Bedizzano, each cluster pouring out its male population, feeding rivulets of quarriers into the human stream flowing upward. These were men more like him than his own brothers: small, wiry, tireless, taciturn, with the primordial power of men who work stubborn stone. They pushed upward, <i class="calibre2">matalò </i>or jacket hung on their right shoulder, through Torano, Station of the Bulls.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sleep had their tongues. As first light sifted beyond the peaks they began speaking in clipped monosyllabic hammer strokes, the compact Carrarino language Michelangelo had had to learn, for the Carrarino dialect broke off words the way chips were chiseled off a block, <i class="calibre2">casa </i>becoming <i class="calibre2">ca; mama </i>becoming <i class="calibre2">ma; brasa, </i>embers, becoming <i class="calibre2">bra; bucarol, </i>canvas, becoming <i class="calibre2">buc; </i>a swift efficient language of one-syllable words. They were asking him about yesterday's search through the quarries of Grotta Colombara and Ronco.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You find?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not yet."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Comes today."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I hope."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Go to Ravaccione."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Heard news?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Break out new block."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I try."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pale yellow sunlight silhouetted the rugged cliffs ahead. The milky ravines of marble chips, dumped for centuries from the <i class="calibre2">poggio, </i>or work level below the quarry, emerged like winter drifts of snow. They were up a thousand feet now, moving effortlessly through primeval stands of oak, beech, fir, thorny bushes called <i class="calibre2">bacon </i>and then higher up, through a grass for grazing sheep in the summer, called <i class="calibre2">paleri. </i>Beyond the trees and San Pellegrino flowers, the trails cut across exposed rock with marble cropping to the surface.</p>

  <p class="normal">The stream of two hundred quarriers, fathers and sons, split into rivulets again, making their way up the three main canals or marble draws, each of which had its favored diggings: the Ravaccione, which included the Polvaccio quarry, the Canale di Fantiscritti, which the ancient Romans had opened; and the Canale di Colonnata. As they parted, each murmured:</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Fa a modr, </span></i><span>go carefully."</span></p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Se Dio 'l vorà, </span></i><span>God permitting."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo continued with a group on to the Polvaccio where he had found his best marble for Julius' tomb eleven years before. The Polvaccio, at the extreme end of the Poggio Silvestro, produced good statuary white, but the surrounding quarries of Battaglino, Grotta Colombara and Ronco contained ordinary marbles with slanting veins. As the sun edged over Monte Sagro they reached the nearly mile-high <i class="calibre2">poggio </i>where the crew dropped their jackets and were at work as swiftly as they could raise a hammer. The <i class="calibre2">tecchiaioli, </i>steeplejacks of the quarries, descended their ropes from the precipices above, cleaning the ledges of loose stone, clearing away with their <i class="calibre2">subbie </i>and <i class="calibre2">mazzuoli </i>as they dangled several hundred feet in the air, to protect those working below from falling debris.</p>

  <p class="normal">The owner of the quarry, called The Barrel from his enormous round torso, greeted Michelangelo heartily. Though he was as illiterate as his workmen, his contact with buyers from England, France, Germany and Spain had taught him to speak a near-full sentence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, Buonarroti, today we have your great block."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Permit me to hope."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Barrel grasped him by the arm, led him to the area where water-soaked wooden pegs had been driven into a V-shaped incision and, in the natural course of swelling, had forced an opening in the solid marble cliff which the quarriers were now attacking with levers and sledge hammers, driving the pegs deeper to dislodge the marble from its bed. Since marble was quarried vertically, the topmost blocks were being pried out. The foreman cried, "Fall below!" Workmen sawing blocks with sand and water fled to the edge of the <i class="calibre2">poggio. </i>The topmost block ripped from its hold with the sound of a falling tree, landed with tremendous impact in the level work space below, splitting according to its <i class="calibre2">peli, </i>cracks.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Michelangelo came forward and studied the huge jagged block he was disappointed. Heavy rains soaking through the bare foot or two of earth that had covered the marble for a millennium had carried with them enough chemicals to vein the pure white. The Barrel, looming in front of him, had cut this particular block hoping Michelangelo would be satisfied.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A beautiful piece of meat, no?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is good."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You accept?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is veined."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The cut is near perfect."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I must have perfect."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Barrel lost his temper.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You cost us cash. A month we quarry for you, and not one <i class="calibre2">soldo </i>we see."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will pay you much money... for statuary marbles."</p>

  <p class="normal">"God makes marble. Complain to Him."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not until I am convinced there are not whiter blocks behind these."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You want me to cut down my whole peak?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will have thousands of ducats to spend for the façade of San Lorenzo. You will have your share."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Barrel turned away, a scowl on his face, grumbling something which Michelangelo could not catch, but which sounded as though the owner were calling him "The Big Noise." Since he had not raised his voice, Michelangelo was sure he had misunderstood.</p>

  <p class="normal">He picked up his jacket and dinner, struck out for Ravaccione, using an old goat trail that gave him but a few inches of security as he moved down the cliff. He reached the quarry at ten o'clock. On the <i class="calibre2">poggio </i>level, teams were two-manning long whipsaws across marble blocks with the <i class="calibre2">bardi, </i>apprentices, keeping a stream of sand and water under the teeth. At a chanting call from the foreman, the quarriers who were widening a fault in the stratified marble cliffs above came down to a wooden shed for their dinner. Michelangelo joined them on a plank stretched across two blocks, took out his thick slices of bread flavored with olive oil, vinegar, salt and berry seed, dipped them into the communal bucket of water and ate hungrily. Monna Pelliccia had offered him <i class="calibre2">companatico, </i>a covering for his bread, but he preferred to eat what the quarriers ate.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the best way to get along with the Carrarini; for the Carrarini were special. They said proudly of themselves, "So many heads, so many ideas." During his stay in 1505 when he had been gathering blocks for Julius' tomb he had been received with as much reserve as any of the other foreign sculptors who came to buy marble for their commissions. But as he had spent his days in the quarries, detecting intuitively the hollows, bubbles, veining, knots; as he had worked with the teams to bring his twenty-ton blocks down the steep slopes on rollers with nothing to hold back the oblong cargo but a few ropes tied around nests of wooden stakes, they came to believe that he was not only a sculptor but a quarryman. Now, returning to Carrara, he was accepted as a Carrarino, invited to the taverns on Saturday night where the men gathered to drink the Cinqueterre wine and gamble at <i class="calibre2">bastoni, </i>cards with varying numbered sticks, the winners and losers drinking after each hand until the tavern was drunk with fun and wine.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was proud to be accepted at a table where the gambling chairs passed from father to son as a family inheritance. Once, seeing an empty building on a rise above the town where a half dozen marble shops lined the Carrione, the front wall open to the river, he had thought to himself, "Why should I go back to Rome or Florence to carve my statues when here in Carrara it seems natural rather than peculiar if a man wants to give his whole life to sculpture?" Here in Carrara there were expert <i class="calibre2">smodellatori, </i>men who did the massing from the model; he would never lack for trained assistants. Crossing Florence or Rome after a day of furious carving, covered from head to foot by marble dust, he had been an object of concern if not derision. Here he looked and felt no different from all the other men returning home from the quarries or marble shops. He belonged.</p>

  <p class="normal">At Ravaccione he found himself disappointed for a second time that morning: a new cut, ripped out of the white mountain wall and falling to the <i class="calibre2">poggio </i>below, showed soft fissures. He could not use it for one of his giant figures.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A beautiful block," said the owner, hovering near. "You buy?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perhaps. I will try."</p>

  <p class="normal">Though he had replied courteously, the owner's face set in a grim expression. Michelangelo was about to move on to the next quarry when he heard the sound of the horn coming from the Grotta Colombara, a number of ridges away, echoing up and down the valleys. The quarriers froze in their positions. Then they laid down their tools, draped their jacket over their right shoulder, began a wordless climb down the trail.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of their members had been hurt, perhaps killed. Every quarrier in the Apuan Alps made the hour-long descent to his village, there to await word of the fate of his companion. No further work would be done until the following morning, and none then, if there should be a funeral to attend.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo descended by the path along the river, watched the women washing their clothes in water the color of milk from the marble workshops that swept their dust and chips into the stream. He circled to the bottom of the town, entered the Market of the Pigs, admitted himself to his two-room apartment at the rear of the apothecary's house which sat on a level midway between the shop and the flat of the Pelliccia family above. Apothecary Francesco di Pelliccia, fifty-five, bigger in stature than most of the Carrarini, was the second best-educated man in town, having been trained at the neighboring University of Pisa. He was one of the few men who had set foot outside Carrara, to buy potions from the Near East, and had seen the David in Florence, as well as the Sistine ceiling and the Moses in Michelangelo's house in Rome. Michelangelo had rented these rooms before; the men had become friends. Pelliccia owned important marble quarries, yet he did not use his friendship as an excuse to press his output upon Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pelliccia had gone to attend the injured man. There was a doctor in Carrara but few of the quarriers used him, saying, "Nature cures and the doctors collect." When someone fell ill a member of the family came to the apothecary shop, described the symptoms, and then waited while Pelliccia concocted a prescription.</p>

  <p class="normal">Signora Pelliccia, a busty vigorous woman in her early forties, set the table in the dining room overlooking the Piazza del Duomo. She had saved Michelangelo some of the fresh fish from their midday dinner. He was finishing the <i class="calibre2">minestrone </i>when a groom arrived from the Rocca Malaspina with a note from the Marquis Antonio Alberico II of Carrara, lord of the Massa-Carrara area, requesting that Michelangelo come at once to the castle.</p>

  <p class="chapter">6.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Rocca was a short walk uphill, a fortress bastion which served as the mountain anchor for Carrara, the opposite wall of the horseshoe fortifications being impregnable because of the Carrione River flowing below it. Built in the twelfth century, the Rocca had crenelated defense towers, a moat and thick stone walls to withstand siege: for that was one reason the Carrarini hated all outsiders, they had been overrun continuously for five hundred years. Only lately had the Malaspina family been able to sustain the peace. What had originally been a crude fortress had been converted to an elegant marble palace, with frescoes and furnishings from all over Europe.</p>

  <p class="normal">The marquis was waiting at the head of a majestic flight of stairs. Even while exchanging greetings Michelangelo could not resist admiring the splendid marble floors and columns ringing the stair well. The marquis was tall, courtly, commanding in mien, with a long thin face, high cheekbones and a luxuriant beard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It was kind of you to come, Maestro Buonarroti," the marquis said in his low patriarchal voice. "I thought you might like to see the room where Dante Alighieri slept when he was a guest of my family here."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Dante was a guest here?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Indeed. He wrote some lines of <i class="calibre2">The Divine Comedy </i>about our country. This was his bed. And here the plaque with his verses:</p>

  <p class="block1"><i class="calibre2">"That man whose back is close behind his belly</i></p>

  <p class="block1"><i class="calibre2">Is Arunas, who once dwelt on Luni's mount,</i></p>

  <p class="block1"><i class="calibre2">Near where Carrara's toilers work below;</i></p>

  <p class="block1"><i class="calibre2">And from his cave among the snow-white marbles</i></p>

  <p class="block1"><i class="calibre2">He could observe the galaxy of stars,</i></p>

  <p class="block1"><i class="calibre2">And glimpse the azure of the ocean wave...."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Later, in the paneled library, the marquis got down to business. First be showed Michelangelo a letter from Monna Argentina Soderini, who was also a Malaspina:</p>

  <p class="block1"><i class="calibre2">Master Michelangelo, a sculptor whom my husband deeply loves, and who is a very honest, polite and kind person, of such a value as to make us think that today there is no man in Europe who is similar to him, has gone to Carrara to work a certain quality of marbles. We warmly wish that you offer him every possible benefit and assistance.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">The marquis gazed at Michelangelo. "There is some beginning unpleasantness," he murmured.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Unpleasantness? On what score?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you remember a name that the owner of the quarry called you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I thought I heard him call me 'The Big Noise.' What can it mean?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In Carrarino it means to be a complainer, not to accept what is handed to you. The owners say that you don't seem to know your own mind."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They're partly right," Michelangelo admitted ruefully. "It has to do with the façade for San Lorenzo. I have a suspicion that Pope Leo and Cardinal Giulio concocted the idea just to take me off the Rovere tomb. They have promised me a thousand ducats to buy marbles, but nothing has arrived. For that matter, I too have been remiss: I promised them scale models, but I have not drawn a line since leaving Rome. A troubled mind, Marquis, makes a poor draftsman."</p>

  <p class="normal">"May I make a suggestion? Sign two or three modest contracts for marbles to be delivered in the future. The owners will be reassured. It seems that a number of them who have quarried blocks just for you fear they have cut too much and may have to idle the men. These <i class="calibre2">gente, </i>people, have little reserve. A few weeks' beans and flour separate them from hunger. Threaten this thin margin and you become their enemy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is a narrow precipice. I will do as you suggest."</p>

  <p class="normal">Within the next weeks he signed two contracts, one for eight pieces of marble over eight feet high, plus fifteen smaller ones, with a deposit of a hundred florins; and then bought from Mancino, Left-handed, three pieces of white marble from his quarry at Polvaccio. Two witnesses signed the contract in the Piazza del Duomo. Tension vanished as he promised The Barrel and Pelliccia to buy heavily as soon as money arrived from the Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had dissipated the tensions for the Carrarini, but he could not do as much for himself. Although the Rovere heirs had buckled under to the Pope's demands, writing a third contract which further cut down the size of the tomb and extended the time limit from seven to nine years, Michelangelo knew that they were outraged. Pope Leo had blandly assured the Roveres that he could continue to carve the tomb marbles while he did those for the façade; but no one, least of all Michelangelo, was fooled by this promise. From now on he would work for the Medici as long as there was a Medici Pope in the Vatican. The unfinished tomb was a canker eating at the lining of his stomach. Sebastiano had promised to keep a careful watch over his house in the Marcello dei Corvi; still he worried about his marbles, and the decorated blocks.</p>

  <p class="normal">News from Florence was equally joyless. The city's pleasure in elevating its first Pope had been soured by the fact that the election had cost the city its freedom. Giuliano had died. The Republic was gone, the elected councils banished, the constitution outlawed. The Florentines did not like being ruled by twenty-four-year-old Lorenzo, son of Piero, whose smallest act was dictated by his Roman mother and by Cardinal Giulio. Nor did the arrival of Giulio in Florence to tighten the Medici control do anything to raise its spirits. Buonarroto's shop was operating at a loss. It was not Buonarroto's fault, these were not good times for a new business venture. Buonarroto needed more money, which Michelangelo could not spare.</p>

  <p class="normal">His brother had brought his wife, Bartolommea, into the family house to live. He kept expressing the hope that Michelangelo would like her. She was a good woman. She had nursed Lodovico during a recent illness and was managing the house quite well with only the elderly servant, Monna Margherita, who had been caring for Lodovico since <i class="calibre2">Il Migliore's </i>death. Michelangelo gathered that she was not especially attractive of face or figure, but had brought a substantial dowry, and had a quiet sweetness.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will like her, Buonarroto," Michelangelo told his brother. "Just let us pray that she will produce sons. With Sigismondo living like a nomad, and Giovansimone unwilling to support even a cricket, your good Bartolommea is our only hope to continue the Buonarroti name."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico had become a real problem. He had grown cantankerous, blaming Michelangelo for squandering his funds on the Rovere tomb without completing it; for taking the Medici façade without a contract or guarantees; for not pouring more funds into Buonarroto's shop; for refusing to buy the additional houses in Florence and farms in the surrounding countryside which Lodovico spent months tracking down. The old man barely let a post go by without demands, reproaches and recriminations.</p>

  <p class="normal">Winter rains turned the mountain trails into flooding river beds. Then the snows fell. All work stopped in the mountains. The quarriers in their oozing, cold stone houses in the foothills settled down to remain as warm as possible while consuming as little beans and <i class="calibre2">pasta </i>as possible. Michelangelo bought himself a wagonload of logs, set up his worktable in front of the fire and surrounded himself by letters from Baccio d'Agnolo, who was going to help him build a wooden model of the façade, from Sebastiano telling him that a dozen sculptors, including Raphael, were trying to take the façade commission away from him; and from Domenico Buoninsegni in Rome, an honest and able man in the tradition of Jacopo Galli, who was devoting time to getting a façade contract negotiated, imploring him to come to Rome because Pope Leo was clamoring to see the designs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo paced the cold room, his hands snuggled under his armpits to keep them warm, saying to himself, "I must get back to that wonderful feeling I had when <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico </i>walked me to San Lorenzo and said, 'One day you will carve a façade that will be the wonder of all Italy.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached Rome as the city was preparing for Christmas. He went first to his house and was relieved to find everything as he had left it. His Moses seemed nearer to completion than he had remembered. If only he could steal off a month...</p>

  <p class="normal">He received a hearty reception at the Vatican. Cardinal Giulio appeared to have grown surer of his control of the Church. As Michelangelo knelt to kiss the Pope's ring he noted that Leo's double chin was again cascading over the collar of his ermine robe, the fleshy cheeks almost hiding the small sickly mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It gives me pleasure to see you again, my son," said Leo as he led Michelangelo to the papal library.</p>

  <p class="normal">The aromatic scents of parchment manuscripts took Michelangelo back to the library in the Medici palace; he saw <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico </i>standing with an illuminated volume bound in purple leather. The sharpness of this vision, as though he were recalling a scene enacted only a week instead of twenty-five years before, enhanced the illusion that he was designing the façade for Lorenzo.</p>

  <p class="normal">He spread his sheets of paper on a desk. There was an outline of the unfinished brick of San Lorenzo, then the façade, divided into two floors and a tower, the lower floor with a dividing cornice over the three entrances to the church. Flanking the doors he had drawn four large figures representing the saints Lawrence, John the Baptist, Peter and Paul on the ground floor; in the niches of the second floor, larger than life-size statues of Matthew, Luke and Mark; and on the tower, Damian and Cosmas, represented as physicians, which was what the word "medici" meant. He would carve these nine major figures himself; the rest of the façade was architectural. The nine-year plan would afford him the time to complete Julius' marbles. At the end of the contract both the Medici and the Roveres would be happy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are prepared to be generous," said the Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But one thing must be changed," added Giulio quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is that, Your Grace?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The marbles must come from Pietrasanta. They have the finest statuary marble in the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, Your Grace, I have heard. But there is no road."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A matter of labor."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Roman engineers were said to have tried to open such a road and failed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They did not try hard enough."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a look of finality on Cardinal Giulio's hollow, dark face. Michelangelo surmised that something more than the quality of marble was involved. He turned to Leo with a questioning glance.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will do better in Pietrasanta and Seravezza," the Pope explained. "The Carraresi are a rebellious lot. They have not co-operated with the Vatican. The people of Pietrasanta and Seravezza consider themselves loyal Tuscans. They have signed over their quarries to Florence. Thus we shall secure the purest statuary marble for only the cost of labor."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't believe it is humanly possible to quarry in Pietrasanta, Holiness," protested Michelangelo. "The blocks would have to come out of stone precipices a mile high."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will make the trip to the top of Monte Altissimo and report on what you find."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo did not reply.</p>

  <p class="chapter">7.</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to Carrara, to his rooms behind Pelliccia's apothecary shop. When the Pope's thousand ducats were at last sent to him by Salviati, he put out of his mind any worry about the Pietrasanta quarry and began buying marble almost in a fever: from Jacopo and Antonio three blocks that were on display in the Market of the Pigs, seven blocks from Mancino. He went into partnership with Ragione, Reason, to finance the quarrying of a hundred wagonloads. That was as far as it went. He rejected the wooden model he had hired Baccio d'Agnolo to make, declaring that it "looked like a childish thing." He made one himself... which was no better. He paid La Grassa, a <i class="calibre2">pietra serena </i>hewer from Settignano, to make a clay model... and then destroyed it. When Salviati wrote from Florence, and Buoninsegni from Rome, that the Pope and the cardinal were disappointed that he had not yet poured his foundations, he made a contract with Francesco and Bartolomeo from Torano for another fifty cartloads of marble, despite the fact that he had designed nothing more than the sizes and shapes of the blocks he wanted the <i class="calibre2">smodellatori </i>to mass.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Marquis of Carrara invited him to Sunday dinner at the Rocca, served the traditional Carrarino cake, <i class="calibre2">focaccia, </i>made of sifted wheat flour, eggs, pine nuts and raisins. Afterwards he asked about the Pope's plan for opening quarries in Pietrasanta, news of which had seeped through from Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Be reassured, <i class="calibre2">signore," </i>said Michelangelo. "No work will be done in those mountains."</p>

  <p class="normal">Then came a stinging letter from Buoninsegni:</p>

  <p class="block1">The Cardinal and Pope think you are neglecting the marble at Pietrasanta. They believe you do it on purpose.... The Pope wants Pietrasanta marbles.</p>

  <p class="normal">He told no one of his destination, arranging to have a horse ready at dawn to take him down the coast road. Pietrasanta had once had considerable importance as a boundary stronghold, but unlike the Carrarini, the Pietrasantans no longer enclosed themselves within walls they could not hope to defend. Their houses were built around a spacious square where the markets and festivities were held; the western side was open to a superb view of the Tyrrhenian Sea; the Pietrasanta farmers died in their beds of the incurable malady of old age.</p>

  <p class="normal">He tarried for a moment at the morning market to buy an orange. Above him towered Monte Altissimo, named Highest Mountain by the people of Pietrasanta and Seravezza because its awesome bastion of sheer rock, jutting jaggedly a mile into the skies, dwarfed and intimidated those who lived in its portentous presence. The Carrarini pointed out disdainfully that Monte Altissimo was not the highest mountain at all; Monte Sagro, Pizzo d'Uccello and Pisanino above Carrara were taller. The Pietrasantans made the rejoinder that the Carrarini could live with their peaks, traverse them, quarry them, but that Monte Altissimo was impregnable. The Etruscan, genius with stone, and the Roman army had not conquered its implacable gorges or precipices.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a narrow wagon road between Pietrasanta and the hill town of Seravezza, used for transporting farm products. Michelangelo started up the deeply rutted path to the site of the defending fortress for the hundred families farming the valleys and knolls. Here everything was unrelieved stone, the houses interlocked around a cobbled piazza. He found a room for the night, and a guide in the husky young son of a cobbler. His name was Antonio, called Antò, and he was the possessor of a height of pale pink gums which showed above his stubby teeth when he spoke.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What you pay? Agreed! We start at first light."</p>

  <p class="normal">They left Seravezza in the pitch-dark. The first hour's walk in the rising foothills was not difficult, for Antò knew the terrain. But where the trail ended they had to cut through thickets of underbrush with knives taken from the cobbler's shop. They climbed straight up dark stone ranges, rock formations that looked as though they had been made as steps for the gods, half scrambling, half falling down precipitous gullies, keeping from plunging over cliffs by grappling an occasional tree trunk. They descended deep into gorges as dark as Antò's shop in Seravezza, clammy cold from centuries without sun, then climbed on hands and knees up the next range rolling backward, with Monte Altissimo towering in the background still several uncharted miles away.</p>

  <p class="normal">By midmorning they emerged at the top of a shrub-covered promontory. Between Michelangelo and Monte Altissimo was only a sharp hogback, and beyond this a canyon at the foot of the <i class="calibre2">monte </i>where they would have to cross a river. Antò took from his leather pouch two loaves of heavy-crusted bread, the soft insides scooped out and refilled with fish in tomato sauce. They ate, then went down into the valley before this next to last hogback, worked their way toward a low division where the cascading ranges sloped downward to expose the wall of Monte Altissimo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sat on a boulder looking upward at the fearsome Alps.</p>

  <p class="normal">"With the help of God, and the whole French army, one might get a road built to this point. But how could anyone build a road up that perpendicular wall?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not possible. Why try?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To get marbles out."</p>

  <p class="normal">Antò gazed at Michelangelo, moving his lips up and down incredulously over the field of pink gum.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You never said marble. That's <i class="calibre2">pazzesco! </i>Nobody brings blocks down."</p>

  <p class="normal">"<i class="calibre2">È vero. </i>True."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then why you come?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To make sure. Let's start climbing, Antò. I want to see how good the marbles are that we can't bring down."</p>

  <p class="normal">The marbles were not only good, they were perfect: outcroppings of purest white statuary. He found a <i class="calibre2">poggio </i>where the Romans had dug, fragments of a marble block they had excavated. After the battle to keep their footing up the rocky ravines and gorges until they had passed the snow line, and the struggle to dig the rest of their way up with fingernails and toes, it was clear to Michelangelo why the emperors had used Carrara marble to build Rome. Yet his whole body ached to set hammer and chisel to this shining stone, the purest he had ever seen.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was dusk by the time he reached Carrara. As he came up the road from Avenza he noted that the farmers in the fields did not appear to see him. When he entered the Porta Ghibellina the townspeople in front of their shops suddenly became busy. In the Piazza del Duomo a group of men talking in a tight circle hunched their shoulders toward each other as he passed. He walked into the apothecary's shop where Pelliccia and his son were grinding medications on a slab of marble.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What has happened? I left yesterday morning a Carrarino. I return tonight a Tuscan."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pelliccia said nothing until he had dumped his mixture into the handkerchief of an old woman in black and bade her a <i class="calibre2">"Fa a modr."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"It's your trip up Monte Altissimo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"So your townspeople have adopted the Roman law that a man is guilty until proved innocent?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They are frightened. The opening of quarries in Pietrasanta could destroy them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Please report that I was ordered up Monte Altissimo by the Pope."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They claim it's your doing."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Mine! How?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They trace it to your demand for flawless blocks; say that 'The Big Noise' was heard in Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I have been buying Carrara marbles."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Carrarini feel that in your heart you have been searching for the <i class="calibre2">sanctum sanctorum, </i>the pure white soul of the mountain; and that that was why Pope Leo ordered you to open Pietrasanta: to find the perfect marbles that would satisfy you."</p>

  <p class="normal">For the moment Michelangelo could not answer. He knew that the Pope and Cardinal Giulio had assumed ownership of Monte Altissimo, that they were punishing the Carrarini who were anti-Vatican. But were the Carrarini instinctively right about him? Not once in the past seven months, even after he had paid out good money for their blocks, had he been satisfied that he had secured the best statuary white. Had he been yearning for the Pope to open the Pietrasanta quarries, even while he proclaimed the feat impossible?</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall report to His Holiness that no marbles can be brought down from Monte Altissimo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They can rely on you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I give them my word of honor."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That will be good news."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was more amused than concerned when he learned that Baccio d'Agnolo and Bigio had been granted five hundred ducats to go into the Seravezza mountains and lay out a road. He knew them both; they could not lay out a corpse.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a prosperous spring for Carrara, with sculptors coming in to buy marbles, staying in the parish house across the bridge from the Duomo: Bartolomeo Ordoñez from Spain, Giovanni de' Rossi and Maestro Simoni from Mantua, Domenico Garé of France, Don Bernardino de Chivos working for Charles I of Spain. He too felt prosperous, for the Medici had agreed to pay him twenty-five thousand ducats for the façade.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Sansovino, apprentice to his old friend Andrea Sansovino from the Medici garden, arrived in Carrara on a rainy afternoon and stood with his back to Michelangelo's fire to get dry. Jacopo was an attractive chestnut-haired man of thirty who had taken his master's family name and appeared to have talent. Michelangelo had seen him at Sansovino's studio on and off for a number of years.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Jacopo, it's good to see a Florentine face. What brings you to Carrara in this bad weather?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Me? How?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Pope Leo has promised me the frieze."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What frieze?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why, on your façade, of course! I submitted my design to the Pope and he was enchanted."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned his face away so that Jacopo would not see his astonishment.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I have indicated no frieze."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope opened a competition for anyone wanting to make a contribution. I won. With a continuous bronze band above the three portals, showing scenes from the life of the Medici."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Suppose your frieze does not fit into my design?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You do your work, and I'll do mine."</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo's tone was not insolent, yet it admitted of no argument. Michelangelo said quietly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have never collaborated, Jacopo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What the Holy Father says, is done."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Assuredly. But under my agreement I am bound to correct the faults in anyone else's work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There will be no faults. Trust me. You have more to worry about with Baccio and Bigio."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What about Baccio and Bigio?" Michelangelo felt his spine stiffen.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They are to do all the decorated stones and columns."</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not sleep that night. He kept logs on the fire, pacing the two rooms of his apartment while he tried to grapple with the depths of his mind. Why had he let these months go by without completing a model which the Pope and Cardinal Giulio could approve, without designing the major figures, or returning to Florence to lay the foundations? By giving himself a sense of motion, by buying hundreds of marbles, he had created the illusion of direction. The visit of Jacopo Sansovino with the news that the façade was being drained away from him proved he had been wrong. He had been standing still; for an artist, one of the more painful forms of death.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no more time to spare. Since he had to carve this façade he might as well start at once and carve the whole of it: squares, columns, cornices and capitals as well as saints.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wrote to Rome:</p>

  <p class="block1">I promise you, Holy Father, that the façade of San Lorenzo will be a mirror of architecture and sculpture for all Italy.</p>

  <p class="chapter">8.</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to Florence in the spring, in time to celebrate the birth of Buonarroto's daughter Francesca, whom he nicknamed Cecca. He invited his friends to the house on the Via Ghibellina for <i class="calibre2">vin santo, </i>holy wine and cake, then went out to buy a piece of land on the Via Mozza, near Santa Caterina, on which to build a studio large enough to house the big blocks for the façade and for Julius' tomb. He had to deal with the canons of the Duomo, who charged him three hundred large gold florins for the land, sixty more than Michelangelo knew it to be worth. When he protested, the canon replied gravely:</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are sorry, but we cannot deviate from the papal bull concerning sales."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then let me have that extra piece at the back for the sixty florins you have overcharged."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you have us go against an order of the Holy Father?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He worked for several weeks to finish the design from which he would build his wooden model. As he expanded his concept, adding five half-relief histories in square frames, two in circular frames, he expanded his costs so that it would be impossible to create the façade for less than thirty-five thousand ducats. The Pope retorted through Buoninsegni, who wrote:</p>

  <p class="block1">They like your new plan, but you have raised your price by ten thousand ducats. Is this for extensions of the façade, or a miscalculation of your earlier plans?</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo replied, "This will be the architectural and sculptural marvel of Italy! When will payments be forthcoming?" Buoninsegni answered:</p>

  <p class="block1">Money is tight, there is very little available, but do not be suspicious, your contract will be signed. Start work at once on the foundations. His Holiness is disturbed that you have not built them yet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Sansovino, informed by the Vatican that the new model showed no bronze frieze, came to Michelangelo and launched into a scathing attack.</p>

  <p class="normal">"May the day be cursed on which you ever said anything good about anybody on earth!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now, Jacopo, I have spoken highly of your work. I tried to tell you in Carrara..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You tried to tell me that there was no room for anyone but yourself. That's all that was involved."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Jacopo, don't let us part as enemies. I promise to help you get a commission. Then you will understand that a work of art cannot be a symposium; it must have the organic unity of one man's mind and hands. Anything else is a Livornese fish stew."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico chose this time to reproach him for not making available to him the <i class="calibre2">spedalingo </i>funds at Santa Maria Nuova.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Father, if you don't stop this eternal nagging, the house will no longer be big enough for the two of us."</p>

  <p class="normal">By nightfall Lodovico was gone, his room empty. The following evening Buonarroto returned with news that Lodovico was telling everyone he had been driven out of his own house.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where is he staying?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the peasant's cottage behind our house in Settignano."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll send a note to him at once."</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat down at Lodovico's pie-shaped account desk, which looked strange in this conventionally square room, and wrote:</p>

  <p class="block1">Dearest Father—I hear you are complaining about me and saying that I have driven you from the house. I marvel, for I am quite sure that from the day I was born till now my mind has never harbored a thought, great or small, that was detrimental to you. Every labor I have undertaken has been accepted by me for love of you... and you know that I have bestowed all I possess upon you.</p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">You have had thirty years' experience of me, you and your sons, and you are well aware that I have ever thought and acted, when I was able, for your good. How can you go about saying I have turned you out of doors? Do you not see what a character you are giving me?... This is all that was wanting to complete my tale of troubles. You repay me well.</span></p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">But let it be as it may: I am willing to accept the position that I have brought you nothing but shame and disgrace.... I implore you to forgive me, like the scoundrel I am....</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico returned to the Via Ghibellina, forgave him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Florence was depressed, the Florentine pleasure-loving tradition having moved to Leo's court in Rome. His own joylessness was increased when he learned that his cartoon for the Bathers had vanished.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Destroyed would not be precisely the right word," said Granacci gravely. "Traced, written on, worn out, cut apart, stolen."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But how? It belonged to Florence. Why wasn't it protected?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci gave him the details. The cartoon had been sent to the Hall of the Popes near Santa Maria Novella, then to the upper hall of the Medici palace. A hundred artists passing through Florence had worked before it unsupervised, some cutting out portions to take with them. His enemy from the Perugino quarrel, the sculptor Baccio Bandinelli, was alleged to have appropriated a number of sections. The only fragments still in Florence were those purchased by his friends the Strozzi.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So I joined Leonardo," he observed morosely. "My cartoon is gone. Just like my bronze of Julius."</p>

  <p class="normal">The only one who was able to put his troubles into perspective was Prior Bichiellini, so old and frail now that he was confined to his bed in Santo Spirito.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Try to think of your whole life as a unity, rather than a series of unrelated fragments," counseled the Father. "That way each period grows out of the last, and you know there will be another to come."</p>

  <p class="normal">He concentrated on the façade, built a solid model, grooving the columns, decorating the capitals, blocking out the niches which would carry his marbles, making wax figures to represent his final sculptures. Pope Leo signed a contract for forty thousand ducats: five thousand a year for eight years, four thousand forthwith for expenses, and a free dwelling near the church of San Lorenzo. However...</p>

  <p class="normal">"His Holiness wills that all work to be done on the façade of San Lorenzo shall be carried out with marble from Pietrasanta, and no other."</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood bareheaded in the cemetery of San Lorenzo listening to the last rites for Prior Bichiellini, and feeling that he had lost the dearest and best man on earth. For the saintly prior another period would grow out of the last: his reward in heaven. For Michelangelo, watching his friend being lowered into the grave, the "other period to come" could be pure inferno.</p>

  <p class="normal">Within an hour of his return to Carrara a crowd began to gather in the Piazza del Duomo, pouring in from the plains below the Market of the Pigs, down the road along the Carrione River and through the Porta del Bozzo, down the mountainsides from Torano, Colonnata, Forestieri, from the quarries in Polvaccio, Fantiscritti, Grotta Colombara, Battaglino. The Carrarini were several hundred strong now, fitting closer and closer in the square beneath the apothecary's windows, spilling under the overhead bridge into the space before the Duomo.</p>

  <p class="normal">The apothecary's dining-room windows were of floor-to-ceiling height, the center pair being glass doors. Though there was no balcony, the doors could be opened; outside was a low wrought-iron railing. Michelangelo stood behind the curtained doors listening to the murmur grow in intensity as the quarriers continued to jam into the square. Then someone spied him behind the curtains. A movement went through the crowd. They began shouting.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Big Noise! Big Noise!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo glanced at his host's distraught face, torn between loyalty to his people and to his guest.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'd better go into the square," Michelangelo declared.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Too dangerous. When they're frightened, they're ugly. They could trample you to death."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll have to talk to them."</p>

  <p class="normal">He threw open the glass doors, stepped before the two-foot railing. A shout came up from below:</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"'Figiol d'un can'. </span></i><span>Son of a female dog!"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Fists were clenched upward to him. He held his arms out, trying to quiet them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your words of honor are droppings of sheep."</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is not my doing. You must believe me."</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Bastardo! </span></i><span>Bastard! You have sold us."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"Have I not bought marbles from you? I have new contracts to give. Trust me. I am Carrarino!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are servant of the Pope!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will suffer more from this than you."</p>

  <p class="normal">A silence fell over the crowd. A man in front cried in ill-suppressed anguish:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will not suffer in the belly!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The cry acted like a signal. A hundred arms were raised. Stones filled the air like hail. Fragments of white marble broke one glass door, then the other.</p>

  <p class="normal">A large stone struck him on the forehead. He was stunned; more from the impact than the pain. Blood began to trickle down his face. He felt it wet his eyebrow, circle and seep into the corner of his eye.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made no move to stanch the flow. The crowd saw what had happened. Murmuring swept the piazza.</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Basta! </span></i><span>We have drawn blood."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The mass began to liquefy, streams flowing past the cathedral out the streets from which they had come. Within a matter of minutes the piazza was deserted, with only the white stones and broken glass to tell what had happened. He rubbed the palm of his hand across his eye, looked at the dark matted ooze. He had bled from marble before: chips from his too frenzied chiseling had sometimes hit him in the face, piercing the skin. But this was the first time he had been stoned.</p>

  <p class="chapter">9.</p>

  <p class="normal">He rented a house on the sea side of the Pietrasanta piazza, with a view of the mile-wide marsh he was going to have to traverse to make a port, retaining the elderly couple who owned the place to take care of him. Cardinal Giulio had informed him that he must also dig marbles for the building of St. Peter's and for repairs to the Duomo in Florence. The Wool Guild was sending an expert to build his road.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was March, he had about six months of good weather before snow and ice closed down the mountains. If he could start the marble columns flowing out of the quarries and onto the beach by October, his job would be done... if it could be started at all! He would have the first blocks shipped to Florence where he would spend the winter carving them. When good weather came again, a foreman and crew could return to run the quarry.</p>

  <p class="normal">He listed his needs, set out for Carrara and made directly for the supply shops above the town and outside the walls. He entered a hemp store, the first in the row of provisioners along the river.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I need stout rope."</p>

  <p class="normal">The owner did not look up from his cording.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Have none."</p>

  <p class="normal">He continued up the street to an ironmonger. The smith was pounding metal on his anvil.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I want to buy a forge and some iron bars."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All out."</p>

  <p class="normal">The tool shop next door was the best in the area.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could you sell me some picks, axes, two-man saws..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Short supply."</p>

  <p class="normal">He went into the mountains seeking out the owners with whom he had signed contracts and to whom he had paid big sums of money.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Come to Pietrasanta with me, Left-handed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Big contract. Can't leave."</p>

  <p class="normal">In the next canal he urged Reason:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Lend me your foreman for six months. I'll pay you the double."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can't spare."</p>

  <p class="normal">He climbed higher, heading for the remote quarries whose men centered around their own campanile instead of Carrara.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Work my quarry instead of yours. I'll pay you the same profit, plus a contract for blocks from your quarry for next year. What do you say?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The proprietor's eyes gleamed at the thought of the extra cash; but the enthusiasm quickly faded.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't want the horn to blow for me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Since he had no chance in the quarries he dropped down the trace quickly to town, entered the apothecary's house through the rear garden and sought out his friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have been hiring and training foremen all your life. Send one to me. I need help. Everyone else has refused me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pelliccia said sadly, "I know. I am your friend. Friends should not desert each other."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you will help?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You mean you won't."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's the same. No man would go. They stand by their campanile. This is the gravest danger our commune has faced since the French army overran us. And this shop? It would be as though someone fingered the sign of the plague in ashes on the front door. I ask your forgiveness."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo averted his eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The error was mine, to come."</p>

  <p class="normal">Feeling more fatigued than if he had carved for twenty hours, he once again went through the marble-paved streets, passing the housewives wrapped in their <i class="calibre2">scialima, </i>shawl, until he reached the Rocca Malaspina. The marquis was not only the owner of much of Carrara but the sole government of the marquisate. His word was law. The marquis welcomed him in a manner grave but not hostile.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope is powerless here," he explained. "He cannot force men to dig marble out of the mountain. Not even if he excommunicates the whole province."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then, by implication, neither can you order them to quarry for me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The marquis smiled thinly. "A wise prince never issues orders which he knows will not be obeyed."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a lacerated silence in the room, until a servant came in to serve wine and <i class="calibre2">pasmata, </i>baked rolls, an Easter specialty.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Marquis, I have spent a thousand ducats for marbles that are still sitting in the quarries. What about them?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do your contracts call for the marbles to be taken to the shore?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They do."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you may rest assured that they will be delivered. We fulfill our contracts."</p>

  <p class="normal">The blocks and columns were brought down from the mountains on marble carts, heavy stones dragging on the rear wheels as brakes. But when they had all been deposited on the beach the Carrarini boatmen refused to transport them to Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not in the contract."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know that. I'm willing to pay a good fee. I want them taken to Pisa, then up the Arno while it is still high."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No bottoms."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your barges are sitting here, idle."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Busy tomorrow. No space."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo swore, mounted his horse and made the long hard journey through Spezia and Rapallo to Genoa. Here were plenty of shipowners eager for work. They figured out the number of barges that would be necessary. Michelangelo paid in advance, made an appointment to meet them at Avenza to direct the loading.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two mornings later, when the Genoese barges came into sight, a Carrara rowboat put out to meet them. Michelangelo waited on the beach, chafing at the delay. At last the rowboat returned, carrying the Genoese captain. He glanced at Michelangelo's blocks and columns, said out of one corner of his mouth:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can't carry them. Too big."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo went white with rage.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I gave you the number, weights, sizes!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Too many."</p>

  <p class="normal">The captain tossed a money pouch at Michelangelo, departed in the rowboat. The Carrarini on the beach stood expressionless, then turned and trudged up the long plain.</p>

  <p class="normal">The following day he rode down the coast to Pisa. As he approached the city, saw the tower leaning against its background of blue sky, he remembered his first trip here with Bertoldo when he was fifteen, and his teacher had taken him to the Camposanto to prove that he had not copied the ancient Roman Battle of the Centaurs. Now he was forty-three. Could it be only twenty-eight years since he had studied the marvelous Nicola Pisano sculptures in the Baptistery? The longer he lived the farther he got from Bertoldo's sternest admonition: "You must create a great body of work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How?" he wondered, tiredly.</p>

  <p class="normal">He found a reliable captain, paid a deposit, returned to Pietrasanta. The boats did not come on the agreed day... nor the next... nor the next. He and his costly, rigidly selected marbles had been abandoned. How was he going to get them off the Carrara beach?</p>

  <p class="normal">He knew nowhere else to try. He had a quarry to open. He would simply have to leave them there. Later he could try again.</p>

  <p class="normal">The <i class="calibre2">pietra serena </i>quarriers of Settignano knew that whatever fame Michelangelo had achieved had been purchased at a high price. They did not envy him as they watched his lean figure trudging up the road. But as he came in view of the open cliff, saw the angled strata of blue-gray stone, the men working the face, his spirits revived, he broke into a broad grin. Below, a crew was sledge-hammering the jagged cuts into salable sizes. It was time for dinner; small boys arrived with branches across their shoulders, a pot of hot food balancing at either end. The stonemen assembled at the mouth of their cave.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Anyone know where there's a quarry short on orders?" he asked. "I could use some good men at Pietrasanta."</p>

  <p class="normal">They would not want it said that they had refused an old companion; yet the quarries were working, and when there was work a man could not leave.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is fortunate," he exclaimed. He refrained from adding, But not for me. "Do you think I might try in the neighborhood? Behind the Pitti palace? At Prato?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The men gazed at each other in silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Try."</p>

  <p class="normal">He visited other stone diggings, a <i class="calibre2">pietra dura </i>pit, the Cava di Fossato, Coverciano, the <i class="calibre2">pietra forte </i>quarry at Lombrellino. The men were working; there was no reason to leave their homes and families; there was serious apprehension about the mountains above Pietrasanta. In desperation he trudged back to Settignano to the Topolinoa. The sons were running the yard, with seven mingled grandsons ranging from seven years upward, learning their craft. Bruno, the oldest, with close-cropped, shot-gray hair, negotiated the contracts; Enrico, the middle brother, trained by the grandfather for the most delicate work, columns and lacy carved windows, was the artist of the trio; Gilberto, the most vigorous, squared and beveled with the speed of three stonehewers. This was his last chance; if his Topolino family would not help him, no one would. He laid out his situation fully, omitting none of the hardships or dangers.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could one of you come along? I must have someone I can trust."</p>

  <p class="normal">He could hear the three of them pool their silent thinking. Finally all eyes rested on Bruno.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We can't let you go alone," said Bruno slowly. "One must come."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Which?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not Bruno," said Enrico; "there are contracts to discuss."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not Enrico," said Gilberto; "only he does finish work."</p>

  <p class="normal">The two older brothers looked at Gilberto, said together:</p>

  <p class="normal">"That leaves you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That leaves me." Gilberto scratched the bushy hair on his chest while looking at Michelangelo. "I have least skill but most strength. I will do?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will do. I am grateful."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do not stir gratitude into family soup," replied Enrico, who had absorbed his grandfather's supply of folk sayings along with his skill at the grinding wheel.</p>

  <p class="normal">Over the next days Michelangelo assembled a crew: Michele who had worked with him in Rome, the three Fancelli brothers: Domenico, a tiny fellow but a good sculptor, Zara, whom Michelangelo had known for years, and Sandro, the youngest. La Grassa of Settignano, the mason who had made a model for him, agreed to come, as well as a group of assorted stonemen who were tempted by his offer of a double wage. His heart sank when he assembled them to give instructions for leaving in his hired farm wagon the following morning: twelve stonecutters. Not one quarrier in the lot! How could he tackle a savage mountain with this inexperienced crew?</p>

  <p class="normal">While pondering his way home he passed a group of stonehewers laying new blocks in the Via Sant'Egidio. Among them he was astonished to see Donate Benti, a marble sculptor who had worked in France on successful commissions.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Benti! In the name of God, what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Benti, though only thirty, had been born with an old face; he had purple pockets under his eyes, a seamed face with the lines culminating in a crosshatch on his chin. His manner was solemn. He wrung his hands in silent supplication, replied:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Making small sculptures for people's feet to trod on. While little I eat agrees with me, I still have to swallow some food occasionally."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can pay you more in Pietrasanta than you can get in the street. What do you say? I need you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You need me," repeated Benti, his owl-eyes batting up and down in disbelief. "Those could be the most beautiful words in the Italian language. I'll come."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good. Be at my house in the Via Ghibellina at first light. There'll be fourteen of us going by wagon."</p>

  <p class="normal">That evening Salviati came to Michelangelo's house with a gray-eyed man with thinning hair, whom he introduced as Vieri, a seventh cousin, once removed, of Pope Leo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vieri will go to Pietrasanta with you as your commissary. He will arrange for food, for supplies, for transportation, and keep the records. The Wool Guild will pay his salary."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've been worried about who would keep the figures."</p>

  <p class="normal">Salviati smiled. "Vieri is an artist with accounts. His books will be balanced as perfectly as your David, with never a <i class="calibre2">baiocco </i>out of place."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vieri spoke in the constricted voice of a man who had little liking for words. "It's the columns of figures that are the masters... until they balance. Only then have I made them obey."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a happy departure, after all, for his sister-in-law Bartolommea was delivered of a healthy boy, whom they named Simone; and at long last the Buonarroti-Simoni name was safe for the future.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vieri, Gilberto Topolino and Benti moved into the Pietrasanta house with him, Vieri taking one of the bedrooms for his office. Michelangelo then found a larger house in Seravezza for the remaining nine workers. He marked out the most promising route to the quarry area, set the men to work with picks and shovels to cut a trail up which the burros could carry supplies. A number of farm boys came to work under Antò's supervision, wielding sledge hammers to break out the mountain stone and form a safe ledge for passage. When it became evident that the one smith in Seravezza could not handle their needs, Benti sent for his godfather, Lazzero, a squat, neckless, bull-torsoed man who set up a forge to serve both the quarry and the road, and to build the special iron-supported wagons for transporting the marble columns down to the sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo, Michele, Gilberto and Benti went prospecting, found several strata of variegated marbles on the lower levels of Monte Altissimo; and then, just one jutting crag below the summit unearthed a formation of pure statuary marble, breath-takingly crystalline white, flawless in color and composition.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's true!" Michelangelo cried to Benti; "the higher the mountain, the purer the marble."</p>

  <p class="normal">He summoned his crew, had Antò's men help him carve a level area on the peak from which they could mine. The marble ran straight back in a solid white sheet, an entire cliff of marble to be removed, the surface slightly weathered by snow and wind and rain, but below this outer skin, absolute purity.</p>

  <p class="normal">"All we have to do now," he exclaimed exultantly, "is strip out great blocks that have been here since Genesis."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And get them off this mountain," added Benti, gazing downward the five or six miles, past Seravezza and Pietrasanta to the sea. "Frankly, I'm more worried about the road than the marble."</p>

  <p class="normal">The first weeks of quarrying were a total waste. Michelangelo showed the men how the Carrarini drove in their wet pegs along the seams and faults, how the pegs swelled until the marble cracked, and were then hewn out with giant levers. But marble and its quarriers were like lovers, they knew each other's every mood, transition, disposition to oppose or give in. Marble had always been the temperamental queen of hard mountain formations, yet the most easily shattered because of its delicacy: an obstinate gem demanding devotion and tenderness.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of these things the Settignano stonemasons knew nothing. Nor did Benti or Domenico, even though they had carved statues. Michelangelo learned by trial and error, leaning heavily on his years of watching the Carrarini work the blocks, trying to absorb generations of skill in a few months. His crew of stonemasons did their best, but they made mistakes. The <i class="calibre2">pietra serena </i>on which they had been trained was infinitely more durable. They were not equipped to handle the Shining Stone; it would have been as well if he had brought in a dozen carpenters or blacksmiths.</p>

  <p class="normal">As foreman, Gilberto Topolino was a volcano of energy; he hustled, bustled, attacked the mountain violently, kept the others going at a fearsome pace; but Gilberto knew only how to fashion <i class="calibre2">pietra serena </i>building stones held between his knees. The nature of the marble infuriated him by its arrogant toughness when it should have been as crumbly as sugar, and by dissolving granularly under his <i class="calibre2">subbia </i>and <i class="calibre2">mazzuolo </i>when it should have had solid substance.</p>

  <p class="normal">Burly La Grassa complained:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's like working in the dark."</p>

  <p class="normal">After a week of work at a lower outcropping where Domenico said they had found something good, they cut a block which turned out to have swirling circles of dark veins, useless for their purposes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vieri proved to be an excellent commissary, getting the lowest possible prices for food and supplies, keeping costs down. He had a receipt to show for every denaro laid out, but at the end of the month the immaculate accounts were of small comfort to Michelangelo. He had not yet quarried one ducat's worth of usable marble.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You see, Buonarroti, my figures balance beautifully," said Vieri.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But how much marble have I to balance the one hundred and eighty ducats?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Marble? My task is to show where every scudo went."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And mine is to have marble to show for the expenditures."</p>

  <p class="normal">By now it was close to June. The Wool Guild had not yet sent a superintendent to build the road. Michelangelo knew from the steepness of the terrain, and the fact that it would have to be cut through solid rock much of the way, that unless it was started immediately it could not be completed before the whiter storms shut them down. At last the builder arrived: Bocca, Mouth, an illiterate laborer on the roads of Tuscany in his youth, who had had the extra energy and ambition to learn how to draw maps, to boss road crews, and finally to contract for building roads between farm villages. The Wool Guild had chosen Bocca, a brute of a man, hairy from his skull to his toes, because of his reputation for pushing through contracts in record time. Michelangelo showed Bocca his drawings for the projected route.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I see the mountain myself," broke in Bocca. "Where I find a good place I build a good road."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bocca had trained himself well. Within ten days he had mapped the simplest possible route to the base of Monte Altissimo. The only trouble was that the road was not directed toward those places where the marble was to be found. After Michelangelo had lowered his twenty-ton blocks down the ravines of Monte Altissimo by hand, he would still be a considerable distance from Bocca's road!</p>

  <p class="normal">He insisted that Bocca accompany him to the topmost quarries, Polla and Vincarella, then down the ravines he would have to use to lower his columns.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You see, Bocca, I could never get my blocks to your road."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I took contract to build to Monte. This is where I build."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What purpose will the road serve if I can't get the marble out?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm road. You're marble."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But there is nothing at the other end of your road except marble," cried Michelangelo, exasperated. "I will have a thirty-two-bull team hauling the wagons... we are not hauling hay! The road must be the best route from the quarries. Like this, for example...."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Bocca was agitated he pulled on the inch-long hairs growing out of his nostrils and ears; he took a clump of black tendrils between his thumb and forefinger, massaging them downward.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You build or I build. Not both."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a warm night, the stars hanging low over the sea in brilliant clusters. Michelangelo walked for miles south on the coast road, passing sleeping villages while he wrestled with his problem. What purpose would the road serve if it could not move his marble? Would it not be considered his fault if he did not get his columns down to the sea? Bocca's route would be worthless, for it went nowhere! What to do about the man?</p>

  <p class="normal">He could complain to Pope Leo, Cardinal Giulio, Salviati, have another road builder sent in. But what assurance would he have that the second contractor would follow the course he himself thought best? The Pope might even say that this was his <i class="calibre2">terribilità, </i>that he could not get along with anyone.</p>

  <p class="normal">What was his alternative?</p>

  <p class="normal">He must build the road himself!</p>

  <p class="normal">A tortured groan racked the warm night air. He looked about him, saw only the dark marsh between himself and the sea. How could he take upon himself the building of a road in some of the wildest country of Italy? He had never built a road. He was a sculptor. What did he know of such matters? It would put him under crushing hardships. It would mean summoning and supervising still another crew as they filled the marsh, cut down trees, blasted a passage through solid walls of rock. He knew what Pope Leo and Cardinal Giulio would say, the same thing that Pope Julius had said when he had fought so bitterly to avoid painting the Sistine vault, and then had conceived a plan which quadrupled his work.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had cried to Leo and Giulio, "I am not a quarrier!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he wanted to be an engineer.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leo would exclaim:</p>

  <p class="normal">"How is one to understand you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">That was one question he could not answer. Though he had not yet brought forth so much as one usable base block, he had seen the glorious meat of Monte Altissimo. He knew that he would eventually quarry its statuary marble. When he did, he had to have a proper road.</p>

  <p class="normal">Had he not learned over the years that a sculptor had to be an architect and engineer as well? If he could carve the Bacchus, the Pietà, the David, the Moses; if he could design a mausoleum for Pope Julius and a façade for San Lorenzo, why should a five-mile road be more difficult?</p>

  <p class="chapter">10.</p>

  <p class="normal">He used the rutted farm tracks into Seravezza, swung to the north of the village to avoid the Vezza River and gorge, then mapped the road to make straight for Monte Altissimo despite the fact that huge boulders sat astride his route. He laid out stakes up the valley of the Sera to the cluster of stone houses at Rimagno, crossed the Sera River at a shallow ford and followed the contour of the bank up the steep gorge. At two points he chose to tunnel through solid rock rather than try to push the road up a hogback and then serpentine down into the valley again. For a terminus he chose a spot at the base of the two ravines down which he planned to lower the blocks from Vincarella and Polla.</p>

  <p class="normal">For two ducats he bought a walnut tree, and had a Massa wagonmaker build a two-wheeled cart with iron fitted over its wheels to carry the cut rock to the marsh between Pietrasanta and the sea. He made sad-faced Donate Benti superintendent of road construction from Pietrasanta to the base of the Monte Altissimo canal; Michele was given charge of the marsh fill; Gilberto Topolino remained as foreman of Vincarella, the quarry some forty-five hundred feet high in the Alps, at the last possible footing in the sheer precipice where a <i class="calibre2">poggio </i>could be dug to provide work space for excavation.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the end of June Vieri presented him with a stern face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'll have to stop building your road."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Stop... but why?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's no more money."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Wool Guild is rich. They're paying the costs."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All I have received is one hundred florins. They have been spent. Here, see how the columns balance."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The only columns I want to see are those of marble. And I can't get them to the port without a road."</p>

  <p class="msonormalindent"><i class="calibre2"><span>"Peccato. </span></i><span>Too bad. Perhaps the money will arrive soon. Until then..." Vieri arched both hands outward in an eloquent gesture of defeat. "...<i class="calibre2">finito, </i>finished."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't stop now. Use my other money."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your private money for marbles? You can't spend it on the road."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's the same. No road, no marbles. Pay the bills out of my eight-hundred-ducat account."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But you may never get them back. You will have no legal hold over the Wool Guild..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't have any hold over anybody," Michelangelo replied hoarsely. "Until I get the marbles out, the Holy Father won't let me be a sculptor. Spend my money for the road. When the Wool Guild sends in cash, pay me back."</p>

  <p class="normal">From sunrise to dark he was up and down the mountains on a sure-footed mule, watching progress. Benti was doing a fast job on the road, except that he was leaving the heaviest rock work for the end; Gilberto had removed the earth from the Vincarella strata of marble and was driving wet pegs into the faults; the local <i class="calibre2">carradori, </i>cart owners, were dumping tons of loose rock into the marsh, slowly building up the base to the beach where Michelangelo planned his harbor. With a hundred long hot workdays of summer ahead, he estimated he would have several columns for the master figures of his façade lowered down the canal to the loading platform by the end of September.</p>

  <p class="normal">By July, according to Vieri's accounts, he had spent over three hundred of his eight hundred ducats. On Sunday after early mass he sat with Gilberto on the wooden railing of the Ponte Stazzemese, the hot sun beating on their bare backs while they gazed across the hamlet of Stazzema to the sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gilberto glanced sideways at his friend's face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I want to tell you... so you won't be there when they leave..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"When who leaves?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Half the crew: Angelo, Francesco, Bartolo, Barone, Tommaso, Andrea, Bastiano. When Vieri pays them they go back to Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But why?" Michelangelo was shocked. They're well paid..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They're frightened. They think the marble get us, instead we get the marble."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's foolishness! We have a good block going. It'll be pried out in a week."</p>

  <p class="normal">Gilberto shook his head. "A strong veining has shown. The front is waste. We have to drive deeper into the cliff..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How?" Michelangelo cried. "With half a dozen men who don't know what they're doing?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Gilberto hung his head. "Forgive me, Michelangelo. I have failed you. Nothing from what I know of <i class="calibre2">pietra serena </i>is of any use here."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo put an arm about Gilberto's dejected shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're doing the best you can. I'll find new masons. You see, Gilberto, I don't have the privilege of quitting."</p>

  <p class="normal">By mid-September they were ready to tunnel through the three huge rocks they had by-passed: one at the edge of Seravezza, the second just beyond Rimagno, and the last where the river ran into an old trail. His road would be finished. He had dumped enough rock into the marsh to fill the whole Tyrrhenian Sea, but the constantly sinking and shifting roadbed was at last secure to the beach. Up in Vincarella, though it had cost an extra six weeks of hewing back into the mountain the whole thickness of the column to avoid the vein, he had at last managed to bring out a magnificent block. He also had a column at the edge of the <i class="calibre2">poggio. </i>Though some of the new men had drifted away, grumbling about how hard he worked them, he was happy with the results of the summer.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know it has seemed endless to you, Gilberto; but now that we have established a <i class="calibre2">modus operandi, </i>we'll get out another three or four columns before the rain closes us down."</p>

  <p class="normal">The following morning he started to move the enormous column down the ravine, well filled over the months with marble chips to provide a smooth sliding base. The column was roped half a dozen tines around its width, several times around its length, crowbarred onto wooden rollers, then pushed and dragged to the edge of the <i class="calibre2">poggio, </i>its nose turned over the edge of the canal. Down the length of the draw, on either side, nests of stakes had been driven into the ground, angling outward. The ropes from the column, tied around these stakes, were the only hold the crews would have on the marble.</p>

  <p class="normal">Down it went, held by some thirty men. Michelangelo, imitating the calls of the Carrara crews, a series of sung and shouted notes, directed the men handling the rollers to run with the one at the rear, when the end of the marble had passed, and put it under the front; and the men at the stake nests, holding the ropes with all their might until the column had slid past them, to run down the trail to the next stakes to tie up their ropes and apply the brake. Hours passed, the sun rose high in the heavens, the men sweated, swore, strained, complained that they were starving.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We can't stop to eat," Michelangelo cried. "There's no way to secure the marble. It could get away from us."</p>

  <p class="normal">Down the long steep ravine the column slid, the crew exerting all its strength to hold it back, to slow its movement. It inched forward a hundred yards, two hundred, three, four, five, down almost the entire face of Monte Altissimo, until by late afternoon they were only thirty-five yards from the road. Michelangelo was jubilant; very soon now they would slide the column onto the loading platform, from which it would be moved onto the special wagon drawn by the team of thirty-two bulls.</p>

  <p class="normal">He never quite knew how the accident happened. An agile young Pisan named Gino, who was running the rollers forward, had just kneeled to put another roller under the front of the column when suddenly there was a cry of alarm, something snapped, and the column started to move on its own.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were shouts: "Gino! Get out! Quick!"</p>

  <p class="normal">But it was too late. The column rolled over Gino, swerved toward Michelangelo. He threw himself over the side of the ledge, rolling a number of feet before he could break his fall.</p>

  <p class="normal">The men stood paralyzed as the flawless column picked up speed, smashed its way downward, hit the loading platform and broke into a hundred pieces on the road.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gilberto was leaning over Gino. Blood stained the marble-choked draw. Michelangelo went on his knees before the boy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"His neck is broken," said Gilberto.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He is still alive?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. Killed instantly."</p>

  <p class="normal">In his mind Michelangelo heard the mournful sound of a horn echoing from peak to peak. He picked up Gino's dead body, stumbled blindly the rest of the descent down the white passage. Someone brought his mule to the loading station. Michelangelo mounted, still holding Gino, while the others led the funeral procession into Seravezza.</p>

  <p class="chapter">11.</p>

  <p class="normal">The death of the boy lay heavy on his conscience. He took to his bed, sick at heart. Torrential rains inundated the piazza. All work was shut down. Vieri closed his books. The crews returned home. Michelangelo's accounting showed that he had spent thirty ducats beyond the eight hundred advanced to him at the beginning of the year for marble. He had loaded not a single block. The lone consolation was the attendance of a group of Carrarini quarriers and owners at Gino's burial. Apothecary Pelliccia linked his arm through Michelangelo's as they left the cemetery.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We're deeply sorry, Michelangelo. The death of the boy brought us to our senses. We treated you badly. But we too have suffered from the loss of contracts from agents and sculptors waiting to buy from the Pope's quarries."</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the Carrarini boatmen would transport his blocks, still sitting on the beach at Carrara, to the docks in Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">For several weeks he lay ill. The future looked blacker than the slate sky. He had failed in the task assigned to him; spent the monies advanced, used up the year fruitlessly. What happened now? Neither Pope Leo nor Cardinal Giulio had much patience with bunglers.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took a letter from his friend Salviati, late in October, to set him back on his feet:</p>

  <p class="block1">I am sorry to hear that you are so distressed about this thing; in such an undertaking you might happen to meet much worse accidents. Believe me that you are going to lack nothing, and God is going to repay you for this accident. Remember when you complete this work, our city will be gratefully obliged to you and to all of your family, and will be under eternal obligation. Great and honest men take more courage in adversities and become stronger.</p>

  <p class="normal">His fear that the Pope and cardinal might condemn him for the failure was allayed by a letter from Buoninsegni in Rome, who wrote:</p>

  <p class="block1">The Holy Father and His Lordship are very satisfied that there is a large quantity of marble. They wish the matter hurried as much as possible.</p>

  <p class="normal">A few days later he made the trip alone on horseback to the end of his road, then climbed Monte Altissimo to Vincarella. The sun had come out, the air was filled with autumnal scents. At the quarry he found tools in the wooden shed, marked vertically with hammer and heavy chisel the four columns to be dug out of the mountain as soon as he could return with quarriers. He returned to Pietrasanta, put his few personal possessions in a saddlebag and made his way down the coast to Pisa, then through the rolling valley of the Arno, the Duomo displacing space on the horizon from miles away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Florence knew about the accident, but only as a delaying mishap. Though some of the returning workers had complained about his driving them too hard, others praised him for the speed with which he had completed the road and extracted the first marble block ever quarried above Pietrasanta. He was still too shaken to attempt even the simplest carving, and so he settled for a more salutary work, the building of his new studio on the land he had bought on the Via Mozza. This time he did not design a house with a workshop attached, but rather a spacious high-ceilinged studio with a couple of small rooms added for living purposes.</p>

  <p class="normal">When his plan grew too large for the lot he went to Fattucci, chaplain of Santa Maria del Fiore, and again tried to get the piece of land at the rear. The chaplain replied:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope has issued a bull saying that all church lands must be sold at the highest possible price."</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned home, wrote to Cardinal Giulio:</p>

  <p class="block1">Now if the Pope makes bulls enabling one to steal, I beg Your Lordship have one made for me also.</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Giulio was amused; but Michelangelo ended by paying the full price for the extra strip. He plunged into the building of his home with hurricane activity, hiring workmen, buying his planks and nails from Puccione, the carpenter, mortar from Ugolino, the kiln man, his roof tiles from Maso, fir trees from Capponi. He hired <i class="calibre2">contadini </i>to bring his sand, gravel and stone, remained on the job all day to supervise. At night be kept his accounts as straight as Vieri had kept the books in Pietrasanta, jotting down the names of witnesses who were present when he paid Talosi for putting in the stone window frames, Baggiana, the sand-bearer, Ponti for five hundred large bricks, the widow who lived next door for half of her protecting wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">Trying to be, for once, as good a businessman as Jacopo Galli, Balducci and Salviati would have liked, he took over from the ailing Buonarroto the listings of the modest income from the properties he had bought over the years....</p>

  <p class="block1">I note hereafter the income I had in three years from the <i class="calibre2">podere </i>tilled by Bastiano called Balene (whales), <i class="calibre2">podere </i>that I purchased from Piero Tedaldi. In the first year: twenty-seven barrels of wine, eight barrels of oil and four bushels of wheat. In the second year: twenty-four barrels of wine, no oil, eight bushels of wheat. In the third year: ten barrels of oil, thirty-five barrels of wine, five bushels of wheat.</p>

  <p class="normal">The winter was mild. By February his tile roof had been set, the doors hung, the high northern windows framed, the bronze caster had delivered four bronze pulleys for the studio. He brought half a dozen of his nine-foot Carrara blocks for Julius' tomb from the Arno storehouse, set them upright so that he could study them. His workshop completed, he had only to return to Pietrasanta, excavate the columns he needed for San Lorenzo; then he could settle down on the Via Mozza for years of concentrated work for the Medici and Roveres.</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not ask Gilberto Topolino to go back to the quarries, that would have been unfair; but most of the others agreed to join him, including a new group of stonemasons. Rather than being frightened by Pietrasanta, the masons felt that with the road completed and the quarries opened the hardest work was already done. He took with him from Florence the needed supplies: heavy-duty rope, cables, sledge hammers and chisels. Still disturbed by the unexplained accident that had killed Gino, he evolved a system of iron lewis rings which could be driven into the surface of the block, giving the crews a surer grip on the marble as it was brought down the ravine. Lazzero said he could make the rings on his forge. Michelangelo sent Benti into Pisa to buy the best iron he could find.</p>

  <p class="normal">In good time they detached the marble from the mountain vertically, letting the blocks roll onto the <i class="calibre2">poggio. </i>The Pope had been rightly informed: there was enough magnificent marble here to supply the world for a thousand years. And now with the white walls exposed, all loose earth, rock, dirt, shale cleaned from above by two <i class="calibre2">tecchiaioli, </i>the crystalline cliffs yielded superbly.</p>

  <p class="normal">He hesitated to take the columns down the slide without the iron grips, but Pelliccia came to the diggings, recommended that he double his nest of outspread stakes along the trail, use heavier rope, and impede the downward movement by lessening the number of rollers.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were no more accidents. In the ensuing weeks he directed five superb blocks down the canal, onto the wagon, down the road behind the thirty-two bulls, past Seravezza, Pietrasanta, across the marsh, and onto the beach. Here the low barges would be brought up close, their decks filled with sand until they sank low in the water; the columns would be raised onto the sand fill, then the sand washed out through the scuppers until the marble blocks settled down securely on the deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the end of April, Lazzero finished his set of rings. Michelangelo, in a state of exultation over the beauty of his glorious white columns, was relieved at this added protection. Now, with the sixth column ready to be moved, he saw to it that the iron rings were firmly attached to hold the massive weight, making it possible to lessen the bulk of rope.</p>

  <p class="normal">The improvement was his undoing. Halfway down the ravine a ring snapped, the column got away, picking up so much speed that it jumped the bank of the ravine and went crashing down the steepest slope of Monte Altissimo to the river below, breaking to bits on the stony bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo recovered from his moment of stupefaction, saw that no one was hurt, then examined the broken ring. It had been made of poor iron.</p>

  <p class="normal">He climbed swiftly up the side of the ravine, took a heavy hammer and hit the iron connections of the hoisting cranes Lazzero had made. They broke under his blows like dry clay. It was a wonder the entire crew had not been killed long before this.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Benti!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where was this iron bought?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...in Pisa... like you said..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I gave you money to buy the best. There is not as much iron in here as there is in the rib of a knife."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...I... I'm sorry," stuttered Donate Benti, "but I... I didn't go. Lazzero went. I had faith in him."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned toward the shed where the smith was working a bellows over his forge.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Lazzero! Why did you not buy the best iron, as I ordered?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...this was cheaper."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Cheaper? You charged me the full price."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lazzero shrugged. <i class="calibre2">"Mah! </i>What would you? Every man uses a chance to make a few scudi."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A few scudi! To smash a column worth a hundred ducats. To endanger the life of every man working here. How could you be so... so venal?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Lazzero shrugged again; he did not know what venal meant.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is lost? One column. There are a thousand more just like it. Dig out another."</p>

  <p class="normal">As quickly as the news could reach the Vatican, and a letter of instructions be sent to the Board of the Wool Guild, Michelangelo was recalled to Florence. A foreman from the Duomo was sent to replace him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo rode his horse into Florence late the following afternoon. He was to report at once to Cardinal Giulio in the Medici palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">The palace was in mourning. Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, who had married Piero's son Lorenzo, had died in childbirth. Lorenzo, rising from a sickbed to ride from the Medici villa at Careggi to Poggio a Caiano, caught a fever, and had died only the day before. This removed the last legitimate heir descended from the male side of the Cosimo de' Medici line, though there were now two more illegitimate Medici: Ippolito, son of the dead Giuliano, and Alessandro, rumored to be the son of Cardinal Giulio.</p>

  <p class="normal">The palace was also sad because rumor had it that Pope Leo's extravagances had nearly bankrupted the Vatican. The Florentine bankers financing him were in serious trouble.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo put on fresh linens, packed his ledger and took the beloved walk through the Florentine streets, up the Via Ghibellina to the Via del Proconsolo, past the Duomo into the Street of the Watermelons with the House of the Five Lamps on the left, into the Via de' Calderai with its coppersmiths and cuirass-makers, across the Via Larga to the Medici palace. Cardinal Giulio, sent by Leo to take over the reins, was saying a requiem mass in the Benozzo Gozzoli chapel. When it was concluded, and everyone had filed out, Michelangelo expressed his regret at young Lorenzo's death. The cardinal did not appear to hear him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your Grace, why have you recalled me? In a matter of months I would have had all nine of my giant columns on the beach of Pietrasanta."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is enough marble now."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was unnerved by an undertone of hostility in the cardinal's voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Enough...? I don't understand."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are abandoning the façade for San Lorenzo."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned white, speechless.</p>

  <p class="normal">Giulio continued: "The floor of the Duomo needs repaving. Since the Duomo and Wool Guild Boards paid the cost of the road, they are entitled to the marbles you have excavated."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt as though the cardinal had walked over his prostrate body in boots covered with dung.</p>

  <p class="normal">"To pave the Duomo floor? With my marbles? With the finest statuary marbles ever quarried! Why do you humiliate me in this way?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Giulio answered idily, "Marble is marble. It should be used for what is needed next. Right now the cathedral needs paving blocks."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo clenched his fists to stop his trembling, gazed at Gozzoli's exquisite portrait of <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico </i>and his brother Giuliano, on the wall of the chapel.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is nearly three years now since His Holiness and Your Grace took me off the Rovere tomb. In all that time I have not been able to carve one inch of marble. Of the twenty-three hundred ducats you have sent me, I have spent eighteen hundred on the marbles, quarries and roads. On the Pope's instructions I had the marbles for Julius' tomb shipped here, so that I could carve them while I worked the San Lorenzo façade. To send them to Rome now, the shipment will cost me more than the five hundred ducats' difference! I do not reckon the costs of the wooden model I made; I do not reckon the three years I have wasted in this work; I do not reckon the great insult put upon me by being brought here to do this work, and then having it taken from me; I do not reckon my house in Rome, which I left, and where marbles, furniture and blocked-out statues have suffered upwards of another five hundred ducats. I will not reckon all these things, regardless of the terrible loss to me. I only want one thing now: to be free!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Giulio had listened carefully to Michelangelo's catalogue of complaints. His thin, smooth face grew dark.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Holy Father will review these doings at the proper time. You are dismissed."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stumbled down the long hallway, his feet carrying him to what had been <i class="calibre2">Il Magnifico's studiolo. </i>He thrust open the door, entered, stared at the room. He cried aloud to the long-departed spirit of Lorenzo:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am ruined!"</p>
