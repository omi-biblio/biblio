  <h1>BOOK SEVEN:<br/>The Pope</h1>

  <p class="normal">He had no way of knowing, during his stay in the mountains of Carrara, that his years of grace were over. He returned to Rome in time for Julius' New Year's reception of 1506, and to unload the boats as they arrived at the Ripa Grande, only to find that the war between himself and the Pope had begun. Bramante had persuaded Julius to abandon Sangallo's idea for a separate chapel to house his tomb; instead, a new St. Peter's was to rise on the hill where the chapel was to have gone, the best design to be chosen through public competition. Michelangelo heard of no provision for his tomb. He had spent the Pope's entire thousand ducats for marbles and shipping, but Julius refused to give him more money until he had seen one of the statues carved. When Julius provided him with a house behind the Piazza San Pietro, a papal secretary informed him that he would have to pay several ducats a month for its use.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could I wait until I am paid something by the Holy Father before I return his rent money?" he asked caustically.</p>

  <p class="normal">He went to the docks in a gray January overcast, accompanied by Piero Rosselli, a Livorno muralist who was known as the best preparer of walls for fresco. A peppery, freckle-faced chap who had gone to sea as a youth, Rosselli walked along the quays with a swaying movement as though to accommodate a rolling deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've fought this current many times in winter," said Rosselli, looking downstream at the swollen Tiber; "it'll be days before a boat can make its way up here."</p>

  <p class="normal">Back at Sangallo's house, Michelangelo warmed his hands before the library fire while his old friend showed him his finished designs for the new St. Peter's, incorporating the Old Basilica. Sangallo believed that he had overcome the objections of the Sacred College and the public to replacing the original church.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you don't think Bramante has a chance to win the competition?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He has talent," replied Sangallo; "his Tempietto in San Pietro in Montorio is a gem. But he has had no experience in building churches."</p>

  <p class="normal">Francesco Sangallo broke into the room, crying, "Father! They've unearthed a big marble statue in the old palace of Emperor Titus. His Holiness wants you to go at once and supervise excavating it."</p>

  <p class="normal">A crowd had already gathered in the vineyard behind Santa Maria Maggiore. In a hollow, the bottom half still submerged, gleamed a magnificent bearded head and a torso of tremendous power. Through one arm, and turning around the opposite shoulder, was a serpent; on either side emerged the heads, arms and shoulders of two youths, encircled by the same serpent. Michelangelo's mind flashed back to his first night in Lorenzo's <i>studiolo.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"It is the Laocoön," Sangallo cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of which Pliny wrote!" added Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">The carving was over eight feet in height and equally long, an awesome sight. When the news spread through Rome the vineyard and streets and steps of Santa Maria Maggiore became jammed with high church officials, merchants, noblemen, all hoping to acquire the prize. The farmer who owned the land announced that he had sold the statue to a cardinal for four hundred ducats. The Vatican's Master of Ceremonies, Paris de Grassis, offered five hundred. The farmer yielded. Paris de Grassis turned to Sangallo. "His Holiness asks that you bring it to the Papal palace immediately." Then, to Michelangelo, he added, "He requests your attendance this afternoon to examine the block."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope had ordered the Laocoön set up on the closed terrace of the Belvedere pavilion, across a valley and on the hill above the Papal palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wish you to examine the figures minutely," said Julius, "and tell me if they are truly carved from one block."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo began working the statue, front and back, with sharp eyes and sensitive finger tips, finding four vertical junctures where separate pieces of marble had been joined together by the sculptors of Rhodes.</p>

  <p class="normal">He left the Belvedere, walked to the bank that had been Jacopo Galli's. How different Rome felt without Galli in it; how desperately he needed his friend's counsel now. Baldassare Balducci was the new manager-owner of the bank. His family in Florence had invested in Rome, as had many members of the Florentine colony; Balducci had seized the opportunity to marry the plain-faced daughter of a wealthy Roman family, with a considerable dowry.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do you do with your Sundays now, Balducci?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Balducci flushed. "I spend them with my wife's family."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't you miss the exercise?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I still go hunting... with a gun. The owner of a bank has to be respectable."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Che rigorista! </span></i><span>I never expected to find you conventional."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Balducci sighed. "You can't grow rich and amuse yourself at the same time. One's youth should be spent on women, his middle years on money, his old age on bowling."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You've become quite a philosopher. Could you lend me a hundred ducats?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood in the wind-driven rain watching the boat with his marbles struggle to make its way to the docks. Twice the prow went under the whitecaps. It seemed that the boat and its precious cargo would sink to the bottom of the swollen Tiber, carrying with it thirty-four wagonloads of his best quarried marbles. While he stood drenched on the riverbank, the sailors made a last frenzied effort; ropes were thrown from the docks, the boat tied up. The job of unloading in the torrential downpour was nearly impossible. He helped carry ten of the smaller blocks off the bobbing boat which the current whipped away from its lashing several times, but he was unable to move the six-, ten-, and twelve-foot columns until Sangallo came to direct the use of a loading crane.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dark fell before the job was completed. He lay awake listening to the storm increase in fury. When he reached the docks in the morning he found that the Tiber had overflowed. The Ripa Grande was a marsh. His beautiful marbles were covered with mud and yellow silt. He waded through water up to his knees to clean off the loose debris, remembering the months he had spent in the quarries searching for the purest bed, supervising the cutting of the big blocks from the mountainside, lowering them down the precipitous slopes on cables and rollers, loading them on wagons which took them to the beach, rolling them gently over the sand onto the boats at low tide, all without a chip or crack or stain. And look at them now, after the barest few hours in Rome!</p>

  <p class="normal">It took three days for the rain to stop and the Tiber to recede from the quay. The Guffatti sons came with the family wagon to carry the marbles to the rear portico of the house. Michelangelo paid them out of the loan from Balducci, then bought a large tarpaulin to cover the blocks, and some used furniture. On the last day of January, surrounded by his wet and stained marbles, he sat down at the plank table and wrote his father a letter, enclosing a note to Argiento, which he asked Lodovico to send on to the farm at Ferrara, where Argiento had gone when the Signoria reclaimed Michelangelo's house until he could resume work for them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pending Argiento's arrival, Sangallo recommended an elderly carpenter by the name of Cosimo, with a thin thatch of silver hair and rheumy eyes, who needed lodgings. His cooking tasted of resin and shavings, but Cosimo in a methodical fashion helped Michelangelo build a wooden model of the first two floors of the tomb. Twice a week young Rosselli would go to the fish markets at the Portico of Octavia to buy fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, squid and sea bass, cooking a Livornese <i>cacciucco, </i>or fish stew, over Michelangelo's fire. The three men mopped up the spicy oregano sauce with crusts of bread.</p>

  <p class="normal">To buy a forge, Swedish iron and chestnut wood, it was necessary for him to visit Balducci's bank to borrow another hundred ducats.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't mind making a second loan," said Balducci. "But I do mind your getting deeper into the hole. When do you expect to put this tomb on a businesslike basis?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"As soon as I have some carving to show Julius. First I must decorate several of the base blocks, to establish models for Argiento and a stonecarver I'm planning to bring from the Duomo workshop. Then I can start massing the Moses..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But that could take months! What do you intend to live on until then? Be sensible, go to the Pope. From a bad paymaster, get what you can."</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned home, measured Cosimo's wooden model for the size of the block at the corner of the tomb, then cut a marble to shape, carving a series of three masks, two in profile, a full face below, surrounded by flowing calligraphic lines. That was as far as he got: three structural support blocks. Argiento sent no word in response to his letter. The stonemason from the Duomo workyard could not come. Sangallo did not think it a good time to ask the Pope for money.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Holy Father is judging the plans for St. Peter's. The winner is to be announced on March first. At that time I will take you to His Holiness."</p>

  <p class="normal">But on the first of March the Sangallo palace fell silent. When Michelangelo arrived at the house he found it deserted, not even the draftsmen having come to work. Sangallo, his wife and son were huddled together in an upstairs bedroom as though someone in the family had died.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How could this have happened?" cried Michelangelo. "You are the Pope's official architect. You are one of his oldest and most loyal friends."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All I hear is rumor: the Romans around the Pope hate all Florentines, but they are friendly to Urbino, and hence to Bramante. Others say he makes the Holy Father laugh, hunts with him, entertains him..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Clowns! Do they build great churches?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They ingratiate themselves..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will get the truth from Leo Baglioni."</p>

  <p class="normal">Baglioni gazed at him in genuine astonishment. "The truth? Don't you know the truth? Come with me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante had bought an old palace in the Borgo, close to the Vatican, torn it down and rebuilt it with simple elegance. The house was jammed with important personages of Rome: courtiers from the Vatican, princes of the Church, nobles, professors, artists, merchants, bankers. Bramante held court, the center of all eyes and admiration, his red face beaming, the green eyes crackling with excitement and triumph.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leo Baglioni steered Michelangelo upstairs to a large workroom. Pinned to the walls and scattered about the worktables were Bramante's drawings for the new St. Peter's. Michelangelo gasped: it was an edifice to dwarf the cathedral of Florence, yet of an elegant, lyrical design, noble in its conception. By comparison Sangallo's Byzantine conception, a dome over a square, seemed ponderous and fortress-like.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Michelangelo knew the truth: it had nothing to do with the Romans hating Florentines or Bramante being an entertainer. It had to do with talent. Bramante's St. Peter's was the more beautiful and modern in every aspect.</p>

  <p class="normal">'Tm sorry for Sangallo's sake," said Baglioni matter-of-factly, "but this was a competition, and there's no doubt in anyone's mind who won it. What would you do, if you were the Pope? Award the commission to a friend and build a church that was outmoded before it began? Or give it to a newcomer, and create the most beautiful church in Christendom?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo did not trust himself to answer. He fled down the steps, out into the Borgo, circled the Leonine Wall until he was drugged with exhaustion. If he, Michelangelo Buonarroti, had been Pope Julius II, he too would have been obliged to choose Bramante's plan. This church, far more than the paved streets and enlarged piazzas, could be the beginning of a new and glorious Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night, as he lay cold and sleepless in his bed, listening to Cosimo snore as though each breath were his last, it became obvious to him that Bramante, from the moment the Pope had sent him with them to find a proper spot for the tomb, had laid his plans to see that the special chapel would never be built. He had used Sangallo's idea for a separate building, and Michelangelo's grandiose plan for the mausoleum, for his own purpose: the securing of a commission to build a new cathedral.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no question but that Bramante's St. Peter's would be a glorious abode for the tomb. But would Bramante allow it in his church? Would he be willing to share credit and attention with Michelangelo Buonarroti?</p>

  <p class="chapter">2.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the middle of March the sun came out. Michelangelo had the Guffatti family set three giant columns upright. Soon he would be ready to remove the negative marble and probe for the Moses and the Captives. On April first it was announced that the Pope and Bramante would lay the cornerstone of the new cathedral on April 18. Paris de Grassis was busy establishing protocol. When the workmen began digging the wide hole which the Pope was to descend to bless the laying of the first stone, Michelangelo saw that the sacred old basilica was not to be included in the new structure, but would be demolished piecemeal to make room for the new church.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was outspoken in his disapproval. He loved the columns and ancient carvings; he also felt that it was sacrilege to destroy the earliest temple of Christendom in Rome. He spoke of it with whomever he met, until Leo Baglioni warned him that some of Bramante's less savory hangers-on were saying that unless he stopped attacking their friend his tomb might be built before that of the Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wouldn't want you turning up in the Tiber, my unpolitic young friend," laughed Leo.</p>

  <p class="normal">He received a letter from the man who owned the boats in Carrara, advising him that another shipment of marbles would reach the Ripa Grande early in May. Michelangelo would have to make payment at the docks before the marbles could be released. The bill was for more ducats than he had. He washed, went to the Papal palace. Pope Julius, his bristling beard protruding from a high ermine collar, was in his small throne room surrounded by courtiers. Beside him was his favorite jeweler. Julius turned on the man, cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I do not mean to spend a <i>baiocco </i>more for stones, small or great."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo waited until the gem cutter had retired and the Pope seemed calmer, then pressed forward.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, the next shipment of your marbles for the tomb are on the way. The boat charges must be paid before I can have them carried home. I am without funds to meet the bill. Could you give me expense money to secure the blocks?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Return Monday," said the Pope curtly, and turned away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rome was beautiful in the butter-yellow spring sunlight; but Michelangelo walked the streets blindly, a torrent raging in his head. He had been dismissed like the tradesman! Why? Because that was all an artist was, a skilled tradesman? But the Pope had called him the best marble master in all Italy.</p>

  <p class="normal">He took his story to Baglioni, asking if his friend knew what had caused the change in the Holy Father. Leo had trouble keeping his voice matter-of-fact.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bramante has convinced the Pope that it is bad luck to build one's own tomb. That it could hasten the day when it has to be pressed into service."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sank onto a wooden bench, breathing hard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What shall I do?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Go back on Monday. As though nothing had happened."</p>

  <p class="normal">He went back on Monday. Then on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Each time he was admitted, received coolly, told to return. On Friday the guard at the Papal palace refused him entrance. It was hot in the midday sun, but Michelangelo felt cold all over. Thinking there might be some misunderstanding, he again tried to enter the palace. His way was barred. At that moment the Pope's cousin, the Bishop of Lucca, arrived.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is the matter with you?" cried the bishop to the guard. "Do you not know Maestro Buonarroti?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know him, Your Grace."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then why are you sending him away?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Excuse me, Excellency, but I have my orders."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo walked home, his shoulders jerking as though in spasms. His brain was on fire. He quickened his pace, without actually running, bolted the door of his house, sat down and scrawled:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Most Blessed Father, I have been turned out of the palace today by your orders; therefore, if you want me, you must look for me elsewhere than in Rome.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">He addressed the letter to Messer Agostino, the Pope's steward, sent a neighboring boy to find Cosimo. The old man came hurrying.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Cosimo, I must leave Rome tonight. Tomorrow send for a dealer and sell this furniture."</p>

  <p class="normal">At the second hour of the night he rented a horse at the Porta del Popolo and left with the post for Florence. At the rise north of town, where he had caught his first glimpse of Rome, he turned in the saddle to gaze back at the sleeping city. Into his mind came a favorite Tuscan adage, born of centuries of feuding:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>How much the fool who goes to Rome</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Excels the fool who stays at home.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Early the second day he dropped off his horse at Poggibonsi at the inn where he had stopped on his way to Siena to recarve Torrigiani's St. Francis. He was washing in a bowl near the wall when he heard thunderous hoofs storming up the road. It turned out to be Baglioni at the head of a party of five couriers, their horses lathering at the bit from hard riding. He stood gazing at his fastidious friend's face, covered with dried perspiration, his clothes discolored by the dust of the road.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leo! What brings you to Poggibonsi?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You! The Holy Father knew we were friends. He ordered me to head the party."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo blinked at the five armed men of the Pope's guard sitting their horses and glaring at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What... party? I'm on my way home to Florence...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, you're not!" Baglioni dismounted, brushed the hair out of his eyes. He took a parchment from his saddlebag. "This is a letter from Pope Julius. He commands you to return forthwith to Rome under penalty of disgrace...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I did not deserve to be driven from his presence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All will be set to rights."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Permit me to doubt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have the Holy Father's word for it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Holy Father has lapses of memory."</p>

  <p class="normal">A burly horseman asked, "Shall we truss him up, Messer Baglioni? We could sling him over his own saddle."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was not instructed to use force. Michelangelo, you're not the first to be kept waiting by a Pope. If Julius says, 'Wait!' you wait, if it takes a week, a month or a year."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm going back to Florence for good."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not for good. Nobody leaves the Pope dangling! Upon my oath, the Holy Father is sorry about what happened. He wants you to return and resume work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will not allow any man to treat me as dirt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope is not 'any man.'" Leo came close, <i>so </i>the guards could not hear, said, "Bravo! You sound like the Florentine Marzocco. But now that you have asserted your independence, come back. Do not put me in a difficult position."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was silent; Baglioni had always been a good friend. But what about his own self-respect? No one should ask another man to surrender his pride. He told Leo so. Baglioni's face became stern.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not possible to defy the pontiff. You will see. Now or later. And later could be worse. As your friend I urge you not to match your will against his. How could you win?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo lowered his head, crinkled his eyes and studied the pattern of the earth beneath his feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know, Leo.... But if I return now I lose everything. I'm going on to Florence to get my house and my contract back. If he wishes it I'll sculpture the Pope's tomb... under the shadow of the Signoria tower."</p>

  <p class="chapter">3.</p>

  <p class="normal">His father was not pleased to see him; he had imagined Michelangelo to be earning large sums from the Pope in Rome. He took over his front room again, set Taddei's Our Lady on a workstand, checked his marble for the Apostle Matthew where it was stored in a Duomo workshed, carried home from the foundry the still unfinished bronze David. His cartoon for the Bathers had been moved from the Dyers' Hall, mounted on a fir-tree frame and attached to the wall of the gallery beyond the Great Hall of the Palazzo della Signoria.</p>

  <p class="normal">The news of the exchange in the yard of the Poggibonsi inn took only a few hours to make its way over the mountain. When he and Granacci reached Rustici's studio for supper with the Company, he found himself a hero.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What a tremendous compliment Pope Julius has paid you!" cried Botticelli, who had painted frescoes in the Sistine Chapel for Julius' uncle, Pope Sixtus IV, "to send an armed recovery party after you. When has this ever happened to an artist?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Never," growled <i>Il Cronaca. </i>"One artist is like another; if he vanishes, there are a dozen to take his place."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But here is the Pope acknowledging that an artist is an individual," added Rustici excitedly. "With special talents and gifts, not to be found in exactly the same combination in anyone else in the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt more put upon than a hero.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What else could I have done?" he cried, as Granacci shoved a glass of wine into his hand. "I was barred from the Vatican..."</p>

  <p class="normal">The following morning Michelangelo was awakened to the fact that the Florentine government did not agree with the Company of the Cauldron on the beneficent effects of his revolt. Gonfaloniere Soderini's face was grave when he received Michelangelo in his office.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm apprehensive about what you did. At Rome, as the Pope's sculptor, you could be of considerable help to Florence. Defying him, you become a source of potential danger to us. You're the first Florentine to defy a Pope since Savonarola. I'm afraid your fate will be about the same."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You mean I'll be hanged from a gibbet in the piazza, and then burned?" He shivered involuntarily.</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini smiled for the first time, wobbling the end of his nose.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are not guilty of heresy, only of disobedience. But in the end the Pope will have his way."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Gonfaloniere, all I want to do is settle down in Florence. I'll start carving the St. Matthew tomorrow so that I can have my house back."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini's skin went as yellow-white as his hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Florence cannot renew your sculpture contract now. His Holiness would consider it a personal affront. No one can employ you, not Doni, or Pitti or Taddei, without incurring the Pope's enmity. Not until you complete Julius II's tomb, or the Holy Father releases you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would it embarrass you if I were to complete existing contracts?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Finish the David. Our ambassador in Paris keeps writing that the king is irritated with us because we do not send the statue."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And the Bathers; can I do the fresco?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini looked up at him. "You have not been in the Great Hall?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The groom brought me through your apartment."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I suggest you go out that way."</p>

  <p class="normal">He went directly to the east side of the Council platform where Leonardo da Vinci had painted the Battle of Anghiari. The back of his hand swung up to his mouth.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Dio mio, </span></i><span>no!"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The entire lower half of Leonardo's fresco was in ruin, the colors having run as sharply downward as though pulled by powerful magnets: horses, men, spears, trees, rocks, having flowed into each other in an indistinguishable chaos of color. All the antagonism, the quarrels, the feuds washed away in whatever solvent had destroyed Leonardo's magnificent mural. Michelangelo felt only the deepest regret for a fellow artist who had created mightily for a whole year of his life, only to have the results wiped out. What could have gone wrong? Tuscans had been the masters of fresco for over three hundred years. He felt Soderini at his shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Gonfaloniere, how did it happen?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leonardo was determined to revive ancient encaustic painting. He took the recipe for the plaster from Pliny, used wax with a solvent, and then gum to harden the mixture. When be finished, he applied heat by lighting fires on the floor. He said he had tried it on a small mural in Santa Maria Novella, and it had worked well. But this mural is twenty-two feet high, and in order for the heat to reach the upper portion, he had to heap on the fuel. The intense heat on the lower half caused the wax to run... and pulled all the colors down with it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo lived in the San Giovanni quarter. Michelangelo knocked on the clapper. A servant answered. He was ushered into a large, beam-ceilinged room filled with art works, musical instruments, tapestries, oriental rugs. Leonardo, in a Chinese-red robe, was writing in a notebook at a high ledgerlike desk. He looked up, saw Michelangelo, put the notebook into a drawer and locked it with a key. He came forward, limping markedly from a fall he had sustained in his flying machine on a hill near Fiesole. An edge of his shining beauty had faded from his face, his eyes held a touch of melancholy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leonardo, I've just come from the Signoria. I want you to know how sorry I am about the fresco. I, too, have just wasted a year of my life, so I know what it must mean to you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are kind." Leonardo's voice was cool.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But that was not my main purpose in coming. I wanted to apologize to you... for my crustiness... for the wretched things I have said about you, about the statue in Milan..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You were provoked. I said slighting things about marble carvers."</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo was beginning to thaw. Color had returned to the alabaster skin.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I saw your cartoon for the Bathers while you were away. It is truly magnificent. I sketched from it, even as I did from your David. It will become a glory of Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know. I've lost all appetite now that your Battle of Anghiari will not be fought beside mine."</p>

  <p class="normal">If he had straightened out an enmity, he was endangering his most valuable friendship. Gonfaloniere Soderini sent for him two days later to read to him from a letter from the Pope, demanding that the Signoria return Michelangelo Buonarroti to Rome at once, under pain of pontifical displeasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Looks as if I had better keep going north," replied Michelangelo mournfully; "maybe to France. Then I will no longer be your responsibility."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You can't run from the Pope. His arm reaches over all Europe."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why am I so precious to the Holy Father in Florence? He locked me out in Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because in Rome you were an employee who could be ignored. Having repudiated his service, you become the most desirable artist in the world. Don't push him too far."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm not pushing anybody," Michelangelo cried in anguish; "I just want to be let alone."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Too late. The time for that was before you entered Julius' service."</p>

  <p class="normal">On the next post he received a letter from Piero Rosselli which made him feel as though the curls over his forehead were dancing on his head like snakes. The Pope did not want him back in Rome to continue work on the marbles; Bramante definitely had the Holy Father convinced that the tomb would hasten his death. His Holiness now wanted Michelangelo to paint the vault of the Sistine Chapel, the ugliest, most clumsy, ill-conceived and Godforsaken piece of architecture in all Italy. He read and reread Rosselli's lines:</p>

  <p class="block2indent">Last Saturday evening, when the Pope was at supper, he called for Bramante and said: "Sangallo is going to Florence tomorrow, and will bring Michelangelo back with him." Bramante answered: "Holy Father, be will not be able to do anything of the kind. I have conversed with Michelangelo, and he has often told me that he would not undertake the chapel, which you wanted to put upon him; and that, you notwithstanding, he meant only to apply himself to sculpture, and would have nothing to do with painting. Holy Father, I do not think he has the courage to attempt the work, because he has small experience in painting figures, and these will be raised high above the line of vision. That is something different from painting on the ground."</p>

  <p class="block2indent">The Pope replied: "If he does not come, he will do me wrong; and so I think that he is sure to return." Upon this, I up and gave Bramante a sound rating in the Pope's presence, and spoke as I believe you would have spoken for me; and for the time he was struck dumb, as though he felt that he had made a mistake in talking as he did. I proceeded as follows: "Holy Father, Bramante never exchanged a word with Michelangelo, and if what he has just said is the truth, I beg you to cut my head off...."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo cried aloud, "Me talk with Bramante? It's a fantastic lie! Why would he want to tell the Pope such a story?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The letter threw Michelangelo into deeper turmoil. He could do no work at all. He set off for Settignano to sit silently and cut building blocks with the Topolinos, then visited Contessina and Ridolfi. The baby, Niccolò, now five, insisted that he too be taught how to "make the marble fly." He put in an occasional hour filing and burnishing the Maréchal bronze, went several times to the Great Hall in a futile effort to whip up enthusiasm for his fresco. He knew even before Gonfaloniere Soderini summoned him at the beginning of July that the coming months would be torn by strong winds from the south. Soderini began reading at once from the Pope's <i>breve:</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>"Michelangelo the sculptor, who left us without reason, and in mere caprice, is afraid, as we are informed, of returning, though we for our part are not angry with him, knowing the humors of such men of genius. In order then that he may lay aside all anxiety, we rely on your loyalty to convince him in our name, that if he returns to us, he shall be uninjured and unhurt, retaining our apostolic favor in the same measure as he formerly enjoyed it."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini put the letter down. "I'm going to have the Cardinal of Pavia write a letter by his own hand, in which he will promise you safety. Will that satisfy you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. Last night at the Salviati I met a Florentine merchant by the name of Tommaso di Tolfo who lives in Turkey. There is a chance for me to go out there and work for the Sultan."</p>

  <p class="normal">His brother Lionardo asked to see him by the brook at the foot of their field in Settignano. Lionardo sat on the Buonarroti bank, Michelangelo on the Topolino side, cooling their feet in the narrow creek.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, I want to help you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In what way?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let me first admit that I made mistakes in the early years. You were right in following your course. I have seen your Madonna and Child in Bruges. Our brothers in Rome speak reverently of your Pietà. You have been worshiping God too. Forgive my trespasses against you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are forgiven, Lionardo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I must explain to you that the Pope is the viceroy of God on earth. When you disobey His Holiness you disobey God."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Was that true," Michelangelo asked, "when Savonarola fought Alexander VI?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Lionardo let the black cowl slip forward to mask his eyes. "Savonarola disobeyed. No matter what we think of any one Pope, he is the descendant of St. Peter. If each of us were to judge him, the Church would fall into chaos."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Popes are men, Lionardo, elected to high office. I have to do what I feel is right."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're not afraid that God will punish you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked across the brook at his brother. "Every man's courage is important. I believe God loves independence more than He does servility."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You must be right," said Lionardo, his head lowered again, "or He would not help you carve such divine marbles."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lionardo rose, walked up the hill toward the Buonarroti house. Michelangelo climbed the opposite bank to the Topolinos'. From the top of the ridges they turned, waved to each other. They were never to meet again.</p>

  <p class="normal">The only one who was not frightened for him was Contessina, who was irreverent about Pope Julius. A daughter of one of the ruling dynasties of the world, she had seen her family driven out of the city it had helped make the greatest in Europe, had seen her home sacked by fellow townsmen who had loved and benefited from her family's efforts, had seen her father-in-law hanged from the Signoria, had been exiled for eight years in a peasant's cottage. Her respect for authority was fading.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her husband did not share these feelings. Ridolfi wanted to get to Rome. Therefore he did not wish to offend the Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is with reluctance, Buonarroti, that I must ask you not to come here again. It will be reported to the Pope. The Holy Father, through Cardinal Giovanni, is our last hope. We must not endanger it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina asked in a constrained voice, "Michelangelo could come here to visit during the years when he risked his position in Florence, but not now, when he is risking your position in Rome?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not my position, Contessina, ours. If the Pope turns against us... After all, Buonarroti had a trade; if Florence banishes him he can ply his craft elsewhere. Rome is the only place we have left to go. Our future depends on it, and that of our sons. It is too dangerous."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Being born into this world is the primary danger," observed Contessina, gazing head on at Michelangelo. "Everything after that is a game of seed cards."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will not come again, Messer Ridolfi," said Michelangelo quietly. "You must protect your family. It was thoughtless of me."</p>

  <p class="chapter">4.</p>

  <p class="normal">In late August Julius left Rome with an army of five hundred knights and nobles. He was joined by his nephew, the Duke of Urbino, at Orvieto, and made a bloodless conquest of Perugia. Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici was left in command of the city. The Pope was joined by the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua with a trained army, crossed the Apennines to avoid Rimini, which was held by a hostile Venice; bribed the Cardinal of Rouen out of the eight thousand French troops sent to protect Bologna by offering cardinalate hats to his three nephews; and publicly excommunicated Giovanni Bentivoglio, the ruler of Bologna. The Bolognese drove out Bentivoglio. Julius marched into Bologna.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet nothing sufficiently diverting had happened to Pope Julius II to make him forget his errant sculptor. At the Palazzo della Signoria, Soderini, flanked by the other eight members of the Signoria, shouted at Michelangelo as he entered:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have tried a bout with the Pope on which the King of France would not have ventured. We do not wish to go to war with the pontiff on your account! The Holy Father wants you to do some works in Bologna. Make up your mind to go!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo knew he was beaten. He had known for weeks, actually, for as the Pope advanced through Umbria, reconquering it for the Papal State, then Emilia, the people on the streets of Florence began turning their heads when he passed. Florence, which had no defense, so desperately needed the Pope's friendship that it had sent hired mercenaries, including Michelangelo's brother Sigismondo, to help him with his conquests. No one wanted the Pope's now swollen and confident army crossing the Apennines to attack. The Signoria, the townspeople, all were determined that he be sent back to the Pope, regardless of the consequences to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were right. Florence came first. He would go to Bologna, make his peace with the Holy Father as best he could. Soderini did not abandon him. He gave Michelangelo a letter to his brother, the Cardinal of Volterra, who was with the Pope:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>The bearer of this letter will be Michelangelo, sculptor, who is sent to you in compliance with the request of His Holiness. We assure Your Lordship that he is a good young man, and unique of his art in Italy, perhaps in the world. He is such that, using good words and kind manners, one can obtain everything from him; one must be tender and kind to him, and he will do such things that anyone who sees them will be amazed. Said Michelangelo comes upon my honor.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">By now it was November. The streets of Bologna were crowded with courtiers, soldiers, foreigners in colorful costumes who had thronged to the court of the Pope. In the Piazza Maggiore a monk was suspended in a wire cage from the Palazzo del Podestà, having been caught coming out of a house on the Street of the Bordellos.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo found a messenger to take his letter of protection to the Cardinal of Volterra, then mounted the steps of San Petronio, gazing in veneration at the Della Quercia Istrian stone sculptures of the Creation of Adam, the Expulsion from Paradise and the Sacrifices of Cain and Abel. How far he was from fulfilling his hope of carving these scenes in free-standing marble! He entered the church, where mass was being said, and was recognized by one of the Pope's body servants from Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Messer Buonarroti, His Holiness has been waiting impatiently."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope was at dinner in a palace, surrounded by his court of twenty-four cardinals, the generals of his army, the noblemen, knights, princes, perhaps a hundred at dinner in the banner-strewn hall. Michelangelo was escorted the length of the room by a bishop sent by the Cardinal of Volterra, who was ill. Pope Julius looked up, saw him, fell silent. So did the rest of the hall. Michelangelo stood by the side of the Pope's big chair, at the head of the table. The two men glared at each other, their eyes flashing fire. Michelangelo threw his shoulders back, refusing to kneel. The Pope was the first to speak.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have delayed long! We have been obliged to come to meet you!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo thought grimly that this was true: the Pope had traveled a good many more miles than he had. He said stubbornly, "Holy Father, I did not deserve the treatment I received in Rome in Easter week."</p>

  <p class="normal">The silence deepened in the big ball. The bishop, attempting to intervene in Michelangelo's behalf, stepped forward.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, one must be indulgent toward this race of artists. They understand nothing, outside their trade, and often lack good manners."</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius rose from his chair, thundered:</p>

  <p class="normal">"How dare you say to this man things that I myself would not say? It is you who lack manners!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The bishop stood dumfounded, unable to move. The Pope gave a signal. Several courtiers seized the terror-stricken prelate and ushered him from the hall with a rain of blows. Having received as close to a public apology as a Pope could proffer, Michelangelo knelt, kissed the Pope's ring, murmured his own regrets. The Pope bestowed his benediction, said, "Come to my camp tomorrow. We will arrange our affairs."</p>

  <p class="normal">At dusk he sat before a fire in Aldovrandi's library. Aldovrandi, who had been sent as ambassador to Julius on two earlier occasions, and had been appointed by the Pope as a ruling member of the Council of Forty, could not stop chuckling at the happenings in the dining hall. His fair skin and jovial eyes looked as young as Michelangelo remembered them from ten years before.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're so much alike," he commented, "you and Julius. You both have a <i>terribilità, </i>a terrifying awesomeness. I'm sure you are the only one in Christendom who would have thought of reproaching the pontiff after having openly defied him for seven months. No wonder he respects you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo pulled on the steaming mug of hot water flavored with brown sugar that Signora Aldovrandi had brought against the end-of-November cold.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do you suppose the Holy Father intends to do with me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Put you to work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"At what?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He'll think of something. You'll stay with us, of course?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo accepted with pleasure. Later as they sat over supper, he asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"How is your nephew Marco?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Quite well. He has a new girl, one he found in Rimini two summers ago during the <i>ferragosto, </i>the mid-August holiday."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And Clarissa?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"One of the Bentivoglio uncles... adopted her. When he had to flee with Giovanni Bentivoglio, she leased her villa to one of the Pope's courtiers for a handsome rental."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you know where I can find her?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I believe in the Via di Mezzo di San Martino. She has an apartment there."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you excuse me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi rose, murmured, "Love and a cough cannot be hid."</p>

  <p class="normal">She stood in the open doorway of the roof penthouse overlooking the Piazza di San Martino, silhouetted against the orange glow of the oil lamps behind her, her face framed in the fur cowl of a woolen robe. They stared at each other in silence, as he and the Pope had, though with a rather different emotion. His mind went back to the first time he had seen her, when she was nineteen, slender, golden-haired, with an undulant softness of manner, her lithe, willowy figure moving with delicate sensuousness, the beauty of her neck and shoulders and bosom recalling Botticelli's Simonetta. Now she was thirty-one, at a lush peak of ripeness, only a little heavier, a little less scintillating. Again he was aware of her magnificent body through every pore of his own. She spoke with the same sibilance of voice that seemed to enter his every orifice, making it difficult for him to separate the words because of the pounding in his ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The last thing I told you was, 'Bologna is on the road to everywhere.' Come in."</p>

  <p class="normal">She led him into a small sitting room, warmed by two braziers, then turned to him. He slipped his arms inside her fur-lined robe. Her body was warm from the soft fur. He held her to him, kissed her yielding mouth. She murmured: "When I first said, 'It is natural for us to want each other,' you blushed like a boy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Artists know nothing of love. My friend Granacci describes it as a diversion."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How would you describe it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What I feel for you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes."</p>

  <p class="normal">"As a torrent... that hurtles a man's body down through rocky canyons, sweeps him along at flood tide..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And then?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...I can talk no more...."</p>

  <p class="normal">The robe came undone, slipped off her shoulders. She raised her arms, released a few pins and the long braids of golden hair fell to her waist. There was no voluptuousness in her movements, but rather the quality he remembered of sweetness, as though love were her natural medium.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, they lay in each other's arms under a double cover lined with azure cloth and filled with fine wool.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The torrent...?" she teased.</p>

  <p class="normal">"...and then, washes him out to sea."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have found love?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not since you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are available women in Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Seven thousand. My friend Balducci used to count them every Sunday."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You did not want them?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not my kind of love."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You never showed me my sonnets."</p>

  <p class="normal">"One was about the silkworm:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>"Were it mine, that shaggy fleece that stays,</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Woven and wrought into a vestment fair,</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Around her beauteous bosom in such bliss!</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>All through the day she'd clasp me! Would I were</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>The shoes that bear her burden! When the ways</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Were wet with rain, her feet I then should kiss!"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">She savored the lines.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How did you know I had a beauteous bosom? You had only seen me clothed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You forget my craft."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And the second sonnet?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He quoted a few lines from his first agony-wrought stanzas:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>"What joy hath yon glad wreath of flowers that is</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Around her golden hair so deftly twined,</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Each blossom pressing forward from behind,</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>As though to be the first her brows to kiss!"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"I have heard that you are a marvelous sculptor; travelers have spoken of your Pietà and David. You are a poet, as well."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My master, Messer Benivieni, would be pleased to hear you say so."</p>

  <p class="normal">They ceased talking, were together again. Clarissa murmured in his ear, holding his face down hard against her shoulder and neck, running her hand over the well-developed shoulders, the hard muscled arms like those that he had gone to sketch among the Maiano quarrymen, "To love for love... How wonderful. I had affection for Marco. Bentivoglio wanted only to be entertained. Tomorrow I will go to church to confess my sin, but I do not believe this love to be a sin."</p>

  <p class="normal">"God invented love. This is beautiful."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could the devil be tempting us?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The devil is an invention of man."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is no evil?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ugliness is evil."</p>

  <p class="chapter">5.</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached Julius' military encampment on the bank of the Reno River, through heavy snows. Julius was reviewing his troops, wrapped in an enormous furred and wadded overcoat up to his chin, on his head a gray woolen hood which covered his ears, forehead and mouth. Apparently Julius did not like the condition of the soldiers, for he was abusing his officers in coarse language, calling them "thieves and villains."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi had told him stories about the Pope: how he had won acclaim from his admirers as "well fitted for the military life" because he spent long hours with his troops in wretched weather, equaling them in enduring hardships, outswearing them, looking like an Old Testament prophet as he stormed up and down his lines, shouting orders, causing the troops to cry, "Holy Father, we look upon you as our commanding officer!" and his detractors to murmur behind their hands, "Holy Father, indeed! Nothing is left of the priest but the frock and the name."</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius led the way to his tent, hung with warm furs. Courtiers and cardinals gathered about the throne.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, I have been thinking what I would like you to sculpture for me. A tremendous bronze statue. A portrait in my ceremonial robes and triple crown..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bronze!" It was an agonized cry, wrung from his vitals. Had he thought it even remotely possible that the Pope would condemn him to bronze, he would never have returned to Bologna. He protested:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not my trade!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The peculiarly hushed silence he had heard in the palace dining hall the day before fell among the soldiers and prelates in the tent. The Pope's face flushed with anger.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are informed that you created a bronze David for the Maréchal de Gié of France. Is it your trade for him but not for your pontiff?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, I did that piece because I was urged to do it as a service to Florence."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Ecco! </span></i><span>You will do this statue as a service to your Pope."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, it is a bad sculpture! It is not completed. I know nothing of casting, finishing..."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Basta!" </span></i><span>The Pope's face was livid as he roared into a violent temper. "It is not enough that you defy me for seven months, refusing to return to my service! Even now you continue to pit your will against mine. You are incorrigible!"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"Not as a marble carver, Holy Father. Let me return to the blocks, and you will find me the most tractable worker in your service."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I command you, Buonarroti, to stop issuing ultimatums. You will create a bronze statue of me for San Petronio which Bologna will worship when I return to Rome. Go now, and study the space above the main portal. We will build a niche for you, as large as the space between the portal and the window will allow. You will create as stupendous a bronze as the niche will hold."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo knew he was going to have to do this miserable bronze in order to get back to his marbles. Yet perhaps it was no worse a penance than the seven months he had already thrown away in rebellion.</p>

  <p class="normal">By midafternoon he was back at the Pope's camp.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How large a statue can you fit there?" Julius demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">"For a seated figure, thirteen to fourteen feet."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How much will it cost?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think I can cast it for one thousand ducats, but it is not my profession, and I do not wish to take the responsibility."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You shall cast it over and over until it succeeds, and I will give you enough money to make you happy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, you can only make me happy by promising that if my bronze statue pleases you, you will permit me to resume carving the marble columns. If Your Holiness would make that promise, I would have twenty fingers with which to model the bronze."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The pontiff does not make bargains!" cried Julius. "Bring me your drawings in one week from this hour. Dismissed!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Humiliated, he made his way back to the Via di Mezzo di San Martino, climbed the stairs to Clarissa's apartment. Clarissa was dressed in a deep pink silk, with low neckline and bucket sleeves, a pink velvet girdle around her waist, her hair caught up in a garland of jeweled threads. She took one look at his pale, crushed face, kissed him on the sunken bridge of the nose. Feeling returned to his numbed mind and body.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Have you eaten today?" she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only crow."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is hot water on the fire. Would you like a bath to relax you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You can take it in the kitchen, while I find some food for you. I will wash your back."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've never had my back washed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Apparently there are a lot of things you have never had."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And may never again."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are depressed. What is the bad news from the Pope?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He told her that the Pope had demanded a bronze almost as large as Leonardo's enormous equestrian statue in Milan, which could not be cast.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How long will it take you to make the drawings?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To please Julius? An hour..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you have a full week free."</p>

  <p class="normal">She poured hot water into a long oval tub, handed him a scented cake of soap. He dropped his clothes on the kitchen floor, stepped gingerly into the hot water, then stretched his legs with a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why don't you spend it here, the week," said Clarissa, "just the two of us? No one will know where you are, you will be undisturbed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A whole week to think only of love! Is that possible? Not one thought of clay or bronze?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am not clay or bronze."</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached wet soapy arms up to her. She leaned down.</p>

  <p class="normal">"All these years I have said the female form was not beautiful to sculpture. I was wrong. You have the most beautiful body in the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You once told me that I was flawlessly carved."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In pink Crestola marble. I am a good sculptor, but I could never capture you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have captured me."</p>

  <p class="normal">She laughed, a soft musical tone that dissipated the last of the day's humiliation.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Here, dry yourself before the fire."</p>

  <p class="normal">He rubbed his skin hard and red, then Clarissa wrapped him in a second enormous towel, sat him at a table before a steaming dish of thin sliced veal and <i>piselli.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"I must send word to Gianfrancesco Aldovrandi. He invited me to stay with him."</p>

  <p class="normal">She stiffened for a moment, as though confronted with a past that was far gone from her mind.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Non importa, cara. </span></i><span>He knew I wanted you, ten years ago."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Her body relaxed, resumed its feline grace. She sat across the table from him, her face cupped in her hands, her eyes wide as she gazed at him. He ate ravenously. Content, he pushed his chair back from the table, turned toward the fire to let the flames lick his hands and face. Clarissa came to sit at his feet, her back against his shins. The feel of her flesh through her gown burned him more fiercely than the heat from the logs.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No other woman has made me want her," he exclaimed. "How can it be explained?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Love is not to be explained." She turned, got on her knees, wrapped her long slender arms about his neck. "It is to be enjoyed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And to be marveled at," he murmured. He burst into peals of laughter. "I'm sure the Pope didn't mean to do me a kindness, but he has... the first."</p>

  <p class="normal">On the last afternoon of the week, filled with a delicious lassitude, unable to feel any part of his body without a determined effort, oblivious to the cares of the world, he picked up drawing paper, a piece of charcoal, was amused to find he barely had the will to move it across the paper. He remembered the lines from Dante:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Neither upon down</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Nor under coverlets, men come to fame;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Without which, he who runs his course of life</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Leaves of himself on earth the selfsame trace</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>That smoke leaves in the air, or foam on water.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">With an effort he called to mind Julius sitting in the big throne room in the Appartamento Borgia in his long white robes. His fingers started to move. For several hours he drew Julius in a dozen tentative positions before catching a formal pose, with the Pope's left leg extended, the right leg bent inward, resting on a raised base for support, one arm reaching out, perhaps in benediction, the other holding some solid material object. The robes would cover the Pope's feet, so Michelangelo would be casting almost thirteen feet of solid bronze draperies. Two sets of fingers would be exposed, and whatever could be seen of Julius' features under the triple crown.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What about the Pope's face?" Clarissa asked. "The Holy Father is not going to be happy unless he recognizes himself."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The only thing I hate worse than making robes is making portraits. As my friend Jacopo Galli used to say, 'After sweet meat comes sour sauce.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">At the appointed hour he appeared before Julius, sketches in hand. The Pope was delighted.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You see, Buonarroti, I was right: you can make bronze statues."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Begging your pardon, Holy Father, this is not bronze, it is charcoal. But I will do my best so that I may return to the marbles in Rome. And now, if you will direct your treasurer to pay out some money to me, I shall buy supplies and begin work."</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius turned to Messer Carlino, his papal treasurer, and said, "You are to give Buonarroti whatever he needs."</p>

  <p class="normal">The treasurer, a sallow, thin-lipped man, gave him a hundred ducats from a chest. Michelangelo sent a messenger for Argiento, only a few miles away in Ferrara, and wrote to Manfidi, the new Herald of the Signoria, asking if the two bronze casters Lapo and Lotti, who were employed by the Duomo, could be sent to him in Bologna to help cast the Pope's statue. He offered a liberal wage.</p>

  <p class="normal">He rented a former carriage house on the Via de' Toschi, Street of the Tuscans, with a high ceiling, stone walls and an uneven orange-colored brick floor. There was a garden with a door at the back, and a walk-in fireplace for cooking. The walls had not felt a drop of paint in a hundred years, but unlike his rooms in Rome they were dry and unstained by watermarks. His next stop was at a used-furniture shop, where he found a Prato marriage bed, ten feet wide. On both sides and at the end was a low footboard which served as bench and chest. The bed came with a canopy, curtains and a striped mattress, old and lumpy, but clean. He also bought a kitchen table, some unpainted wood chairs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento arrived from Ferrara, explained that he had been unable to leave his brother's farm when Michelangelo called him to Rome in the spring, and set up his kitchen in the fireplace.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I like to learn about bronze," he told Michelangelo while scrubbing down the walls and then the floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lapo and Lotti arrived two days later, attracted by the offer of a higher wage than they were earning in Florence. Lapo, forty-one years old, considerably smaller than Michelangelo in stature, had such an honest face that Michelangelo put him in charge of all buying of supplies: wax, clay, cloth, brick for the casting ovens. Lotti, who had been trained as a goldsmith in the workshop of Antonio Pollaiuolo, was lean, purple-cheeked, a conscientious craftsman of forty-eight who served as master caster of the Florentine artillery.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Prato marriage bed proved to be a godsend; after Lapo had bought supplies and Argiento had shopped for food and a few cooking utensils for his kitchen, the hundred ducats were exhausted. The four men slept together in the bed, which at ten feet was wide enough for them to be comfortable. Only Argiento was unhappy, protesting to Michelangelo:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Everything costs too much! The shops are so crowded with courtiers and priests that a poor man like me isn't waited on."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Patience, Argiento, I'm going to ask Messer Carlino for more money, then I'll buy you a haircut and a new shirt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not worth it," replied Argiento, who looked like an unsheared sheep; "barbers are charging the double."</p>

  <p class="normal">Messer Carlino listened to Michelangelo's request with darkly brooding eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Like most commoners, Buonarroti, you have a mistaken conception of the role of a papal treasurer. My job is not to give money, it is to be resourceful in ways of refusing it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo said doggedly, "I did not ask to make this statue. You heard me say that the bare cost would be a thousand ducats. The Holy Father said to pay me the costs. I cannot set up a bronze caster's workshop without funds."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What did you do with the first hundred ducats?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"None of your business. The Pope said he would give me enough money to keep me happy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There isn't enough money in the world for that," said Carlino coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo lost his temper, called the treasurer an incisive Tuscan name. Carlino winced, bit his underlip.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Unless you hand over another hundred ducats," continued Michelangelo, "I shall go to the Pope and inform him that you are forcing me to abandon the statue."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bring me receipted bills for the first hundred, and written estimates of what you want to spend the second hundred for. I must keep the Pope's books accurately."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're like the gardener's dog, that neither eats cabbage himself nor lets anyone else."</p>

  <p class="normal">A ghostlike smile was transferred quickly from the ledgers of the treasurer's eyes to the till of his lips. "It is my job to make people hate me. Then they return as seldom as possible."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll be back."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lapo quieted him. "I remember what I spent. I'll write up the bills."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo walked through the Piazza Maggiore, then along the side of San Petronio to the open-sided gallery, flanked by the houses of bankers and the University of Bologna, crossed the Borgo Salamo and headed southeast to the Piazza of San Domenico. Inside the church, heavy with incense from a morning service, he went straight to the Dell'Arca marble sarcophagus, smiling to himself as he gazed at his own husky <i>contadino </i>boy with the wings of an eagle, ran his hands lovingly over the aged St. Petronius holding the model of Bologna in his arms, the face intelligent, saintly. He leaned down to sniff the clean white crystals of young St. Proculus, with his belted shirt, magnificently corded legs. Suddenly he straightened. The St. Proculus had been broken in two places, awkwardly repaired.</p>

  <p class="normal">He felt someone staring at him, whirled, saw a man with an egg-shaped head, narrower at the top than at the base, a ragged shirt covering his chest, his bulging arms and shoulders orange-colored with the dust of the Bolognese earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vincenzo!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Welcome back to Bologna."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You wretch, you made good your promise to break one of the marbles."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The day it fell I was in the country, making brick. I can prove it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You saw to that."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It could happen again. There are wicked folk who say your statue of the Pope will be melted down the day his soldiers leave Emilia."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo blanched. "If I report that to the Holy Father, he will have you drawn and quartered in the public square."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Me? I am a most devout man! I plan to kneel and cross myself before it. It's other sculptors who make threats."</p>

  <p class="chapter">6.</p>

  <p class="normal">He started work at white heat, driven by a fury to get finished almost before he began. Lapo and Lotti knew what could be cast, advised him on the technical structure of his armature under the wax model, the composition of the enlarged clay. They worked together in the cold carriage room, which Argiento's fire heated only for a radius of a few feet. Come warm weather, he would return to the enclosed courtyard at the rear of San Petronio where he had carved his earlier marble figures. He would need this kind of outdoor space when Lapo and Lotti began building the giant baking oven for the fourteen-foot bronze.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi sent him models, spread the word that those men most closely resembling Pope Julius would be paid a special wage. Michelangelo sketched from light to dark, Argiento cooked and cleaned, Lotti built a small brick oven to test the local metals for fusing, Lapo did the buying, paid off the models.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tuscans say that the appetite comes while eating; Michelangelo found that craftsmanship comes with working. Though he did not consider clay modeling authentic sculpturing, since it was the art of adding on, he was also learning that there was nothing in his nature which would permit him to do a sleazy job. Much as he detested bronze, he was going to have to make the best bronze statue of the Pope that he could conceivably dig out of himself, even if it took twice as long. The Pope had not done right by him, either in Rome or here in Bologna, but that did not free him from doing right by himself. He would finish this giant bronze so that it brought honor on himself and the Buonarroti name; if it earned him neither the happiness the Pope had promised nor the creative ecstasy that came from carving marble, that was of secondary importance. He was a victim of his own integrity, which forced him to do his best, even when he would have preferred to do nothing at all.</p>

  <p class="normal">His only joy was Clarissa. Though he often worked after dark, drawing and modeling by candlelight, he managed to steal off a couple of nights a week to spend with her. No matter what hour he arrived there was food by the side of the fire, ready to be heated, pots of hot water for the oval-shaped tub.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're not eating very much," she commented when she saw his ribs beginning to arc through the skin. "Is it because Argiento is a bad cook?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"More because I have been turned away three times by the papal treasurer when I went for money. He says my costs are falsified, yet Lapo puts down every cent he spends..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Couldn't you come here each night for your supper? Then at least you would have one good meal a day."</p>

  <p class="normal">She laughed as her words echoed in her ears.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have been talking like a wife. In Bologna we have a saying, 'Wives and wind are necessary evils.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">He put his arms about her, kissed her warm, stirring lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But artists do not marry?" she added.</p>

  <p class="normal">"An artist lives everywhere. This is the closest I will come."</p>

  <p class="normal">She returned his kiss. "We will have no more serious talk. In my house I want you to have only happiness."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are better at keeping your promises than the Pope."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I love you. That makes it easier."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I hope that when he sees himself in fourteen feet of bronze he will be so pleased he too will love me. Only in that way can I get back to my columns."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are they so exquisite?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"How fair thou art, my true love, how fair! Eyes soft as doves' eyes, half-seen behind thy veil; the neck rising proudly, nobly adorned; graceful thy breasts as two fauns that feed among the lilies... Fair in every part, no fault in all thy fashioning.' So, too, my marble columns...."</p>

  <p class="normal">Mail from home came irregularly over the Futa Pass. Michelangelo looked forward to news of the family, but mostly he received requests for money. Lodovico had found a farm at Pozzolatico; it was good income property, but a deposit had to be paid right away. If Michelangelo could send five hundred florins, or even three hundred... From Buonarroto and Giovansimone, both working at the Strozzi wool shop near the Porta Rossa, there was rarely a letter without the lines, "You promised us a shop. We are tired of working for someone else. We want to make lots of money...."</p>

  <p class="normal">Muttering to himself, "Me too," Michelangelo wrapped himself in a blanket in the freezing carriage house while his three assistants slept in the Prato bed, and answered the family:</p>

  <p class="normal">"As soon as I come to Florence, I will set you up in business by yourselves, or with a company, as you wish. I shall try to get money for your deposit on the farm. I think I shall be ready to cast my statue around the middle of Lent; so pray God that it turns out well; for if it does, I think I will be in luck with the Pope...."</p>

  <p class="normal">He spent hours following Julius about, sketching him in a variety of poses: saying mass, walking in procession, holding court, shouting in anger, laughing uproariously at a courtier's joke, fidgeting in his chair while he received deputations from all over Europe; until at length he knew through his drawing hand every muscle, bone and sinew of the Pope's body beneath his robes. Then he returned to the carriage house to model in wax or clay each characteristic turn and twist.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, when do I see some work?" the pontiff demanded on Christmas Day, after saying mass in the cathedral. "I do not know how much longer I will keep the court here, I needs must return to Rome. Inform me when you are ready, and I will come to your workshop."</p>

  <p class="normal">Spurred by this promise, Michelangelo, Lapo, Lotti and Argiento worked day and night, building the thirteen-foot-high armature of wood, then slowly adding on the clay, touch by touch, spatula by spatula, to create the model from which the bronze would be cast. He created the naked figure of the Pope, seated on his big throne, one arm raised, the left leg extended as he had envisaged him in his drawings. He derived keen pleasure from seeing the true figure of Julius emerge before him, vast in size, true in composition, line, mass, movement. He worked huge rolls of linen cloth over a duplicate model that Lotti and Argiento built for him, practicing with mud from the yard as he had with Tiber mud in Rome, to see how best to model the Pope's regal robes without concealing the fiery figure beneath.</p>

  <p class="normal">Caught up in the heat of his own creation, he worked absorbedly for twenty hours a day, then threw himself on the bed between Argiento and Lotti. In the third week of January he waited on the Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If Your Holiness would come to my workshop, the model is ready to be approved."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Excellent! I shall come this afternoon."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you. And could you bring your treasurer? He seems to think I am building the statue out of Bolognese sausages."</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius arrived at midafternoon, accompanied by Messer Carlino. Michelangelo had draped a quilt over his one comfortable chair. Here the Pope sat in silence, studying his portrait.</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius was pleased. He rose, walked around the model several times, commenting on its accuracy and lifelike qualities. Then he stopped in front of the statue, looking perplexedly at his right hand, which was raised in a haughty, almost violent gesture.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, does this hand intend to bless or curse?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had to improvise, for this was the Pope's favorite gesture while sitting on his throne ruling the Christian world.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The right hand lifted, Holy Father, bids the Bolognese be obedient even though you are in Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And the left hand. What shall it hold?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"A book?" asked Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A book?" cried the Pope scornfully. "A sword! I am no scholar. A sword!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo winced.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could the Holy Father perhaps be holding in his left hand the keys to the new St. Peter's?"</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Bravissimo! </span></i><span>We must extract large sums from every church for the building, and the symbol of keys will help us." Glancing at Carlino, Michelangelo added, "I must buy seven to eight hundred pounds of wax to create the model for the oven...."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope authorized the expenditure and swept out to join his train waiting in the street. Michelangelo sent Lapo to shop for the wax. Lapo returned shortly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I cannot get it for less than nine florins and forty soldi a hundred. Better buy it at once, it is a good bargain."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Go back and tell them that if they will knock off the forty soldi I'll take it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, the Bolognese people would be the last in the world to take a lira off what they ask."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was disturbed by a strange note in Lapo's voice. "It can wait until tomorrow."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Lapo was occupied Michelangelo said quietly to Argiento, "Go to the same shop and ask the price."</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento returned, whispered, "They are asking only eight and a half florins, and I can get off the brokerage charge."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's what I thought. Lapo's honest face has made a fool of me! Carlino was right. Here, take the money, get a receipt, and wait for their wagon to deliver."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was dark by the time the donkey pulled up in front of the carriage house and the men brought in the wrapped bales of wax. When they had gone Michelangelo showed Lapo the bill.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Lapo, you've been taking a profit from me. On everything you bought."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why shouldn't I?" the man demanded without change in expression. "When you pay so little."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Little? I've given you twenty-seven florins in the last six weeks, far more than you earn at the Duomo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But we live so miserably! There isn't enough to eat!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You eat what we eat," growled Argiento, his heavy-knuckled fists clenched. "Food's expensive in the markets, the court and the visitors buy it up. If you had stolen less there would have been more for all of us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's food in the restaurants. And wine in the wineshops. And women in the Street of the Bordellos. I would not live the way you live."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then return to Florence," said Michelangelo bitterly, "where you live better."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're firing me? You can't do that. I've told everybody that I am the artist on the job, and am in favor with the Pope."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you go right back and tell them that you're a liar and a petty thief."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll complain against you to the Signoria. I'll tell Florence what a miser you are...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Kindly leave behind the seven florins I advanced you against future work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Never! It will be my travel money home."</p>

  <p class="normal">He began packing his possessions. Lotti came to Michelangelo, said apologetically, "I'm afraid I must go with him."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But why, Lotti? You have done nothing wrong. We have been friends."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I admire you, Messer Buonarroti, and I hope I can work for you again sometime. But I came with Lapo, and I must go with him."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night, alone in their empty, echoing carriage house, Michelangelo and Argiento were unable to eat the <i>stufato </i>that Argiento had thrown together. Michelangelo waited until Argiento was asleep in the enormous bed, then went to Aldovrandi's, wrote a full account to the Herald of the Signoria, and one as well to his father. He then walked the deserted streets to Clarissa's, found her asleep. Cold, nervous, shaking inwardly with frustration and rage, he got under the quilts, warmed his body by clasping her to him. But that was all. He was worried and upset, lay wide-eyed. Unhappiness is not the climate for love-making.</p>

  <p class="chapter">7.</p>

  <p class="normal">He lost not only Lapo and Lotti but Clarissa as well.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope announced that he would return to Rome for Lent. This gave Michelangelo only a few weeks in which to perfect the wax model and get the Pope's approval. Without experienced helpers, without a bronze caster to be found in Emilia, it meant that he had to work through the days and weeks with no thought of food, sleep, relaxation. On those rare hours when he could tear himself away he had no time to sit companionably with her, to talk to her, tell her what he was doing. He went only when he could no longer contain his own passion, when hunger for her drove him blindly through the streets, to seize her, possess her, and then to leave at once. This vestigial shred was all that the demands of his job left for love. Clarissa was sad, she gave less of herself each time he came, until she was giving nothing at all, in an act that bore no resemblance to the full sweetness of their early love.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leaving the apartment one night, he studied his fingers, discolored from the wax.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Clarissa, I'm sorry for the way things are."</p>

  <p class="normal">She raised, then lowered her hands hopelessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Artists live everywhere... and nowhere. You are inside that bronze statue. Bentivoglio has sent a groom from Milan. With a carriage to take me there...."</p>

  <p class="normal">A few days later the Pope visited the workyard for the last time, approved the model, the hand holding the keys of St. Peters, the face at once fierce and benign. Julius liked this image of himself, gave Michelangelo his benediction, as well as an order on Antonmaria da Lignano, a Bolognese banker, to continue paying his costs.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Farewell, Buonarroti, I shall see you in Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hope flared in Michelangelo. "Then we will continue on the tomb... I mean the marbles?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only God can predict the future," replied the pontiff loftily.</p>

  <p class="normal">Desperately needing a bronze caster, he wrote again to the Herald in Florence, asking him to send Master Bernardino, the best in Tuscany. The Herald wrote that Master Bernardino was not available. Michelangelo scoured the countryside until he found a French cannon maker who agreed to come, build the big oven and cast his statue. He returned to Bologna to wait. The Frenchman never arrived. He wrote again to the Herald in Florence. This time Master Bernardino agreed to come, but it would be weeks before he could finish his tasks in Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">Unseasonal heat struck early in March, killing the spring crops. Bologna the Fat became Bologna the Lean. The plague followed, invading forty families within a few days. Those who dropped in the streets were left exposed, no one daring to touch the bodies. Michelangelo and Argiento moved their workshop out of the carriage house and into the yard at the side of San Petronio, where there was an occasional breath of air.</p>

  <p class="normal">Master Bernardino arrived in a blaze of May heat. He approved the wax model, built a tremendous brick oven in the center of the courtyard. There followed weeks of experimenting with the fires, testing the way the metals fused, making an enclosing envelope of ash, earth, horse manure and hair, applying them layer by layer, and enclosing the wax to the width of half a span. Michelangelo was filled with impatience to cast, and go home.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We must not hurry," Bernardino warned him. "One untested step, and all our work will be for nothing."</p>

  <p class="normal">He must not hurry; but it was already more than two years since he had entered the employ of Pope Julius. He had lost his house, his years, and he had not been able to save a single scudo. As far as he could gather he was the only one who did not profit from his contact with a Pope. He read again the letter that had arrived from his father that morning, crying for money for another wonderful opportunity to invest. The details Lodovico dared not write, they had to be kept secret for fear someone might steal them; but he had to have two hundred florins immediately or he would lose the great bargain, and he would never forgive Michelangelo for his stinginess.</p>

  <p class="normal">Feeling put upon by both his Holy Father and his earthly father, Michelangelo went to the bank of Antonmaria da Lignano. He set down the figures and details of his two barren years in Julius' service, his urgent need. The banker was sympathetic.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope has only authorized me to pay out money as you need supplies. But tranquillity is an important supply too, for an artist. Suppose we compromise: I'll advance you one hundred florins against future needs, and you can send the money home today."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi came frequently to watch the preparations. "This bronze of yours is going to make me a rich man," he commented, wiping his brow as the testing of the oven turned the workyard into an inferno.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How so?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bologna is betting that your statue is too large to cast. Giving good odds. I'm taking all bets."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It will cast," replied Michelangelo grimly. "I have watched Master Bernardino step by step. He could make bronze without fire."</p>

  <p class="normal">But when they finally poured in June, something went wrong. The statue came out well as far as the waist; the rest of the material, nearly half of the metal, remained in the furnace. It did not fuse. In order to take it out it was necessary to dismantle the furnace. Aghast, Michelangelo cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"What could have gone wrong?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know. This has never happened to me before." Bernardino was as wretched as Michelangelo. "There must have been something wrong with the second half of the copper and brass. I'm so ashamed."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoarsely, Michelangelo replied, "You are a good artisan, and you put your heart into the work. But he who works, at times fails."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I feel ill. I'll start again tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bologna, like Florence and Rome, had its system of instantaneous communication. In a flash it was all over town that Michelangelo had failed to cast the pontiffs statue. Crowds started to pour into the courtyard to see for themselves. Among them was Vincenzo, who slapped the still warm bricks of the furnace triumphantly and cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only a Bolognese knows how to use Bologna brick. Or make Bolognese statues. Back to Florence, puny one."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo whirled around to pick up an iron bar. Aldovrandi arrived in time to intervene, curtly ordered Vincenzo from the yard, then cleared the others out.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How serious is the failure, Michelangelo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only half. As soon as we can rebuild the furnace we'll be able to pour into the mold from the top again. If the metal fuses we'll be all right."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'll make it next time."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Bernardino entered the courtyard in the morning his face was green.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What a cruel city this is! They think they have gained a victory because of our failure."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They don't like Florentines, and I guess they don't like the Pope either. If we fail we kill two birds with one bronze."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't raise my eyes in the streets."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let us live here in the courtyard until we can pour again."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bernardino worked heroically, night and day, rebuilt the furnace, tested the channels to the mold, experimented with the metals that had not fused. Finally, under the blinding heat of the mid-July sun, he poured again. Slowly, as they nervously waited, the heated metal began to run from the furnace to the mold. With that, Bernardino said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's nothing more you need me for. I leave for Florence at dawn."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But don't you want to see how the statue comes out? Whether the two halves join well? Then you can laugh in the faces of the Bolognese."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bernardino wearily pushed the thought aside. "I don't want revenge. Only escape. If you'll pay me what you owe me I'll be gone."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was left to discover the results himself. He had to sit on his hands for three weeks, while the country burned up in a drought and Argiento could find fewer fruits and vegetables in the market, until the mold cooled sufficiently for him to tear it down.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bernardino had done his job. The two halves of the statue were joined without a serious mark. The bronze was red and rough, but there were no imperfections. "A few weeks of filing and polishing," Michelangelo thought, "and I, too, will be on my way."</p>

  <p class="normal">He had misgauged the task. August, September, October went by, water became almost unavailable at any price, while he and Argiento went through the hateful manual labor, neither of them understanding the nature of bronze, their nostrils filled with the filings and scrapings, seemingly condemned to an eternity of cleaning up the tremendous statue.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally in November the bronze was finished, rubbed down to a shiny dark tone. It was a full year since he had come to Bologna. Michelangelo went to Antonmaria to ask him for a final inspection and dismissal. The banker was delighted with the result.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have surpassed the Holy Father's greatest hopes."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I leave it in your care."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You can't do that."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have received an order from the Pope saying that you must install it properly on the façade of San Petronio."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But my agreement says that I may leave it where I finish it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope's latest order is the one to be obeyed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Does the Holy Father say that I am to be paid?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. Only that you are to install."</p>

  <p class="normal">No one quite knew why there were delays: the ledge was not yet finished; it had to be painted; the Christmas holidays were approaching; then the Epiphany.... Argiento decided to return to his brother's farm. As he bade Michelangelo good-by there was a puzzled expression on his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"An artist is like a <i>contadino; </i>his chief harvest is trouble."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was not killing time, time was killing him. He rolled the full width of the Prato bed burning with marble fever, aching to have hammer and chisel in his hands, to be tearing through the white crystalline stone with the sweet acrid dust caking in his nostrils; his loins swollen and throbbing for Clarissa, longing to possess her; the two acts mystically cojoining in a continuous "Go."</p>

  <p class="normal">At last a crew came, after the middle of February, to move the statue under its protective cloth to the front of San Petronio. Bells rang all over the city. The statue was hoisted into the niche, over the Della Quercia portal. The whole city assembled in the Piazza Maggiore, listening to the fifes, trumpets and drums. At the hour which the astrologers had told Julius was propitious, three in the afternoon, the covering was removed from the statue. The crowd cheered, then fell to its knees and crossed itself. That evening there were fireworks in the square.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo, standing in his worn workman's shirt at the far end of the piazza, went unnoticed. Looking up at Julius in his niche, illuminated by shooting rockets, he felt nothing. Not even relief. He was dry, barren, used up, too exhausted from the long, senseless wait and waste to wonder if at long last he had bought his freedom.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked the streets of Bologna all night, hardly knowing where he was. There was a cold drizzle. He had exactly four and a half florins left. At dawn he knocked at Aldovrandi's door to bid his friend good-by. Aldovrandi loaned him a horse, as he had eleven years before.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only a little way into the foothills the rain began to fall in torrents. It rained all the way into Florence, the horse's hoofs slopping through the wet earth. The road seemed endless. His hands loosened on the reins, his head began to spin, exhaustion overtook him... until he lost consciousness, fell off the horse and struck his head on the roadbed.</p>

  <p class="chapter">8.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My dear Michelangelo," said Gonfaloniere Soderini, "it seems to me that you are more often covered with mud than with capon broth."</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat back, let the brittle early March sunlight stream over his face. Michelangelo had learned in the several days since his return to Florence that Soderini had good reason to be satisfied with himself: through his brilliant roving ambassador, Niccolò Machiavelli, whom he had been training in the same manner that Lorenzo de' Medici had trained him, Florence had concluded a series of amiable treaties which should enable the city-state to live in peace and prosperity.</p>

  <p class="normal">"All reports from Bologna and the Vatican tell us that Julius is delighted...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Gonfaloniere, the five years I spent carving the David, the Bruges Madonna and the tondos were the happiest of my life. I hunger for only one thing: to carve marble."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini leaned across the desk, his eyes sparkling.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Signoria knows how to express its gratitude. I am empowered to offer you a fine commission: a gigantic Hercules, to match your David. With one of your figures on either side of the main gate to the Palazzo della Signoria, ours will be the noblest entrance to a city-state government in the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo drew in his breath. A giant Hercules! Representing all that was the strongest and finest of the classical culture of Greece. <i>Il Magnifico </i>had made Florence the Athens of the West; here was an opportunity to establish the connecting link between Pericles and Lorenzo, to follow through his early experiments with a Hercules. He shook with excitement</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can I have my house back? And my studio to carve the Hercules in?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's rented now, but the lease expires soon. I will charge you eight florins a month rental. When you begin carving the Apostles, the house will become yours again."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sat down, suddenly weak.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is where I will live and carve all the rest of my life. May God hear my words."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini asked anxiously. "What about Rome, and the tomb marbles?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've written to Sangallo. He has made it clear to the Pope that I will go back to Rome only to revise my agreement and bring the marble columns back to Florence. I will work them all together: Moses, Hercules, St. Matthew, the Captives..."</p>

  <p class="normal">His voice was full of the joy he felt inside himself. Soderini gazed over his wife's red geraniums to the roofs of Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not part of my job to interfere in family life, but the time has come for you to secure your freedom from your father. I want him to go with you to a notary and sign a legal emancipation. Up to now the money you have earned has been legally his. After your emancipation it will belong to you, and you can control it. What you give to your father then will be a gift, not an obligation."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was silent. He knew all of his father's failings yet he loved him, shared Lodovico's pride in the family name, the desire to rebuild its place in Tuscan society. He shook his head, slowly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It would do no good, Gonfaloniere. I would have to turn over the money to him anyway, even if it were mine."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini persisted. "I shall make an appointment with the notary. Now, about the marble for the Hercules..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could I select at Carrara?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will write to Cuccarello, the quarry owner, telling him that you are to have the biggest and purest block ever quarried in the Apuan Alps."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico was heartbroken at being obliged to appear before the notary, Ser Giovanni da Romena, for under Tuscan law an unmarried son became free only at the death of his father. There were tears in Lodovico's eyes as they walked home, past the ancient church of San Firenze, and up the Via del Proconsolo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, you won't abandon us now? You promised Buonarroto and Giovansimone that you would set them up in a shop. We need to buy several more farms, to build our income..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Because of a few lines on paper Michelangelo's relationship with his father had been reversed. Now he was the one in authority; he could no longer be badgered or driven. Yet, glancing out of the corner of his eyes, he saw that sixty-four-year-old Lodovico had aged ten years in the ten-minute legal ceremony; his head was bowed, his shoulders hunched.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will always do everything in my power for the family, Father. What else have I? My work and my family."</p>

  <p class="normal">He renewed his friendships at the Company of the Cauldron. Rosselli had died, Botticelli was too ill to attend, and so younger members had been elected, including Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, Sebastiano da Sangallo, Franciabigio, Jacopo Sansovino, Andrea del Sarto, a talented painter. He was delighted with Granacci, who had completed two works that had absorbed him for several years: a Madonna with Infant St. John, and St. John the Evangelist at Patmos.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Granacci, you acknowledged scoundrel! These are glorious. The color is beautiful, the figures fine. I always told you that you would become a great painter, if you worked at it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci flushed. "What do you say we have a party at the villa tonight? I'll invite the Company."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How is Vermiglia?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vermiglia? Married. To a clerk in Pistoia. She wanted to start a family. I gave her a dowry. I have a new girl: hair redder than Tedesco's, plump as a partridge..."</p>

  <p class="normal">He learned that Contessina's lot was considerably better now; with the growing popularity and importance of Cardinal Giovanni in Rome, the Signoria had permitted the Ridolfi family to move up the hill to the main villa, far more commodious and comfortable. Cardinal Giovanni sent the supplies and money they needed. Contessina was permitted to come into Florence whenever she wished, but not Ridolfi. She would have been permitted to join her brother in Rome, but since Ridolfi was still an avowed enemy of the Republic the Signoria was not willing to let him out of its earshot.</p>

  <p class="normal">She caught him flat-footedly gazing at his David.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is still good? You have not worn out your pleasure in it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He whirled at the sound of her voice, found himself gazing into the piercing brown eyes that had always been able to stab through his thoughts. She had high color in her cheeks from the walk in the brisk March air; her figure had filled out; she was growing a little matronly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Contessina! How well you look. It is good to see you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How was Bologna?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Dante's Inferno."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All of it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Though her question was innocently asked, he flushed to the curls brushed down over his square brow.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What was her name?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Clarissa."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why did you leave her?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"She left me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why didn't you follow?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had no carriage."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you have known love, some portion of it?" she asked seriously.</p>

  <p class="normal">"In full measure."</p>

  <p class="normal">Tears flooded her eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Permit me to envy you," she whispered, and was gone, walking quickly out of the piazza before he could follow her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gonfaloniere Soderini advanced him two hundred florins against future work. He went to see young Lorenzo Strozzi, whom he had known since his family bought the Hercules. Lorenzo Strozzi had married Lucrezia Rucellai, daughter of <i>Il Magnifico's </i>sister Nannina, and of Michelangelo's cousin, Bernardo Rucellai. Michelangelo asked Strozzi if he could invest a modest sum in his brothers' names, so that they might begin to share in the profits of the shop.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If the arrangement works well, Messer Strozzi, I could keep building the fund as I accumulate money, so that my brothers will earn more."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That will be agreeable to my family, Buonarroti. And if at any time you wish your brothers to open an independent shop, we will provide them with the wool from our looms in Prato."</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked to the Duomo workyard, was raucously welcomed by Beppe and his stonehewers. Only Lapo turned away.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You want me to build another shop for you?" Beppe cackled toothlessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not yet, Beppe, not until I go to Carrara and find a block for the Hercules. But if you would help me move the St. Matthew so I won't be in your way..."</p>

  <p class="normal">He had chosen St. Matthew because his was the first gospel in the New Testament, and because Matthew had not met a violent end. His early sketches of Matthew had envisaged him as a tranquil scholar, book in one hand, chin held reflectively in the other. Though he had broken into the front wall of the block, uncertainty had kept him from probing further. Now he understood why; he could find no historical Matthew. His was not the first gospel written, for he had absorbed much of Mark; he was said to have been close to Jesus, yet he had not written his gospel until fifty to seventy years after Christ's death....</p>

  <p class="normal">He took his problem to Prior Bichiellini. The prior's deep blue eyes had grown larger behind his magnifying lenses as his face shrank with age.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Everything about St. Matthew is disputed," he murmured in the quiet library. "Was he Levi, a tax collector in the service of Herod Antipas? Perhaps, perhaps not. The sole reference to him outside the New Testament is in Greek, and in error; it says that Matthew composed the Oracles in the Hebrew language. But they were written in Greek, for Greek-speaking Jews, to prove to them that Jesus was several times predicted in the Old Testament."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What am I to do, Father?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You must create your own Matthew, even as you created your own David and Pietà. Walk away from the books; the wisdom lies in you. Whatever you carve about Matthew will be the truth."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo smiled as he shook his head up and down. "Father, your words are kind; no one has ever had so much faith in me."</p>

  <p class="normal">He started over again, searching for a Matthew who would symbolize man in his tortuous quest for God. Could he carve Matthew in an upward spiraling movement, trying to break his way out of the marble block, even as man had struggled to release himself from the stone mountain of polytheism in which he had lain enchained? He designed Matthew's left knee to push forcibly against the stone, as though striving to release the torso from its imprisoning cowl, arms held close, head twisted agonizingly away from the body, searching for a way of escape.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last he was back in the column, feeling whole again, and a master, the fierceness of his joy sending the chisel through the block like lightning through cumulus clouds. He carved in a heat as great as that of the forge in which his tools were tempered; the marble and the flesh of Matthew became one, with Matthew projecting out of the block by the sheer force of his will, to achieve a soul with which to rise to God. Did not every man strive to emerge from the womb to achieve immortality?</p>

  <p class="normal">Thirsting for a more lyrical mood, he returned to Taddei's Our Lady, carving the round frame, the serene, lovely face of Mary, the textured skin of the infant Jesus stretched across his mother's lap. Then came word from Pope Julius that Florence was to celebrate a Jubilee of Guilt and Punishment in order to raise funds with which to build the new St. Peter's.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have been put in charge of the decorations," announced Granacci gleefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Granacci, you're not going back to theater scenery again, after those fine paintings? It's a waste of your talent. I protest."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My talent has plenty of time," said Granacci. "A man should have some fun."</p>

  <p class="normal">A Jubilee to pay for Bramante's church would be no fun for Michelangelo. It was scheduled for April. He vowed to flee the city and spend the days with the Topolinos. Again the Pope interfered with his plans.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have just received a <i>breve </i>from Pope Julius," said Soderini. "You see, it was sealed with the Fisherman's ring. He asks you to come to Rome. He has good news for you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That can only mean he is going to let me carve again."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will go?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tomorrow. Sangallo wrote that my second shipload of marbles has been lying exposed in the Piazza San Pietro. I want to rescue them."</p>

  <p class="chapter">9.</p>

  <p class="normal">His eyes bulged when he saw the marbles dumped like a cord of firewood, discolored by rain and dust. Giuliano da Sangallo gripped his arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Holy Father is waiting for you."</p>

  <p class="normal">They passed through the smaller of the throne rooms of the Papal palace, filled with a variety of supplicants hoping for an audience. Once in the large throne room, he advanced toward the throne, bowing to Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, nodding formally to Cardinal Riario. Pope Julius caught sight of him, suspended a conversation with his nephew Francesco, Prefect of Rome, and Paris de Grassis. Julius was dressed in a white linen cassock, his pleated knee-length tunic had tight sleeves, while the elbow-length scarlet velvet cape was trimmed in ermine, as was the scarlet velvet skullcap.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, Buonarroti, you have returned to us. You are pleased with the statue in Bologna, are you not?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It will bring honor on us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You see," cried Julius triumphantly, throwing out his arms energetically to include the entire room. "You had no confidence in yourself. When I made this splendid opportunity available to you, you cried out, 'It is not my trade!'" The Pope's mimicking of Michelangelo's slightly hoarse voice brought appreciative laughter from the court. "Now you see how you have made it your trade, by creating a fine bronze."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are generous, Holy Father," murmured Michelangelo with a twinge of impatience, his mind occupied with the pile of stained marbles lying just a few hundred yards away.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I intend to continue being generous," cried the Pope heartily. "I am going to favor you above all the painting masters of Italy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...'painting' masters?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. I have decided that you are the best artist to complete the work begun by your countrymen Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Rosselli, whom I myself hired to paint the frieze in the Sistine Chapel. I am commissioning you to complete my uncle Sixtus' chapel by painting the ceiling."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a light patter of applause. Michelangelo was stunned. Nausea gripped him. He had asked Sangallo to make it clear to the Pope that he would return to Rome only to begin carving on the sculptures for the tomb. He cried passionately:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am a sculptor, not a painter!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius shook his head in despair.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had less trouble conquering Perugia and Bologna than I have in subduing you!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am not a Papal State, Holy Father. Why should you waste your precious time subduing me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The room went silent. The Pope glared at him, thrust out his bearded chin, demanded icily, "Where did you have your religious training, that you dare to question your pontiff's judgment?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"As your prelate said in Bologna, Holiness, I am but an ignorant artist, without good manners."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you can carve your masterpiece in a cell of Sant'Angelo."</p>

  <p class="normal">All Julius had to do was wave a hand at a guard, and he could rot in a dungeon for years. He gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That would bring you little honor. Marble is my profession. Let me carve the Moses, Victors, Captives. Many would come to see the statues, offering thanks to Your Holiness for making them possible."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In short," snapped Julius, "I need your sculptures to assure my place in history."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They could help, Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an audible gasp from those around the throne. The Pope turned to his cardinals and courtiers.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you hear that, gentlemen? I, Julius II, who recovered the long-lost Papal States for the Church and brought stability to Italy, who have cleaned out the scandals of the Borgias, published a constitution abolishing simony and elevated the decorum of the Sacred College, achieved a modern architecture for Rome... I need Michelangelo Buonarroti to establish my historical position."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo had gone deathly pale. Cardinal Giovanni stared out a window as though he were not there. The Pope loosened the collar of his cape against his own warmth, took a deep breath and started again.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, my informants in Florence describe your panel for the Signoria as 'the school of the world'..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness," interrupted Michelangelo, cursing himself for his envy of Leonardo that had led him into this trap, "it was an accident, something that could never be repeated. The Great Hall needed an accompanying fresco for the other half of the wall.... It was a diversion."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Bene. </span></i><span>Make such a diversion for the Sistine. Are we to understand that you will paint a wall for a Florentine hall, but not a ceiling for a papal chapel?"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The silence in the room was crushing. An armed courtier, standing by the Pope's side, said, "Your Holiness, give me the word and we will hang this presumptuous Florentine from the Torre di Nona."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope glowered at Michelangelo, who stood before him defiant but speechless. Their eyes met, held in an exchange of immovability. Then a wisp of a smile drifted across the pontiff's face, was reflected in the tiny amber sparkle of Michelangelo's eyes, the barest twitching of his lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This presumptuous Florentine, as you call him," said the Pope, "was described ten years ago by Jacopo Galli as the best sculpture master in Italy. So he is. If I had wanted him fed to the ravens I would have done so long ago."</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned back to Michelangelo, said in the tone of an exasperated but fond father:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, you will paint the Twelve Apostles on the ceiling of the Sistine, and decorate the vault with customary designs. For this we will pay you three thousand large gold ducats. We shall also be pleased to pay the expenses and wages of any five assistants you may choose. When the Sistine vault is completed, you have your pontiff's promise that you shall return to the carving of the marbles. My son, you are dismissed."</p>

  <p class="normal">What further word could he say? He had been proclaimed supreme among his country's artists, made a promise that he would resume work on the tomb. Where could he flee? To Florence? To have Gonfaloniere Soderini cry out, "We cannot go to war with the Vatican because of you." To Spain, Portugal, Germany, England...? The Pope's power reached everywhere. The Pope demanded much, but a lesser pontiff might well have excommunicated him. And if he had refused to come back to Rome? He had tried that too, for a barren seven months in Florence. There was nothing to do but submit.</p>

  <p class="normal">He kneeled, kissed the Pope's ring.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It shall be as the Holy Father desires."</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, he stood by the front entrance of the Sistine Chapel, his mind aswirl with revulsion and self-incrimination. Sangallo was just behind him, his face haggard, looking as though he had been whipped.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I did this to you. I persuaded the Pope to build himself a triumphal tomb, and to call you here to sculpture it. All you have had is grief...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You tried to help me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I could not have controlled the Pope. No. But I could have been more realistic about Bramante. Come to grips with his... charm... his talent... Because of him I am no longer an architect and you are no longer a sculptor."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo wept. Michelangelo shepherded him inside the protective doorway of the chapel, put an arm about the trembling shoulders.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Pazienza, caro, </span></i><span>patience. We will work our way out of this predicament."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"You are young, Michelangelo, you have time. I am old. Nor have you heard the crowning indignity. I volunteered to erect the scaffolding for you, since I renovated the chapel and know it well. But even this I was denied. Julius had already arranged with Bramante to build it... All I want now is to return to my home in Florence, enjoy a little peace before I die."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do not speak of dying. Let us speak instead of how we can tackle this architectural monstrosity." He threw both arms up in a despairing gesture that embraced the Sistine. "Explain this... edifice... to me. Why was it built this way?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo explained that when it was first completed the building had looked more like a fortress than a chapel. Since Pope Sixtus had intended to use it for the defense of the Vatican in the event of war, the top had been crowned by an open battlement from which soldiers could fire cannons and drop stones on attackers. When the neighboring Sant'Angelo had been strengthened as a fortress that could be reached by a high-walled passageway from the Papal palace, Julius had ordered Sangallo to extend the Sistine roof to cover the crenelated parapet. Quarters for the soldiers, above the vault that Michelangelo had been ordered to paint, were now unused.</p>

  <p class="normal">Strong sunlight was streaming in from three tall windows, lighting the glorious frescoes of Botticelli and Rosselli opposite, shooting strong beams of light across the variegated marble floor. The side walls, one hundred and thirty-three feet long, were divided into three zones on their way up to the barrel vault, sixty-eight feet above: the lowest area was covered by tapestries, the frieze of frescoes filled the second and middle area. Above these frescoes was a cornice or horizontal molding, projecting a couple of feet out from the wall. In the topmost third wall area were spaced the windows, on either side of them portraits of the Popes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Taking a deep breath, he craned his neck and looked up the more than sixty feet into the air at the ceiling itself, painted a light blue and studded with golden stars, the enormous area he was to fill with decorations. Arising out of the third level of the wall and going up into the curved vault were pendentives, which in turn were based on pilasters, column-like piers buried in the third tier. These pendentives, five on each wall and one at either end, constituted the open areas on which he was to paint the Twelve Apostles. Above each window was a semicircular lunette, outlined in sepia; the outer borders of the pendentives formed triangular spandrels, also colored in sepia.</p>

  <p class="normal">The motive for the commission now became crushingly clear to him. It was not to put magnificent paintings on the ceiling that would complement the earlier frescoes, but rather to mask the structural supports which made the harsh transition from the top third of the wall into the barrel vault. His Apostles were not to be created for themselves but rather to capture the gaze of people on the floor so that their attention would be diverted from the ungainly architectural divisions. As an artist he had become not merely a decorator but an obliterator of other men's clumsiness.</p>

  <p class="chapter">10.</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to Sangallo's, spent the rest of the day writing letters: to Argiento, urging him to hurry to Rome; to Granacci, pleading with him to come to Rome and organize a <i>bottega </i>for him; to the Topolinos, asking if they knew of a stonehewer who might like to come and help him mass the marble columns. In the morning a groom arrived from the Pope, informing him that the house where his earlier marbles had lain these two years was still available to him. He went to the Guffatti stoneyard, hired the family to haul the marbles from the Piazza San Pietro to the house. Several of the smaller blocks had been stolen.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could not find Cosimo, the carpenter; the neighbors thought he had died in Santo Spirito hospital; but that afternoon freckle-faced Piero Rosselli lurched in, laden with bundles, to cook his Livorno fish stew. While the <i>cacciucco </i>simmered in its orégano, Michelangelo and Rosselli examined the house, which had been unoccupied since Michelangelo abandoned it in haste two years before. The kitchen was of unpainted brick, small, but comfortable enough for cooking and eating. What had formerly been the family room could be converted into a tolerable workshop. The covered porch would hold all the marbles if they were carefully stacked; and the two unpainted brick bedrooms would sleep the <i>bottega.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">In May he signed his contract for the Sistine Chapel, was given five hundred large gold ducats from the papal purse. He paid his long-overdue debt to Balducci, returned to the furniture dealer in Trastevere to buy pieces that looked startlingly like the ones Balducci had sold back to the dealer eight years before. He hired a young Roman boy to take care of the house. The lad cheated on the market bills, so he let him go. The second boy stole several ducats out of Michelangelo's purse before he was caught.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci arrived at the end of the week. He had stopped off at a barber's to have his blond hair cut. He had already found the elegant men's shops on the Piazza Navona and brought to Michelangelo's house a new outfit of black trunk hose, a shirt, gold-embroidered hip-length cloak and a small ribbed cap, worn on the side of the head.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I never was so glad to see anybody in my life!" cried Michelangelo. "You must help me draw up a list of assistants."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not so fast," said Granacci, his light blue eyes dancing; "this is my first trip to Rome. I want to see the sights."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tomorrow I'll take you to the Colosseum, baths of Caracalla, the Capitoline hill..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All in good time. But tonight I want to visit the fashionable taverns I've heard about."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What would I know of such things? I'm a workingman. But if you're serious, I'll ask Balducci."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm always serious about my pleasures."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo drew two chairs up to the kichen table.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'd like to assemble the painters we worked with at Ghirlandaio's: Bugiardini, Tedesco, Cieco, Baldinelli, Jacopo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bugiardini will come. Tedesco, too, though I don't think he knows much more about painting now than he did at Ghirlandaio's. Jacopo will go anywhere on somebody else's money. But Cieco and Baldinelli, I don't know whether they're still in the art."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who can we get?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sebastiano da Sangallo, first of all. He considers himself a follower of yours, copies before your Bathers every day, gives lectures on it to new painters. I'll have to search for a fifth. It's not easy to get five painters all free at the same time."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let me give you a list of colors to send for. These Roman colors are no good at all."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci glanced shrewdly at his friend. "It appears to me that you don't find anything good in Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Does any Florentine?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm going to. I've heard about the sophisticated and beautiful courtesans who have the charming villas. As long as I must stay here to help you get that vault plastered, I'm going to find an exciting mistress."</p>

  <p class="normal">A letter brought him news that his uncle Francesco had died. Aunt Cassandra, after living with the family for forty years, had moved back to her parental home, starting suit against the Buonarroti to oblige them to return her dowry and to pay Francesco's debts. Though there had never been any real friendship between Michelangelo and his uncle, he had a strong blood-loyalty. He was grieved to see the next to last of the elder Buonarroti go. He was also worried. His father obviously intended him to fight Cassandra's lawsuit, hire a notary, see it through the courts....</p>

  <p class="normal">The next day he summoned up the courage to return to the Sistine. He found Bramante there, directing carpenters who were hanging a scaffolding from the ceiling by means of forty pipe-poles that had been driven through the cement vault and lashed together with ropes interlocked through the soldiers' quarters above.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's a scaffolding that will hold you securely for the rest of your life."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'd like to think so, Bramante, but actually it will only be a matter of months." Bramante stuck in his throat like a half-swallowed fly. The Pope by himself would hardly have thought of inflicting this ceiling on him. He inspected the scaffolding, knit his brows. "Just what do you intend to do with the holes in the ceiling after the poles come out?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Fill them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How do we get up to the holes to fill them after the scaffolding is down? Ride on an eagle's back?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...I hadn't thought of that."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nor of what we are to do with forty ugly cement fills in the middle of my painting after I have finished the job? Let's discuss it with the pontiff."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope was dictating <i>breves </i>simultaneously to several secretaries. Michelangelo laid out the situation in a few clear words.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I understand," said Julius. He turned a puzzled expression to Bramante. "What <i>did </i>you intend to do with those holes in the ceiling, Bramante?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Just leave them, the way we leave holes in the sides of buildings when we pull out the poles that hold up the scaffolding. It can't be helped."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is that true, Buonarroti?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Assuredly not, Holy Father. I will design a scaffold which will never touch the ceiling. Then the painting will remain perfect."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I believe you. Take down Bramante's scaffold and build your own. Chamberlain, you will pay the expenses for Buonarroti's new scaffold."</p>

  <p class="normal">As Michelangelo turned away he saw Bramante biting the corner of his lip.</p>

  <p class="normal">He ordered the carpenters to take down the scaffold. When all of the timber and rope had been lowered to the floor of the chapel, Mottino, the hunchbacked foreman of the carpenters, said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will be using these materials for your own scaffolding?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not the rope. You may have it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But it is valuable. You could sell it for a considerable sum."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is yours."</p>

  <p class="normal">Mottino was ecstatic. "This means I will have a dowry for my daughter. Now she can be married! They say in Rome that you are a difficult man, Messer Buonarroti. Now I see it is a lie. May God bless you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's precisely what I need, Mottino. God's blessing. Come back tomorrow."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night he tackled the problem inside his own head, which he found to be his best workshop. Since he had never seen such a scaffolding as he had promised the Pope, he would have to invent one. The chapel itself was divided into two parts, separated by Mino da Fiesole's carved screen: the half for laymen, which he was going to paint first, the larger division, or presbyterium, for cardinals. Then came the altar and the Pope's throne. On the rear wall was the fresco of the Assumption of the Virgin by his erstwhile enemy Perugino. The walls were thick and strong; they could stand any amount of pressure. If he built with planks that were solidly wedged against them, then the more weight put on his scaffold the more pressure it would apply and the more secure his framework would be. The problem was how to anchor the ends of his planks, since he could not cut niches into the walls. Then he remembered the projecting cornice; this ledge would not be strong enough to carry the weight of the scaffolding and men, but it could give his planks anchorage.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It might work," said Piero Rosselli, who frequently had to build his own scaffolding. He directed Mottino in the bolting of the planks and construction of the bridge. Michelangelo and Rosselli tested it, summoned the carpenter crew, one by one. The more weight on the trestle, the stronger it became. They were jubilant. It was a tiny victory, really; yet it provided the impetus to begin the detested chore.</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento wrote that he could not leave his brother's farm until the crops had been harvested. Neither could Granacci assemble a crew of assistants by mail.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll have to go to Florence and help them finish their commissions. It may take a couple of months, but I promise to bring back everyone you wanted."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll do the drawings. When you get back we'll be ready to start the cartoons."</p>

  <p class="normal">Summer clamped down. Miasmic vapors moved in from the marshes. No one could breathe. Half the city became ill with clogged heads and pain in the chest. Rosselli, his only companion during these stifling days, fled to the mountains. Michelangelo climbed the ladder to his trestle at dawn, savagely tormented for want of hammer and chisel in his hands. Instead he spent the airless days drawing scale models of the twelve pendentives where the Apostles would be painted, cutting out paper silhouettes of the lunettes and spandrels, which he would also have to fill with what the Pope had called customary decoration. By midmorning the vault was like a furnace, and he was gasping for breath. He slept as though drugged through the heat of the afternoon, then worked at night in the back garden, evolving designs for the nearly six thousand square feet of sky and stars that had to be replastered and made pretty.</p>

  <p class="normal">The hot days and weeks passed in lonely suffocation, broken only by the arrival of a former Settignano stonecutter whom his father had found in Florence, Michi by name, who had always wanted to visit Rome. Michi was about fifty, gnarled and pock-marked, sparely spoken, with the chipped, staccato accent of the stonehewer. Michi knew how to cook a few Settignano dishes; before his arrival Michelangelo had gone for days on bread and a thin wine.</p>

  <p class="normal">In September Granacci returned with a full <i>bottega </i>in tow. Michelangelo was amused by how much the former apprentices had aged: Jacopo was still slim, wiry, with darting black eyes to match the remnants of oily dark hair, and deeply etched laugh wrinkles; Tedesco, sporting a bushy beard several degrees more carroty than his hair, had become thickset, with a ponderous manner that made him the natural butt for Jacopo's jokes. Bugiardini, still moonfaced and round-eyed, showed a center patch of baldness that resembled a tonsure. Sebastiano da Sangallo, newcomer of the group, had developed a serious mien since Michelangelo had last seen him, which earned him the nickname of Aristotle. He wore luxuriant oriental mustaches which he grew in honor of his uncle Giuliano. Donnino, the only stranger to Michelangelo, had been brought by Granacci because "he's a good draftsman, the best of the lot." He was forty-two, looked like a hawk with a high-bridged thin nose in a long face with negligible slits for eyes and mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">That evening, after Granacci had made sure that his mistress, whom he had supported over the summer, was still waiting for him, the new <i>bottega </i>held a party. Granacci ordered in flagons of white Frascati wine and a dozen trays of food from the Trattoria Toscana. After three long pulls on the Frascati flagon, Jacopo told the story of the young man who went each evening to the Baptistery in Florence and prayed aloud for St. John to tell him about his wife's behavior and his son's future.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I hid behind the altar and called out, 'Your wife's a bawd, and your son will be hanged!' Do you know what he replied? 'You naughty St. John, you always did tell lies. That's why they cut your head off!'"</p>

  <p class="normal">When the laughter subsided, Bugiardini insisted on drawing Michelangelo's face. When he had finished, Michelangelo exclaimed, "Bugiardini, you still have one of my eyes in my temple!" Next they played the drawing game on Donnino, letting him win so that he would have to buy the next day's dinner.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo bought a second large bed in Trastevere. He, Bugiardini and Sangallo slept in the room off the workshop, while Jacopo, Tedesco and Donnino slept in the room down the hall. Bugiardini and Sangallo went out to buy sawhorses and planks, set up a worktable in the center of the room long enough for all six of them. At ten o'clock Granacci arrived. Jacopo cried, "Careful, everybody, don't let Granacci pick up anything heavier than charcoal, or he'll collapse in a heap."</p>

  <p class="normal">Officially baptized by this buffoonery, the studio set to work in earnest. Michelangelo laid out on the table before them the scale drawings of the ceiling. The large pendentives at either end of the chapel he reserved for St. Peter and St. Paul; in the five smaller pendentives on one side would be Matthew, John and Andrew, Bartholomew and James the Great, on the opposite wall James the Less, Judas called Thaddaeus, Philip, Simon and Thomas. He sketched one complete Apostle, sitting on a high-backed throne, pilasters on either side; above were winged caryatids on C-shaped volutes, with medallions in square fields and scroll-like ornaments.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the first week in October the house had fallen into chaos, for no one thought to make a bed, wash a dish or sweep a floor. Argiento came in from Ferrara, was so delighted to find that he was to have six companions in the house that he washed and scrubbed and polished for days, in addition to cooking the meals, before he got around to being unhappy about Michelangelo's commission.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I want to work stone. Be a <i>scultore."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"So do I, Argiento. And so we shall, if only you'll be patient and help me get that ceiling splashed with paint."</p>

  <p class="normal">To each of his six assistants he assigned a division of the vault for decoration: rosettes, <i>cassettoni, </i>circles and rectangles, trees and flowers with spreading foliage, wavelike movements of undulating lines, spirals. Michi, he discovered, was adept at grinding colors. He himself would do the final cartoons for most of the Apostles, but Granacci could paint a couple of them, and perhaps Donnino and Sangallo could each do one. He had already spent five months getting to this day, but now that he had them all together and started, he felt certain he could cover the whole ceiling in seven months. That would be another year out of his life. A total of four since he had first come to Rome to confer with Pope Julius. He would finish by May, and then either go to work on the marble figures for the tomb or return to the Hercules block which Gonfaloniere Soderini had brought to Florence for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">It did not quite work that way. Donnino, though he was as fine a draftsman as Granacci said, lacked the courage to venture past his sketches into the colored cartoons. Jacopo kept them entertained but did no more work at thirty-five than he had at fifteen. Tedesco painted poorly. Sangallo dared anything Michelangelo put him on, but he was still inexperienced. Bugiardini was solidly reliable, but just as at Ghirlandaio's he could paint only flat walls and windows, thrones and pilasters. Granacci's cartoon for his Apostle came out well, but Granacci was having a good time in Rome. Since he had refused to take a salary, how could Michelangelo oblige him to put in more work hours? Michelangelo worked twice as hard as he had thought he would have to, and made slow progress through the weeks of November.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last the time arrived, during the first week of December, when they were ready to fresco a major zone of the ceiling. One of the Apostles was his, the St. John on the side; opposite, Granacci was to paint St. Thomas. The others on the scaffold, led by Bugiardini, were to paint the decorations on the barrel vault between the two Apostles. Piero Rosselli had laid a heavy coat of intonaco on the area the day before, hatching a rough surface on which, this morning, he would plaster the precise area to be painted by dark.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn they set out for the Sistine, Michi driving the donkey, the cart loaded with pails, brushes, tubes of paint, cartoons, bundles of sketches, pointing sticks, pots and bottles for color, with Rosselli sitting in the midst of sand and lime. Michelangelo and Granacci walked ahead, Bugiardini and Sangallo just behind them, Tedesco, Jacopo and Donnino bringing up the rear. Michelangelo felt hollow at the pit of his stomach, but Granacci was in a gay mood.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How do you feel, Master Buonarroti? Did you ever imagine you would be walking at the head of your own <i>bottega </i>to begin a fresco commission?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not in my wildest nightmares."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good thing we were all so patient with you. Remember how the Ghirlandaios taught you to use the instruments for squaring up? How Mainardi showed you to tint flesh in tempera, and David showed you how to make brushes from white pigs... ?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"And Cieco and Baldinelli called me a fraud because I wouldn't paint wings on an angel? Oh, Granacci, what have I got myself into? I'm no fresco painter!"</p>

  <p class="chapter">11.</p>

  <p class="normal">The group worked well together, Michi mixing the plaster on the scaffold after hauling the sacks up the ladder, Rosselli expertly laying the daily area to be painted, remaining to watch its drying rate and to keep it sprinkled. Even Jacopo worked hard to copy the cartoon colors into the designs that Bugiardini had outlined with an ivory stick.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the paint had had time to oxidize and dry, Michelangelo returned alone to study the result. With a seventh of the vault completed, he was able to see what the entire ceiling would be like when they had frescoed the rest. The Pope's objective would be accomplished; no one would be disturbed any more by the projecting spandrels, loomingly empty lunettes or the broken-up vault with its monotonous circles of gold stars. The Apostles on their thrones, the thousands of square feet of brightly colored designs would conceal and divert.</p>

  <p class="normal">But what about the quality of the work? It was in the marrow of his bones to create only the finest he could produce; to create far beyond his abilities because he could be content with nothing that was not new, fresh, different, a palpable extension of the whole of the art. He had never compromised with quality; his integrity as a man and an artist was the rock on which his life was built. If he split that rock by indifference, by giving less than the exhausting best of himself, if he were content merely to get by, what was left of him?</p>

  <p class="normal">He could have done the bronze statue of Pope Julius twice as fast had he been satisfied with a merely adequate statue; no one would have criticized him, since bronze was not his trade, and the commission had been forced upon him. But he had spent energy-draining months determined that his work must bring honor upon himself and his family and all artists. Had be been willing or able to do an immediately conceivable bronze of Julius it would perhaps be easier now to do this conceivable ceiling fresco. He and his group could apply the remaining paint without much trouble. But he could not deny that the quality was mediocre. He told Giuliano da Sangallo so.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have done your best under the circumstances," replied his friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo paced the Sangallo drawing room, hugging his arms about him, perturbed. "I'm a long way from convinced of that."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No one will blame you. The Pope gave you a job, and you did as you were told. Who could do otherwise?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Me. If I walk away from this ceiling as it is, I'll despise myself."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why must you take things so hard?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"If there is one thing I know for sure it's that, when I hold a hammer and chisel in my hands and start that 'Go,' I need my full assurance that I can do no wrong. I need my complete self-respect. Once let me know that I can be content with inferior work..." There was agony in his voice, a pleading with Sangallo to affirm this concept. "...and as an artist, I'm through."</p>

  <p class="normal">He kept the <i>bottega </i>busy designing the cartoons for the next area of the ceiling. He said nothing of his dilemma. Yet a crisis was impending; he could not take the studio up to the top of the scaffold and cover another area with paint which he knew would not remain. They were only ten days away from blowing up the next cartoons to full size. He would have to reach a decision.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was temporarily spared by the advent of Christmas. The Rome celebrations, starting considerably in advance, gave him a reason to suspend work without revealing the turmoil going on within him. The studio was overjoyed at the vacation.</p>

  <p class="normal">He received a note from Cardinal Giovanni. Would Michelangelo join them for dinner on Christmas Day? This was the first word he had heard from Giovanni since his monumental battle with the Pope. He bought himself a handsome brown woolen shirt, the first in several years, a pair of matching hose and a cloak of beige camlet that lightened the color of his amber eyes. He went to mass at San Lorenzo in Daniaso, where his Christmas spirit was shattered at seeing the church so forlorn now that it was stripped of its glorious stone columns.</p>

  <p class="normal">A groom with Florentine lilies embroidered on his livery admitted him to Cardinal Giovanni's palace on the Via Ripetta. As he passed through the spacious entrance hall with its majestic stairway, and then a drawing room and music room, he was able to perceive how greatly Cardinal Giovanni had profited from his benefices. There were new paintings on the walls, ancient sculptures from Asia Minor on pedestals, cabinets of antique coins, carved gems. He moved slowly, studying the recent acquisitions, marveling that of his father's formidable genius Giovanni should have inherited only this one facet: flawless good taste in the arts.</p>

  <p class="normal">He came up sharp at the entrance to the smaller of the drawing rooms. There, sitting before a log fire, her hands extended to the flames, and high color in her alabaster cheeks, sat Contessina. She looked up.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Contessina."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Come va?"</span></i></p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Non c'è male."</span></i></p>

  <p class="normal">"As the Settignano stonecutter says."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't have to ask how you are. You look beautiful."</p>

  <p class="normal">The color mounted higher in her cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You've never said that before."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I've always thought it."</p>

  <p class="normal">She rose, came close to him. Her scent was the one she had used as a child in the Medici palace. Nostalgia for those happy years swept over him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are a deep part of me. From the days when my life began. In the sculpture garden."</p>

  <p class="normal">Her eyes filled with pain and joy in equal measure.</p>

  <p class="normal">"As you have always been a part of me."</p>

  <p class="normal">He became aware of the others around them, changed his tone.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Luigi and Niccolò, they are well?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They are here with me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And Ridolfi?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you are not staying?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Giovanni has taken me to see the Pope. The Holy Father has promised to intercede with the Signoria for us. But I cannot hope. My husband is committed to the downfall of the Republic. He never loses an opportunity to make his views known..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know."</p>

  <p class="normal">They smiled at each other, wistfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is not discreet of him, but it is his resolve." She stopped abruptly, studied his face. "I have talked about myself. Now I want to speak of you."</p>

  <p class="normal">He shrugged his shoulders. "I fight, but always I lose."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The work does not go well?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not yet."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It will."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll put my hand in fire."</p>

  <p class="normal">She held her hand out toward him as though it were already in the searing heat of the flames. He longed to take it in his own, if only for a moment. Then she threw back her head in laughter at the drastic Tuscan phrase of affirmation. Now their laughter joined together, seized each other and held close, harmoniously, intertwined through each other's fabric and substance. This too, he knew, was a kind of possessing; rare, beautiful and sacred.</p>

  <p class="normal">The <i>campagna romana </i>was not Tuscany; it did not fill him with an all-absolving lyrical grace. But it had power, and history: the flat, fertile plains rolling for miles, traversed by the remains of Roman aqueducts that had brought clean water down from the hills; Hadrian's villa, where the Emperor had re-created the glory of Greece and Asia Minor, and where Michelangelo watched the excavators unearth marbles that went back to the generations of Pericles; Tivoli, with its majestic waterfalls, favorite holiday village for the Romans of the Empire; the Castelli Romani, a series of towns located on the lava and tufa slopes of the volcanic Alban Hills, each village on its separate peak in a series of peaks surrounding an enormous crater, with other ranges, covered by dark green forests, rolling back sculpturally as did the mountains beyond Settignano: Frascati, Tusculum, higher into the hills, where he wandered among the ruins of Cicero's villa, the amphitheater, forum, buried temple; the hills dotted with tiny stone villages whose origins were lost in obscure ages of history: before the Romans, before the Etruscans; the Temple of Fortune at Praeneste, whose walls included an entire village, with a Cave of Destiny and crypts that dated from who knew what distant age of man?</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked deeper and deeper into the past, circling the enormous rim of the volcano, coming across carved building stones that had been spilled over the ground like milk, beneath which lay ancient settlements. Each night he stopped at a tiny inn or knocked on the door of a <i>contadino </i>family to buy his supper and space on a bed to rest, gripping the magnificent mountains between his legs, the irresilient tufa beneath his feet, filled with the delicious pulsating fatigue that beat up from his soles and ankles and calves and knees and thighs into his groin.</p>

  <p class="normal">The deeper he penetrated into the eon-old past of the volcanic hills and civilizations, the clearer his own problem became for him. His helpers would have to go. Many marble masters had permitted their apprentices and assistants to hew the marble block to within a safe margin of the central figure, but he had to hammer off the corners, mass the edges, work the four flat sides, remove every last crystal himself. He did not have the nature of a Ghirlandaio, able to do the main figures and focal scenes, allow the <i>bottega </i>to do the rest. He had to work alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">He paid no attention to passing time; the days seemed so infinitesimal among the lost ages of the lava rock. In lieu of time he was conscious of space, trying to fit himself into the core of the Sistine vault as he had into the center of the Duccio block, so that he would know its weight and mass, grasp what it might hold and what might break off in imbalance. He had cleared the fields, plowed, seeded, stood with his head in the sun and the rain. Nothing showed; the thin, bright green miracle announcing the beginning of new life remained below the surface of his mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">On New Year's morning, with his country hosts celebrating the first day of the Year of Our Lord 1509, he left their stone hut in the mountains, mounted higher and higher along the sheep trail until he came to the summit. The air was sharp, clear and cold. As he stood on the peak, muffler wound around his mouth to keep his teeth from freezing, the sun came up behind him, over the most distant range to which his eye could travel. As the sun rose in the sky the <i>campagna </i>plains came to life in pale pinks and tawny browns. In the distance stood Rome, sparklingly clear. Beyond and to the south lay the Tyrrhenian Sea, pastel green under a brittle blue winter sky. The whole landscape was flooded with luminosity: forests, the descending ranges beneath him, the hills, towns, the fertile plains, the somnolent farms, the stone-pile villages, the mountain and sea roads leading to Rome, a ship on the ocean....</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverentially he thought, "What a magnificent artist was God when He created the universe: sculptor, architect, painter: He who originally conceived space, filled it with His wonders." He remembered the lines from the beginning of Genesis:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>God, at the beginning of time, created heaven and earth. Earth was still an empty waste, and darkness hung over the deep.... Then God said. Let there be light.... God said too, Let a solid vault arise amid the waters.... a vault by which God would separate the waters which were beneath it from the waters above it... This vault God called the Sky....</i></p>

  <p class="normal">...vault... God too had been faced with the need to create within a vault! And what had He created? Not merely the sun and moon and heavens of the sky, but a whole teeming world below it. Sentences, phrases, images flooded his mind from the Book of Genesis:</p>

  <p class="block2indent">...God said, Let the waters below the vault collect in one place to make dry land appear... the dry land God called Earth, and the water, where it had collected, He called the Sea.... Let the earth, He said, yield grasses that grow and seed....</p>

  <p class="block2indent">...God said, Let the waters produce moving things... and winged things that fly above the earth under the sky's vault.</p>

  <p class="block2indent">...And God said, Let us make man, wearing our own image and likeness; let us put him in command of the fishes in the sea, and all that flies through the air, and the cattle and the whole earth, and all the creeping things that move on earth. So God made man in His own image, made him in the image of God. Man and woman both, He created them....</p>

  <p class="normal">And Michelangelo knew, just as clearly as he had known anything in his life, that nothing would suffice for his vault but Genesis itself, a re-creation of the universe. What nobler work of art could there be than God's creating of the sun and moon, the water and the earth, the evolving of man, of woman? He would create the world in that Sistine ceiling as though it were being created for the first time. There was a theme to conquer that vault! The only one that could so overwhelm it that all of its ugliness and clumsy architecture would vanish as though it never existed, and in its place would come the glory of God's architecture.</p>

  <p class="chapter">12.</p>

  <p class="normal">He asked Chamberlain Accursio if he might see the Pope alone for a few moments. The chamberlain arranged the meeting for late in the afternoon. Julius was sitting quietly in the small throne room with just one secretary remaining, dictating a letter to Venice, the Vatican's strongest opponent in Italy. Michelangelo kneeled.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, I have come to speak to you about the Sistine vault."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, my son?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had no sooner painted one section than I realized it would turn out meanly."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why so?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because the placing of the Apostles alone will have but a poor effect. They occupy too small an area of the total ceiling and become lost."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But there are other decorations."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have begun these decorations, as you instructed me. They make the Apostles seem poorer than ever."</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is your best judgment, that at the end we will emerge with a poor effect?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have given the matter a great deal of thought, and that is my honest opinion. No matter how well the ceiling may be painted under the original plan, it can bring little honor to either of us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"When you speak quietly this way, Buonarroti, I hear truth in you. I can also tell that you have not come to ask permission to abandon the work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, Holy Father. I have a composition that will cover the entire vault with glory."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have confidence in you, and so I shall not ask the nature of your design. But I shall come often to the chapel to watch your progress. You are involving yourself in three times as much work?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...or five or six."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope stirred on his throne, rose, paced up and down the room, then came to a halt before Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are a strange one, Buonarroti. You screamed that fresco was not your profession, and almost knocked me down in your rage. Yet now, eight months later, you come back with a plan that will entail infinitely more time and labor. How is one to understand you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know," replied Michelangelo ruefully. "I hardly understand myself. I only know that since I must paint that vault I cannot bring you something mediocre, even if it is all you have asked for."</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius shook his white-haired, white-bearded head in amused puzzlement. Then he put his hand on Michelangelo's head, blessed him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Paint your ceiling as you will. We cannot pay you five or six times the original three thousand ducats, but we will double it to six thousand."</p>

  <p class="normal">His next task was more delicate and more difficult. He had to tell Granacci that the <i>bottega </i>was finished, that the assistants would have to go home. He took him step by step along the tortuous trail.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will keep Michi to grind the colors, and Rosselli will lay the wet plaster. The rest I simply must do by myself."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci was staggered. "I never really thought that you could manage a studio as Ghirlandaio did. But you wanted to try, and so I helped you.... But working alone on top of that scaffolding to re-create the story of Genesis will take you forty years!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, closer to four."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci put his arms about his friend's shoulders, quoted softly, "'If a lion or bear came and carried off one of my rams, I would snatch the prey from their jaws. Did they threaten me, I would catch them by the throat and strangle them.' As an artist, you have David's courage."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am also a coward. I can't bear to tell the others. Would you do it for me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to the Sistine to look at the vault with sharper eyes. The architectural structure did not accommodate his new vision. He needed a new vault, a completely different ceiling which would appear to have been constructed solely for the purpose of showing his frescoes to their best advantage. But he knew better than to return to the Pope and ask for a million ducats to tear down brick, plaster, soldiers' rooms above, solid roof beyond. Serving as his own architect, he would have to rebuild that tremendous vault with the sole material available to him:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>Paint.</span></i></p>

  <p class="normal">Through sheer invention he must transform the ceiling, utilizing its shortcomings even as he had the gouge in the Duccio block, to force his creative powers into channels they might not otherwise have taken. Either he was the stronger, and could displace this vault space, or the force of the vault to resist would crush him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was determined to get a teeming humanity up on the ceiling, as well as God Almighty who created it; mankind portrayed in its breathless beauty, its weaknesses, its indestructible strengths: God in His ability to make all things possible. He must project a throbbing, meaningful vitality that would invert the universe: the vault would become the reality, the world of those looking at it would become illusion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento and Michi built a workbench for him in the center of the icy marble floor. Now he knew what the vault must say and accomplish; the number of frescoes he could paint would be determined by his architectural reconstruction. He must create the content and the container simultaneously. He stared at the ceiling above him. The center space running the full length of the vault he would use for his major legends: Dividing the Waters from the Earth. God Creating the Sun, the Moon. God Creating Adam and Eve, Expelling Them from the Garden, the legend of Noah and the Deluge. Now, at long last, he could pay his debt to Della Quercia for the magnificent biblical scenes carved in Istrian stone on the portal of San Petronio.</p>

  <p class="normal">Architecturally he must frame this crucial middle section; he must also make the long narrow vault visible as a unified whole, with a single impact. For all practical purposes he had not one ceiling to paint, but three. He was going to have to be a magician to achieve a unifying force which would embrace every portion of the walls and ceiling, tie the elements together so that each supported the other, and no figure or scene would be isolated.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took weeks of concentration, but at length the solution emerged from the severest limitation of the ceiling: the eight heavy, obtruding triangular spandrels, four on each side, their apexes coming a third of the way into the vault, and the four double-sized spandrels at the ends, with their inverted apexes in the corners, he spent a hundred hours trying to design them out, so that they would not dominate the ceiling, before he saw that he had been thinking in reverse. He must transform them into assets by decorating them with rich sculptural designs; then they would constitute a continuous frieze, an outer frame for the whole of his inner design!</p>

  <p class="normal">Ideas now came tumbling over each other so tumultuously that he could hardly move his hands fast enough to set them down. The twelve pendentives between the apexes of the spandrels on the ends and sides he would preserve for his Prophets and Sibyls, sitting each one on a spacious marble throne. Connecting these twelve thrones would be a marble-like cornice going around all four sides of the chapel; this strong architectural cornice would serve as a cohesive interior frame to encompass his nine central stories. On either side of each throne would be marble-appearing <i>putti; </i>above them, enclosing the panels at the corners, would be the glorious male youth of the world, twenty nudes, their figures facing away from the giant panels toward the smaller panels, filling the released corners.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Rosselli mounted the scaffolding with a claw hammer to tear out the plaster already frescoed, with Michi holding a canvas catchall below, Argiento came to Michelangelo. There were tears in his muddy brown eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Argiento, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"My brother is dead."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo put a hand on the young man's shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm so sorry."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have to go home. The family farm is mine now. I must work it. My brother left little children. I'll be a <i>contadino. </i>I marry my brother's wife, raise the children."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo laid down his pen.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You don't like living on the farm."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'll be up on that scaffold a long time. I don't like paint."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo rested his head wearily on his hands. "Neither do I, Argiento. But I'm going to paint those figures as though they were carved out of a stone mass. Every one of them will look as though they could move right off that ceiling and come down to earth."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's still paint."</p>

  <p class="normal">"When will you leave?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Today, after dinner."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will miss you."</p>

  <p class="normal">He paid Argiento's back wages, thirty-seven gold ducats. This was almost the last of his funds. He had received no money from the Pope since May, nine months before; he had bought his furniture and paints, plastered a section of the ceiling and frescoed it, paid the wages and travel expenses of Jacopo, Tedesco, Sangallo, Donnino, Bugiardini, fed them for four months. He could not even consider asking the Pope for more funds until he had an important section of the ceiling finished. Yet how could he paint even one complete panel until he had designed the entire vault? That meant months of drawing before he could start his first fresco. And now, just when he would become most involved, there would be no one to cook a meal, sweep a floor or wash a shirt.</p>

  <p class="normal">He ate his soup-of-the-country in the silent house, thinking back to the month that it had been so noisy and gay, with Jacopo telling stories, Aristotle giving a lecture on the Bathers, Bugiardini singing love songs about Florence. It would be quiet here now; but it would be lonelier still, all alone on the scaffolding in the barren chapel.</p>

  <p class="chapter">13.</p>

  <p class="normal">He began with the Deluge, a large panel toward the entrance of the chapel. By March he had the cartoon blown up and ready to be transferred to the ceiling. Winter had not released its grip on Rome. The Sistine was bitterly cold. A hundred braziers could not heat its lowest areas. He wore his warm wool stockings, <i>brache </i>and shirt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rosselli, who had left for Orvieto for a profitable commission, had trained Michi in the mixing of the plaster and the method of applying it. Michelangelo helped him carry the sacks of lime, sand and <i>pozzolana, </i>volcanic tufa dust, up the steep wall ladders to the top of the scaffolding. Here Michi made his mix. Michelangelo was dissatisfied with the tawny color caused by the <i>pozzolana, </i>adding more lime and ground marble. He and Michi then climbed the series of three receding platforms that Rosselli had built so that they could plaster and paint the top of the rolling vault. Michi laid an area of intonaco, then held the cartoon. Michelangelo used the stick, charcoal bag, red ochre for connecting lines.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michi descended, set to work grinding colors below. Michelangelo was now on his top platform, sixty feet above the floor. He had been thirteen when he stood for the first time on the scaffolding in Santa Maria Novella, alone on a peak above the chapel and the world. Now he was thirty-four, and now, as then, he suffered vertigo. The Sistine seemed so hollow from up here, with his head just one foot below the ceiling. He smelled the wet plaster, the pungence of his freshly ground paints. He turned from his view of the marble floor, picked up a brush, squeezed it between the fingers and thumb of his left hand, remembering that he would have to keep his colors liquid this early in the morning....</p>

  <p class="normal">He had watched Ghirlandaio paint enough panels to know that he should begin at the top and work his way downward on either side; but he lacked experience to paint professionally, and so he began at the dominant point, the one that interested him the most: the extreme left end, the last piece of green earth showing above the flood, the trunk of a storm-twisted tree extending toward what would later be Noah's Ark, with the last of perishing humanity climbing the banks: a woman carrying a child in her arms, an older one clutching her leg; a husband carrying his distraught wife on his back; a vanishing trail of heads, old and young, about to be submerged in the rising waters; and above them all, a young man climbing and clutching at the tree trunk in a desperate effort to gain the highest vantage point.</p>

  <p class="normal">He painted with his head and shoulders pulled sharply back, his eyes staring straight up. Paint dripped onto his face, the moisture of the wet plaster oozed out and dripped in his eyes. His arms and back tired quickly from the strain of the unnatural position. During the first week he allowed Michi to lay only modest areas of intonaco each day, proceeding cautiously, experimenting not only with the contortions of the figures but with a wide variety of flesh tones and the colors of the blue, green and rose robes of those who still retained their clothing. He knew that these small areas caused too many seams, that at this rate Granacci's estimate of forty years would prove more accurate than his own resolution of four. Yet he learned as he went along; this panel of life and death in violent action bore little relation to the Ghirlandaio still lifes. He was content to feel his way slowly until he had mastered his medium.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the end of the first week a biting north wind arose. Its whistling kept him awake most of the night. In the morning he walked to the Sistine with his scarf wound around his mouth, not sure, even as he climbed the ladder, whether he could get his hands warm enough to hold a brush. But when he reached the top of Rosselli's highest platform he saw that there was no need to do so: his panel was ruined. His plaster and paints were not drying. Instead, there was a moist dripping at the edges of his stormy tree, the man mounting the bank, a bundle of clothes on his shoulder. The oozing moisture was creating a mold which was creeping over the paint, slowly absorbing it. Behind him he heard Michi ask in a choked voice:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I made the plaster bad?"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a long time before he could reply; he felt too sick.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It was me. I don't know how to mix paints for fresco. It's been too many years since Ghirlandaio's. Granacci and the others did the work on my first prophet; all I did was apply the paint."</p>

  <p class="normal">He stumbled down the ladder, tears in his eyes, made his way blindly to the Papal palace, waited for an interminable time in a cold anteroom. When he was admitted he stood forlornly before Julius.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is it, my son? You look ill."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have failed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In what way?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What I have done is spoiled."</p>

  <p class="normal">"So quickly?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I told Your Holiness it was not my art."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Lift up your head, Buonarroti. I have never seen you... crushed. I prefer you storming at me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The ceiling has begun to drip. The moisture is causing spots of mold."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can't you dry them?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know not how, Holiness. My colors are disappearing into the mold. They are being consumed by the salty edges."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't believe that you would fail...." He turned to a groom. "Go to Sangallo's house, tell him to inspect the Sistine ceiling at once, and bring me his report."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo retreated to the cold outer room and the hard waiting bench. This was the worst defeat he had ever suffered. Much as he hated giving his years to fresco, he had nonetheless evolved a masterly conception. He was not accustomed to failure; it was the only thing in his lexicon that was worse than being forced to work in alien mediums. That the Pope would be through with him there could be no doubt, even though his collapse as a fresco painter had nothing to do with his qualities as a marble sculptor. He would certainly not be allowed to carve the tomb. When an artist failed this abjectly, he was finished. The news of his failure would be all over Italy in a matter of days. Instead of returning to Florence in triumph he would creep home like a beaten dog, the tail of his pride between his legs. Florence would not like that. They would consider that he had undermined their position in the art world. Gonfaloniere Soderini would feel let down; he would have been a liability at the Vatican instead of an asset. Again he would have wasted a full year of his productive life.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was buried so deep in his gloom that he did not see Sangallo come in. He was hustled into the throne room before he had a chance to collect himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sangallo, what have you found?" the Pope demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nothing serious, Holiness. Michelangelo applied the lime in too watery a state, and the north wind caused it to exude."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But it's the same composition Ghirlandaio used in Florence," Michelangelo cried. "I watched it being prepared...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Roman lime is made of travertine. It does not dry as readily. The <i>pozzolana </i>Rosselli taught you to mix with it stays soft, and often breaks into an efflorescence while drying. Substitute marble dust for <i>pozzolana, </i>use less water with this lime. All will be well."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What about my colors? Must I tear out that part of the ceiling?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. In time the air will consume the mold. Your colors won't be hurt."</p>

  <p class="normal">Had Sangallo come back and reported that the ceiling was ruined, he would have been on the road to Florence by noon. Now he could return to his vault, though the events of the morning had given him an excruciating headache.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wind died down. The sun came out. His plaster dried. It was Sangallo who traveled the long road of defeat back to Florence. When Michelangelo went to the house on the Piazza Scossacavalli he found the furniture covered with sheets, the family's personal possessions stacked in the downstairs hall. Michelangelo was heartbroken.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What has happened?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo shook his bead, lips pursed tightly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No commissions have come in, not the Palazzo Giuliano, the Mint, the new palaces. Do you know the only assignment I have now? Laying sewers under the main streets! A noble job for a papal architect, no? My apprentices have joined Bramante. He has taken my place, as he vowed he would."</p>

  <p class="normal">The next morning Sangallo and his family were gone, their departure unnoticed by the Vatican. High on his scaffold, Michelangelo felt more alone in Rome than ever; as though it were he who was lying melancholy and hopeless on the last gray rocks still above the sea, opposite the last bit of green earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Deluge took him thirty-two days of consecutive painting. During the last weeks he was completely out of funds. "We don't know whether we're rubbing the skin of our belly or the bone of our back," commented Michi.</p>

  <p class="normal">His former earnings, invested in houses and farms to increase the family income, helped him not a scudo's worth. On the contrary, every letter still brought laments: why wasn't he sending his brothers money to open their shop? Lodovico money to buy fertile farms he had located? Why wasn't he arranging to have Aunt Cassandra's suit transferred to Rome, where he could defend it? At this point he felt like one of the naked men in the center of his panel, trying to climb into Noah's boat where other agonized men, fearing for the safety of their last refuge, were standing above him with clubs raised.</p>

  <p class="normal">How was it that only he did not prosper from his papal connections? Young Raphael Sanzio, recently brought to Rome by Bramante, his fellow countryman from Urbino, and an old friend of the Sanzio family, had immediately secured a private commission. The Pope had been so delighted with the grace and charm of the work that he had commissioned Raphael to fresco the <i>Stanze, </i>the rooms of his new apartment, into which he was moving from the detested Borgia apartment. The frescoes that had already been started by Signorelli and Sodoma the Pope ordered painted out, so that Raphael's work alone would be seen. Paid a generous retainer by the Pope, Raphael had rented a luxuriously furnished villa, installed a beautiful young mistress and a staff of servants to care for them. Raphael was already surrounded by admirers and apprentices, garnering the ripe fruits of Rome. The Pope included him in his hunting parties and private dinners. He was to be seen everywhere, petted, loved, everyone bringing him new commissions, including the decorating of a summer pavilion for Chigi, the banker.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gazed at the unpainted brick walls of his house, drab, without curtains or carpets, just the few pieces of used furniture he had bought. When Raphael arrived in Rome, Michelangelo had expected him to come and say hello. But Raphael never bothered to walk the few steps to the Sistine or to the house.</p>

  <p class="normal">One evening when Michelangelo was crossing Piazza San Pietro, returning from the vault with his hair, face and clothes bespattered with paint and plaster, he saw Raphael coming toward him, surrounded by a full train of admirers, apprentices and hangers-on. As they passed, Michelangelo said dryly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where are you going, as surrounded as a rector?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Raphael did not stop but replied tartly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"And where are you going, as lonely as an executioner?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The remark rankled. The fact that his isolation was self-imposed did not help. He went to his drafting table, burying his hunger and loneliness in work, sketching the next fresco, the Sacrifice of Noah. As the figures came alive under his swiftly moving fingers and mind, Noah and his wife, the three nude sons of Noah, their wives, the ram to be sacrificed to the Lord, his workroom filled up with energy and vividness, vitality and color. His hunger, his sense of isolation receded. He felt secure among his companions in this world of his own creating. To the silent house he murmured:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm never less alone than when alone."</p>

  <p class="normal">And he sighed, for he knew himself to be a victim of his own character.</p>

  <p class="chapter">14.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Julius had been eagerly waiting a chance to see the first fresco, but destitute as he was, Michelangelo took another ten days to paint the Delphic Sibyl and the Prophet Joel on their thrones in the pendentives on either side of the smaller fresco of Noah's Drunkenness. He wanted the Pope to see good examples of the figures with which the central panels would be surrounded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius climbed the ladder, joined Michelangelo on the scaffolding, studied the fifty-five men, women and children, a few showing only heads and shoulders, but most of them fully presented. He commented on the magnificent beauty of the dark-haired Delphic Sibyl, asked questions about the white-maned father carrying his dead son onto the rocks, Noah's Ark in the background looking somewhat like a Greek temple, inquired about what was going to be painted in the other areas. Michelangelo avoided direct answers; he needed freedom to change his ideas as he moved along. Julius was too pleased to mind. He said quietly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The rest of the ceiling will be as good?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It should be better, Holy Father, for I am still learning about proper perspective at this height."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is wholly unlike the frescoes below us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The differences will grow greater as I proceed, rather than less."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am pleased with you, my son. I shall order the treasurer to pay you another five hundred ducats."</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he was able to send money home to still the outcries, to buy food for the house, needed supplies for the job; now there would be quiet months ahead, during which he could paint his way toward the Garden of Eden, God Creating Eve, and then the heart of the ceiling, God Creating Adam.</p>

  <p class="normal">The months proved anything but quiet. Warned by friendly Chamberlain Accursio that his Pietà was being moved out of St. Peter's so that Bramante's army of twenty-five hundred workmen could tear out the south wall of the Basilica to make room for the first of the new piers, he ran up the long flight of stairs to find his Pietà already moved next door to the little chapel of Mary of the Fever, but undamaged. Relieved, he stood watching Bramante's foremen locking cables around the south row of ancient columns; then, unbelieving, and with a sickening sinking of his innards, he saw the ancient marble and granite columns shatter to bits as they fell to the stone floor, be swept up as rubble and hauled away. Monuments built into the south wall were destroyed as the wall collapsed, smashing the antique mosaic tiles of the floor. At so little cost they could have been removed to safety!</p>

  <p class="normal">Two mornings later a paper was pasted on the door of Bramante's palace, changing his name to Ruinante. A story circulated through the city that Bramante, knocking at the gates of paradise, was refused admission by St. Peter, who asked, "Why did you destroy my temple in Rome?" In reply, Bramante asked whether St. Peter would like him to tear down heaven and rebuild it.</p>

  <p class="normal">As far as he knew, no one but himself and Chamberlain Accursio had a key to the Sistine. He had insisted upon this, so that no one could spy, or intrude upon his privacy. While painting the Prophet Zacharias on the huge throne over the layman's end of the chapel, he had a feeling that someone was coming at night. He had no tangible evidence, nothing was touched or moved out of place; but he sensed that not everything was quite the way he left it. Someone was mounting the ladder.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michi hid in a nearby doorway, brought back word that it was Bramante and, he believed, Raphael. Bramante had a key. They came in late, after midnight. Michelangelo was furious: before he could get his vault completed and open to view, his new techniques would be on the walls of Raphael's <i>Stanze, </i>even as Raphael's work now reflected his study of the Bathers. Raphael would have created the revolution, and Michelangelo copying him!</p>

  <p class="normal">He asked Chamberlain Accursio to arrange a session with the Pope. Michelangelo made the accusation: there would be nothing new, no point of departure that Raphael would not know about...</p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante stood silent. Michelangelo demanded that the key be taken away from him. The Pope requested Bramante to surrender it to Accursio. Another crisis had been met. Michelangelo returned to the vault.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next day there came a summons from a niece of Cardinal Piccolomini, who had so briefly been Pope Pius III. The Piccolomini family insisted that he begin carving on the remaining eleven statues for the Siena altar, or return the hundred-florin advance secured for him by Jacopo Galli. He could not spare a hundred florins now. Besides, they still owed him for one of the figures he had already delivered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next a letter from Lodovico informed him that, while he was making some repairs to the house in Settignano, Giovansimone had quarreled with his father, raised his fist and threatened to beat him, then had set fire to the house and barn. The damage was small, since both structures were built of stone, but the experience had made Lodovico ill. Michelangelo sent money to make the repairs, along with a blistering letter to his brother.</p>

  <p class="normal">The four incidents upset him severely. He had to stop work. A marble hunger seized him with such palpable force that he felt weak. He made for the <i>campagna, </i>walked for miles with long ceaseless strides, breathed in heavy gulps of air to prove to himself that he was three-dimensional. In the midst of his despair he received a message from Cardinal Giovanni, summoning him to the Medici palace. What else could have gone wrong? Giovanni was dressed in his red robes and biretta. His pale plump face was freshly shaved, smelled of a familiar Florentine cologne. Giulio stood behind him, dark of face and fiercely serious.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, as a former companion under my father's roof, I have the warmest of feelings for you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your Grace, I have always felt that to be so."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is why I want you to become a regular of my household. You must come to dinner, be at my side during my hunting parties, and ride in my train when I cross the city in procession to say mass as Santa Maria in Domenica."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why must I do these things?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I want Rome to know that you are of my intimate circle."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could you not tell Rome that?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Words mean nothing. Churchmen, nobility, wealthy merchants come to this palace. When these people see you here they will know you are under my protection. My father would have wanted it."</p>

  <p class="normal">He blessed Michelangelo, left the room. Michelangelo looked over at Giulio, who stepped forward and spoke with warmth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You know, Buonarroti, Cardinal Giovanni never makes enemies."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That takes genius in Rome today."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Cardinal Giovanni has that genius. He is the most beloved in the College of Cardinals. He feels you need his kindness."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In what way?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bramante blames you for the Ruinante story. Every day he makes new enemies for you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And Cardinal Giovanni wants to fight for me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not by attacking Bramante. If you become an intimate of this house, the cardinal, without saying one angry word to Bramante, will silence your detractors."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo studied Giulio's slender, handsome face; for the first time he felt a liking for Giulio, even as Giulio was manifesting this first friendship toward him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He climbed the winding trail up the Janiculum, then gazed down on the jagged, tawny rooftops of Rome, the Tiber snaking through the city like a continuous S. He asked himself whether he could join the train of Cardinal Giovanni and paint the Sistine ceiling at the same time. He was grateful to Giovanni for wanting to help him; and he needed help. But even if he were not working night and day, how could he become a hanger-on? He simply had no talent for social amenities, nor any liking for society. Hard as he had striven to raise the status of the artist above that of the artisan, he still believed that the artist was a man who had to work all the time. The years were so short, the frustrations so numerous, that unless he labored at the top of his capacity he could never achieve a body of work. How could he paint for a few hours in the morning, go to the baths, walk to Giovanni's house, talk charmingly to thirty guests, eat a delicious dinner over several hours...?</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Giovanni listened carefully to his gratitude and his reasons for being unable to accept.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why is it impossible for you, when Raphael does it so easily? He too turns out considerable work of high quality, yet he has dinner at a different palace each day, supper with intimate friends, goes to the plays, has just bought a gem of a house in Trastevere for his newest mistress. His is a full life, would you not say? New commissions come in every day. He refuses none. Why he, and not you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I honestly don't know the answer, Your Grace. For Raphael, the creating of a work of art is a bright spring day in the <i>campagna; </i>for me, it is the <i>tramontana </i>howling down the valley from the mountaintops. I work from early morning to dark, then by candlelight or oil lamp. Art for me is a torment, grievous when it goes bad, ecstatic when it goes well; but always it possesses me. When I have finished with a day of work I am a husk. Everything that was inside of me is now inside the marble or the fresco. That is why I have nothing to give elsewhere."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not even when it is to your best interest?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"My best interest can only be my best work. Everything else passes."</p>

  <p class="chapter">15.</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to his scaffold determined that nothing should further divert him, neither troubles in Rome nor in Florence. His sketches for the vault were fairly complete now, and they called for three hundred men, women and children, all imbued with the potency of life, displacing space as three-dimensional as those who walked the earth. The force to create them must come from within himself. It would take days, weeks, months of demoniacal energy to imbue each individual character with an authentic anatomy, mind, spirit and soul, an irradiation of strength so monumental and outpouring that few men on the earth below could match them for power. Each one had to be pushed out of his artistic womb, pushed out by his own articulate frenzied force. He must gather within himself his galvanic might; his burgeoning seed must be generated each day anew within his vitals, hurtled into space, projected onto the ceiling, given life everlasting. Though he was creating God the Father, he himself was God the Mother, source of a noble breed, half man, half god, inseminated each night by his own creative fertility, carrying until the dawn, and then, on his lonely truckle bed high in the heavens, going through parturition to deliver a race of immortals.</p>

  <p class="normal">God Almighty creating the sun and the moon, the earth and the water, the plants, the cattle, the crawling things, man and woman, even He had been exhausted from this torrential creativity. "God saw all that He had made, and found it very good." But "On the seventh day, He had come to an end of making, and rested." Why then should he, Michelangelo Buonarroti, a small man, only five feet four, weighing a hundred pounds, no heavier than one of Florence's society girls, laboring for months without adequate food and rest, why should he not be exhausted? When he prayed, "Dear God, help me!" he was praying to himself, beseeching himself to have fortitude, to be invincible of body and spirit, to have the stamina and will to create mightily in a vision of a more heroic world.</p>

  <p class="normal">For thirty days he painted from light to darkness, completing the Sacrifice of Noah, the four titanic male nudes surrounding it, the Erythraean Sibyl on her throne, and the Prophet Isaiah in the pendentive opposite, returning home at night to enlarge the cartoon of the Garden of Eden. For thirty days he slept in his clothes, without taking off even his boots; and when at the completion of the section, utterly spent, he had Michi pull his boots off for him, the skin came away with them.</p>

  <p class="normal">He fed off himself. When he grew dizzy from standing and painting with his head and shoulders thrown back, his neck arched so that he could peer straight upward, his arms aching in every joint from the vertical effort, his eyes blurred from the dripping paint even though he had learned to paint through slits and to blink them shut with each brush stroke as he did against flying marble chips, he had Rosselli make him a still higher platform, the fourth on top of the scaffolding. He painted sitting down, his thighs drawn up tight against his belly for balance, his eyes a few inches from the ceiling, until the unpadded bones of his buttocks became so bruised and sore he could no longer endure the agony. Then he lay flat on his back, his knees in the air, doubled over as tightly as possible against his chest to steady his painting arm. Since he no longer bothered to shave, his beard became an excellent catchall for the constant drip of paint and water. No matter which way he leaned, crouched, lay or knelt, on his feet, knees or back, it was always in strain.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he thought he was going blind. A letter arrived from Buonarroto, and when he tried to read it he could see nothing but a blur. He put the letter down, washed his face, ate a few forkfuls of the overcooked <i>pasta </i>Michi had made for him, went back to the letter. He could not decipher a word.</p>

  <p class="normal">He threw himself on his bed, sorely beset. What was he doing to himself? He had refused to paint the simple commission the Pope had requested, and now he would come out of this chapel a gnarled, twisted, ugly, blind dwarf, deformed and aged by his own colossal stupidity. What Torrigiani had done to his face, the vault would do to his body. He would carry its scars to his dying day. Why couldn't he have let well enough alone? He would have made his peace with the Pope, been back in Florence long since, enjoying dinner with the Company of the Cauldron, living in his comfortable house, carving the Hercules.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sleepless, racked with pain, homesick, lonely, he rose in the inky blackness, lit a candle, and on the back of an old sketch tried to lighten his mood by pouring out his woes:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>I've grown a goitre by dwelling in this den—</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>as cats from stagnant streams in Lombardy,</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>or in what other land they hap to be—</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>which drives the belly close beneath the chin:</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>My beard turns up to heaven; my nape falls in,</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>fixed on my spine: my breast-bone visibly</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>grows like a harp: a rich embroidery</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>bedews my face from brush-drops thick and thin.</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>My loins into my paunch like levers grind:</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>my buttock like a crupper bears my weight;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>my feet unguided wander to and fro;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>In front my skin grows loose and long; behind</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>by bending it becomes more taut and strait;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>crosswise I strain me like a Syrian bow:...</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="block2"><i>Come then, try</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>to succor my dead pictures my fame;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>since foul I fare and painting is my shame.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Word reached him that his brother Lionardo had died in a monastery in Pisa. There was no information as to why he had been moved to Pisa, or whether he had been buried there, or the nature of his illness. But as Michelangelo walked to San Lorenzo in Damaso to have a mass said for the repose of Lionardo's soul, he felt that he knew the answer: his brother had died of an excess of zeal. Might not that also be the cause of his own death?</p>

  <p class="normal">Michi found a colony of stonemasons in Trastevere with whom he spent his evenings and holidays. Rosselli traveled to Naples in the south, Viterbo and Perugia in the north to build his master walls for frescoing. Michelangelo went nowhere. No one came any more to call or to invite him out. His conversations with Michi were confined to the subjects of grinding the colors and material needed on the scaffold. He was living as monastic and secluded a life as the brothers in Santo Spirito.</p>

  <p class="normal">He no longer went to the Papal palace to confer with Julius, though the Pope, after a second visit to the ceiling, had sent him a thousand ducats to carry on the work. No one came to the Sistine. When he walked from his home to the chapel and back he did so almost totally blinded, barely able to stagger across the piazza, his head lowered, seeing no one. Passers-by no longer called attention to his paint- and plaster-stained clothes, face, beard, hair. Some thought him crazy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Crazed would be the better word," he muttered; "after living up in that valhalla of gods and goddesses all day, how do I make the transition back to this mean earth?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not even try. For himself, he had accomplished his primary objective: the life and the people on the ceiling were real. Those living on earth were phantoms. His close friends, his intimates were Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the fourth majestic panel in the line. He portrayed Adam and Eve not as tiny, timid, delicate creatures, but powerfully built, alert, handsome, as primordial as the boulders which sheltered them from the serpent-entwined apple tree, taking temptation in calm accepting strength rather than weak stupidity. Here was a pair to breed the race of man! And when they were banished from the Garden to the barren earth on the opposite side of the panel, with the archangel's sword pointed at their heads, they were frightened, but not cowed, not destroyed, not reduced to crawling things. This was the mother and father of man, created by God, and he, Michelangelo Buonarroti, brought them to life in noble mien and proportion.</p>

  <p class="chapter">16.</p>

  <p class="normal">In June 1510, a year and a few weeks after he had shown Julius the Deluge, the first half of the vault was completed. In a small central panel God in His rose-colored robe had just raised Eve from the rib of the sleeping Adam; in the corners, framing the drama, were four nude sons that would arise from this union, with beautiful faces, powerful bodies carved out of warm flesh-colored marble; directly below on either side were the Vulcanlike Cumaean Sibyl and the Prophet Ezekiel on their thrones beneath the binding cornices. Half of the vault was now a flood of glorious color: mustard yellows, pale sea greens, dust rose and azure blues against the mighty parade of sun-flooded flesh tones.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had not told anyone the vault was half completed, but the Pope knew at once. He sent word to Michelangelo that he would be in the Sistine at midafternoon. Michelangelo helped Julius up the last rungs of the ladder, took him on a tour, pointing out the stories of David and Goliath and Judith and Holophernes, the four stories from the Ancestors of Christ in the side spandrels.</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius demanded that the scaffold be taken down so that the world could see how great a thing was being executed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not yet time to take the scaffold down, Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because there are so many things to be finished: the children playing behind the thrones of the Prophets and Sibyls, the nudes filling either side of the spandrel apexes..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I had heard that the first half was completed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The major panels, yes, but there is so much detail still to be done..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"When will it be ready?" insisted the Pope stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was irritated. He answered shortly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"When it is ready!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius went red in the face, satirized Michelangelo's voice harshly as he cried, "When it is ready! When it is ready!" raised his walking stick in a fury and brought it down across Michelangelo's shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a silence while the two antagonists glared at each other. Michelangelo went cold all over, too shocked to feel pain in the shoulder. He bowed, said formally in a voice from which all emotion had been smitten:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It shall be as Your Holiness desires. The scaffolding will be down by tomorrow, the chapel ready to be shown."</p>

  <p class="normal">He backed away, leaving the space open for the Pope to descend the ladder.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not for you, Buonarroti, to dismiss your pontiff!" cried Julius. "You are dismissed."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo backed down the ladder almost without touching the rungs, left the chapel. So this was the end! A bitter, degrading end, to be beaten with a stick like a <i>villano, </i>peasant. He who had vowed he would raise the status of the artist from that of skilled laborer to the highest reaches of society, whom the Company of the Cauldron had acclaimed when he defied the Pope, he had now been humiliated and degraded as no other reputable artist he had known!</p>

  <p class="normal">Waves of nervous revulsion swept over him as he stumbled and jerked his way blindly along unfamiliar streets. He had re-created the world. He had tried to be God! Well, Pope Julius II had put him in his place. Julius was God's viceroy on earth, even as his brother Lionardo had told him; and he, Michelangelo Buonarroti, was a laborer in the fields. Strange, how one blow of a stick could dispel illusion.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Foul I fare and painting is my shame."</span></i></p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante's triumph was complete.</p>

  <p class="normal">What did he do now? Julius would never forgive him for inciting him to strike the blow, and he would never forgive Julius for inflicting this ignominy on him. He would never pick up a paintbrush, never again touch that vault. Raphael could decorate the other half.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made his way home. Michi was waiting for him, silent and owl-eyed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Pack your things, Michi," he said. "Get a head start on me. We'd better not leave Rome together. If the Pope orders my arrest, I don't want them taking you too."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He had no right to hit you. He's not your father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He's my Holy Father. He can put me to death if he wants to. Only he'll have to catch me first."</p>

  <p class="normal">He filled one canvas bag with his drawings, another with his personal things. It took him only a moment to pen a note to Rosselli, bidding him good-by, and asking him to sell his furniture back to the dealer in Trastevere. Just as he finished there was a knock on the door. He froze. Michi's eyes went to the back door. It was too late for flight. He was caught, before he could get away. What would it be now, what new punishment, humiliation? He smiled grimly. After his fourteen months in the vault, the prison of Sant'Angelo would have its comforts!</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a second sharp knock. He opened the door, expecting to see soldiers. Instead there was Chamberlain Accursio.</p>

  <p class="normal">"May I enter, Messer Buonarroti?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Have you come to arrest me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"My good friend," said Accursio gently, "you must not take these little matters so hard. Do you think the pontiff would bother to strike anyone he was not deeply fond of?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo closed the street door behind Accursio, stood with his palms on the table, staring wide-eyed at the Pope's agent.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you suggesting that the blow was a mark of His Holiness' favor?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope loves you. As a gifted, albeit unruly son." He took a purse from his belt, laid it on the worktable. "The pontiff asked me to bring you these five hundred ducats."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...a golden salve to heal my wound?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...and to convey his apologies."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Holy Father sent apologies to me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. The moment he returned to the palace. He did not want this to happen. He says it's because you both have a <i>terribilità."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"Who knows that the Pope sent you to beg my pardon?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is that important?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Since Rome will know the pontiff struck me, I can only go on living here if people also know that he apologized."</p>

  <p class="normal">Accursio rolled his shoulders, subtly. "Who has ever been able to conceal anything in this city?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius chose the week of the Feast of the Assumption to unveil the first half of the vault. Rosselli directed Mottino and his crew in taking down the scaffold and storing it. Michelangelo spent the intervening weeks at home, drawing and making the cartoons for the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah, the Libyan and Persian Sibyls. He did not go near the Sistine or the Papal palace. Julius sent no word. It was an uneasy truce.</p>

  <p class="normal">He kept no track of time. He knew what season he was in, and sometimes the month, but little more. When he wrote home he could not date his letters, saying, "I know not what day it is, but I think yesterday was Friday," or "I do not know what the date is today, but I know that yesterday was St. Luke's Feast Day." The Pope did not order him to the chapel for the ceremonies. The first he knew of the gathering in the Sistine was when Michi answered a knock at midday, bringing Raphael into the workroom. Michelangelo was crouched over his table sketching Haman and the Brazen Serpent for the spandrels.</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked up at Raphael, saw that the younger man's face had aged considerably, with dark circles under his eyes, the flesh a little flaccid. He was dressed in expensive mauve satin embroidered with costly jewels. Commissions flooding into his <i>bottega </i>included everything from designing a dagger to building great palaces; his assistants completed whatever Raphael had no further time for. Only twenty-seven, he looked ten years older. Even as Michelangelo's hard, grueling labor had taken its toll of him, so Raphael's fine looks were dissolving in his too-muchness of everything: food, drink, women, pleasure, company, praise.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Messer Buonarroti, your chapel staggers me," said Raphael with admiration in his voice and eyes. "I came to apologize for my bad manners. I should never have spoken to you as I did in the piazza. You deserved better of me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo remembered going to Leonardo da Vinci to apologize for his own bad manners.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Artists must forgive each other their sins."</p>

  <p class="normal">No one else came to congratulate him, no one stopped him on the street, no one approached him with a new commission. He was as solitary as though he were dead. The painting on the ceiling of the Sistine was outside the pale of Rome's life, a private duel between Michelangelo, God and Julius II.</p>

  <p class="normal">And, suddenly, Pope Julius was deep in war.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two days after the unveiling, Julius left Rome at the head of his army to drive the French out of northern Italy and to solidify the Papal State. Michelangelo watched him leave, riding a fiery charger, followed in procession by Spanish troops provided by the King of Spain to whom he had given control of Naples; Italian mercenaries under his nephew, the Duke of Urbino; and Roman columns led by his nephew-in-law, Marcantonio Colonna. His first objective was to besiege Ferrara, ally of the French. To help him in his conquest he was to have fifteen thousand Swiss troops, bolstered by the considerable Venetian forces. On the way north there were independent city-states to be reduced: Modena, Mirandola, family seat of the magnificent Pico.....</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo worried; the French were the sole protection of the Republic of Florence. If Julius could drive the French troops out of Italy, Florence would be vulnerable. It would be Gonfaloniere Soderini's and the Signoria's turn to feel the papal stick across their backs. He had also been left stranded; or he had stranded himself. The Pope's chamberlain had brought him money and an apology, but he had not brought him specific permission to put back the scaffolding and commence work on the altar half of the vault. Julius had waited for him to appear at the Vatican. He had waited for Julius to summon him. The Pope could be gone for months. What did he do in the meanwhile?</p>

  <p class="normal">A letter from his father informed him that his brother Buonarroto was seriously ill. He would have liked to make the trip to Florence to be at his side, but did he dare to leave Rome? He sent money instead, out of Julius' apology purse. He considered seeking a commission, anything in marble or paint that would occupy and support him until the Pope's return. But he had never sought a commission. He did not know how to go about it.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he heard that the Papal Datary, a Florentine by the name of Lorenzo Pucci, was leaving to join the Pope in Bologna, he sought him out and asked if he would speak to Julius in his behalf, try to collect the five hundred ducats still owed him for the half of the vault he had completed, secure permission to begin the second half, money to erect the scaffold. The Datary said he would try; He would also see if he could find an outside commission for Michelangelo to tide him over.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Michelangelo sat down to write a sonnet to the Pope:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>I am thy drudge and have been from my youth—</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Thine, like the rays which the sun's circle fill.</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Yet of my dear time's waste thou thinkst no ill.</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>The more I toil, the less I move thy ruth.</i></p>

  <p class="chapter">17.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not until after New Year's, 1511, that he was able to start painting again. During the intervening months he had added to his fund of aggravation and frustration. Unable to stand the inactivity any longer, he had followed the Pope to Bologna, only to find the Bentivoglios regaining power, Pope Julius too immersed in his troubles to see him. He had gone on to Florence to visit Buonarroto, resolved to take some of his past savings which had been deposited for safekeeping with the <i>spedalingo, </i>business manager of the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova, rebuild his scaffold and return to work without permission or the Pope's money. He found Buonarroto recovered, but too weak to work; and that his father had received the first political appointment tended by Florence to a Buonarroti in Michelangelo's lifetime: as <i>podestà </i>in the village of San Casciano. Lodovico had taken with him some of the savings from the <i>spedalingo </i>without Michelangelo's knowledge or consent, money to which he no longer had a legal right. An apologetic letter from his father explained:</p>

  <p class="versi">I took them with the hope that I should be able to put them back before your return to Florence. Now I see that I did wrong. I am awfully sorry. I did wrong in following other people's advices.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had returned to Rome empty-handed. And it seemed that Pope Julius too would return empty-handed. For Julius, the general, everything had gone wrong: though his troops had taken Modena, he had found Bologna meagerly garrisoned and low on food supplies, with the Bentivoglios at one gate, the French army entrenched a few miles away. Ferrara had driven off his army in a serious defeat; the Swiss troops had been bribed by the French to return home; he was ready to send Pico della Mirandola's nephew to negotiate his surrender to the French when the Venetian and Spanish troops finally arrived to save him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the Datary returned with the money owed Michelangelo, permission to place his scaffold under the second half of the chapel, across to the Pope's throne at the end, and the money to pay for it. Now Michelangelo could come to grips with God: God Creating Adam, Creating the Sun and Moon, Dividing the Waters from the Earth, Separating Light and Darkness; strive to visualize a God of such transcendence that everyone would cry out, "Yes! That is the Lord God! None other could be!" These four panels were the heart of the vault. Everything depended upon them. Unless he could create God as convincingly as God had created man, his ceiling would lack the focal core from whence sprang its reason for being.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had always loved God. In his darkest hours he cried out, "God did not create us to abandon us." His faith in God sustained him; and now he must make manifest to the world who God was, what He looked and felt like, wherein lay His divine power and grace. His God must not be special or peculiar or particular, but God the Father to all men, one whom they could accept, honor, adore.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a delicate task, yet he did not doubt that he could achieve such a God. He had only to set down in drawings the image he had carried with him since childhood. God as the most beautiful, powerful, intelligent and loving force in the universe. Since He had created man in His own image, He had the face and body of a man. The first human whom God created, Adam, had surely been fashioned in His likeness. By setting forth Adam, the son, true creature of his Father: magnificent in body, noble in thought, tender in spirit, beautiful of face and limb, archetype of all that was the finest in heaven and on earth, there would be reflected God, the Father. God, in clinging white robe which matched His virile white beard, had only to hold out His right arm to Adam, to reach one infinitesimal life-breath more, man and the world would begin.</p>

  <p class="normal">While Michelangelo remained high in the heavens painting the smaller panel of God Dividing the Waters from the Earth, Julius reversed positions with his fresco painter, plunging into the special inferno reserved for warriors who suffer a rout. He failed in his siege of Ferrara, failed in his efforts to break the alliance between the Holy Roman Empire and France; went down so badly with gout that he had to be carried to Ravenna in an oxcart His papal and Venetian forces were severely defeated by the rampaging Ferrarese, his funds so exhausted that he had to raise eighty thousand ducats by selling eight new cardinalates at ten thousand ducats each. The French and Ferrarese recaptured Bologna and reinstated the Bentivoglios. Julius lost his armies, artillery, baggage, the last of his resources. Crushed, making his way back to Rome, he found nailed to the cathedral door at Rimini a summons of all rebellious churchmen to a General Council at Pisa to conduct an inquiry into the official behavior of Pope Julius II.</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius' defeat was a defeat for Michelangelo, for his life had become inextricably interwoven with his pontiff's. The moment the Bentivoglios returned to power, the Bolognese had thronged into the Piazza Maggiore, torn his bronze statue of Julius from its niche, and thrown it to the paving stones. The triumphant Duke of Ferrara had then melted it down and recast it into a cannon, which he named <i>Julius. </i>Fifteen months of his time, energy, talent and suffering now sat on the cobbles of the Piazza Maggiore in the form of a cannon that was the butt of coarse jokes from the Bolognese, and would surely be used against Pope Julius if he were rash enough to lead another army northward. Vincenzo had triumphed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Here in Rome, it seemed to Michelangelo, the same pattern of overthrow must inevitably continue. During the warm, light days of May and June he spent seventeen consecutive hours on the scaffold, taking food and a chamber pot up with him so that he would not have to descend, painting like a man possessed, the four glorious nude males in the corners of the panels, then the young Prophet Daniel with an enormous book on his lap; opposite, the old Persian Sibyl in her white and rose robes, then the single most powerful portrait on the ceiling, God in deeply dramatic action, creating the golden ball of the sun... hoping, praying, striving desperately to complete his Genesis before the collapse of its protector, before outraged successors came in, clerical or military and, wanting to wipe out all traces of Pope Julius II's reign, sent a crew into the Sistine to spread coats of whitewash over its ceiling.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a race against death. As a result of his internecine warfare, Julius had returned to Rome the most hated man in Italy, his resources so exhausted that he had to carry the papal tiara to the banker Chigi's house under his robes, ostensibly going to dinner, but actually to borrow forty thousand ducats on the jewels. His enmities extended to all the city-states he had defeated and punished: Venice, Bologna, Modena, Perugia, Mirandola.... Even the Roman nobles, some of whom had led his defeated armies, were now in league against him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bound to each other, understanding defeat, Michelangelo felt that he must call on his Pope, the only obligation that could take him off the scaffold.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, I have come to pay my respects."</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius' face was ravaged by frustration and illness. Their last face-to-face encounter had been a stormy one, yet instinctively Julius sensed that Michelangelo had not come seeking revenge. Julius' voice was friendly, intimate; they felt strongly drawn to each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your ceiling, it moves along?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, I think you will be gratified."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If I am, you will be the first to bring me gratification for a long time."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is no simpler in art than in war, Holiness," said Michelangelo firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will come to the Sistine with you. This very moment."</p>

  <p class="normal">He could hardly make it up the ladder. Michelangelo had to haul him the last few rungs. He stood panting at the top; and then he saw God above him, about to impart the gift of life to Adam. A smile came to his cracked lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you truly believe that God is that benign?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I most ardently hope so, since I am going to be standing before Him before long. If He is as you have painted Him, then I shall be forgiven my sins." He turned his face toward Michelangelo, his expression radiant "I am pleased with you, my son."</p>

  <p class="normal">Basking in the rays of the hot sun and the Pope's hearty acceptance of his labors, Michelangelo was reluctant to relinquish the happy mood. Wanting to hold its warmth and tranquillity for a little while longer, he crossed the piazza to where the piers and walls of the new St. Peter's were beginning to rise. As he got closer he was surprised to find that Bramante was not building in the traditional manner for cathedrals, of solid stone and concrete, but was erecting hollow concrete forms and filling them with rubble from the Old Basilica, and other debris. The bulky mass would give the appearance of being solid, but was it not a dangerous way to support so heavy a structure?</p>

  <p class="normal">This was only the beginning of his astonishment. As he circled the works and watched the men preparing the concrete, he saw that they were not following the sound engineering precept of one portion of cement to three or four of sand, but were using ten and twelve portions of sand to each one of cement. There was no question in his mind that this mix could be fatal under the best of circumstances, but to hold the vast St. Peter's with uncompacted debris between its piers, it could be catastrophic.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made straight for Bramante's palace, was admitted by a liveried footman into the elegance of the foyer, with its rich Persian carpets, priceless tapestries and furniture. He had not been invited, but the message he had to deliver was urgent. Bramante was working in his library, clad in a silk robe with gold clasps at the throat and waist</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bramante, I will pay you the compliment of believing that you do not know what is going on," he began without preamble or salutation. "However, when the walls of St. Peter's crumble, it will make little difference whether you were stupid or merely negligent. Your walls will crack."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante was annoyed at the visit.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who are you, a ceiling decorator, to tell the greatest architect in Europe how to build piers?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The same one who showed you how to build a scaffold. Someone is cheating you."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Davvero? </span></i><span>It is true? How?"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"By putting in the mix considerably less cement than the minimum requirements."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, you're an engineer!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo ignored the remark.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bramante, watch your foreman prepare the cement. Somebody is taking advantage..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante went purple with rage, his bull-like shoulders hunched up around his jowls.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Whom else have you told this to?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No one. I hurried here to warn you...."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante rose, clenched both fists in front of his jaw.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, if you run to the Pope with this scandal-mongering I swear I'll strangle you with my bare hands. You're nothing but an incompetent troublemaking... Florentine!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He spat out the last word as though it were a deadly insult. Michelangelo remained calm.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall watch your cement mix for two days. At the end of that time, if you are not using safe proportions, I shall report it to the Pope and to everyone else who will listen to me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No one will listen to you. You command no respect in Rome. Now get out of my house."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante did nothing to change his materials. Michelangelo sweated out the paint from his pores in the Piazza Scossacavalli baths, put on his brown shirt and <i>calze, </i>went to the Papal palace. Julius listened for a time, then interrupted. His voice was impatient, though not unkind.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My son, you should not bother yourself with other people's affairs. Bramante has already warned me of your attack on him. I don't know the cause of your enmity, but it is unworthy of you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, I genuinely fear for the structure. The new St. Peter's grew out of Sangallo's idea for a separate chapel for Your Holiness' tomb. I feel responsible."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, are you an architect?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To the extent that every good sculptor is an architect."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But you are not as good an architect, or as experienced, as Bramante?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is he interfering in the way you are painting the Sistine?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, he is not."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then why can't you be content to paint your ceiling and let Bramante build his church?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"If Your Holiness would appoint a commission to investigate... I came out of a sense of loyalty."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know that, my son," replied Julius. "But St. Peter's is going to take many years to build. If you come running here in hot blood every time you see something you don't like..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo knelt abruptly, kissed the Pope's ring, left. The Pope was right. Why could he not mind his own business? Yet he could not be neutral about St. Peter's. It had been the cause of unseating his friend Sangallo, had given Bramante the ascendancy in the Pope's mind which led to the cancellation of the tomb marbles, to his being locked out of the Papal palace, to the months of irresolution in Florence, the more than a year of wasted work in Bologna, and now more years of servitude in the vault.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was also sorely puzzled. Bramante was too good an architect to put his most important creation in danger. There must be an explanation. Leo Baglioni knew everything; he knocked on his door.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's not hard to explain," replied Leo casually. "Bramante is living beyond his means, spending hundreds of thousands of ducats. He has to have more money... from any source. Right now the piers of St. Peter's are paying his debts."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aghast, Michelangelo cried, "Have you told the Pope this?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Assuredly not."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But how can you be silent in such a matter?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You told the Pope the facts. What did it get you, besides an admonition to mind your own business?"</p>

  <p class="chapter">18.</p>

  <p class="normal">In August, while Michelangelo was beginning his panel of the Creation of Eve, Julius went hunting at Ostia, returning home with malaria. He was reported to be at the point of death. The rooms of his private apartment were sacked, down to its linens; the Roman nobles organized to "evict the barbarian from Rome"; from all over Italy the hierarchy hurried to Rome to select a new Pope. The city buzzed with gossip. Would Cardinal Riario at long last have his turn, and Leo Baglioni become the Pope's confidential agent? Meanwhile the French and Spanish hovered on the borders, hoping to conquer Italy during the confusion. Michelangelo became anxious. If Pope Julius died, what happened to his payment for the second half of the Sistine? He had only an oral agreement with Julius, not a written contract which his heirs would have to honor.</p>

  <p class="normal">The only calm area in Italy seemed to be Florence, thanks to the genius of Gonfaloniere Soderini, who had kept his city-state out of the quarrels, alliances, wars, resolutely holding to the middle ground, offering refuge to both the papal and French soldiers, refusing to house the Pisa Council of protest over Julius, but not attempting to keep it out of Pisa by force. Michelangelo knew that that was where he should be right now, and forever, out of this capital of chaos.</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius fooled Rome: he recovered. The nobles fled. The Pope took firm control of the Vatican, money started coming in, he paid Michelangelo another five hundred ducats. Michelangelo sent a modest sum home, but the greater part of the payment he kept in Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm flattered!" cried Balducci when Michelangelo brought in the money. Balducci, grown portly with good and quiet living, had already sired four children. "Didn't you always believe that a dishonest Florentine bank was safer than an honest Roman one?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Balducci, I could have saved myself endless aggravation if you had been in charge of my affairs from the beginning. But artists are endlessly inventive in their ways of being stupid about money."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now that you're independently wealthy," teased Balducci with his perennial good humor, "won't you come to dinner on Sunday? We entertain all our biggest depositors."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thanks, Balducci, but I'll wait until I'm a part owner."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Michelangelo made a second sizable deposit, and again refused Balducci's invitation, the banker walked over to Michelangelo's house late of a Sunday afternoon, bringing a cake his cook had baked. He had not been in the house in two years; he was shocked at its shabby meanness.</p>

  <p class="normal">"For heaven's sake, Michelangelo, how can you live like this?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't help it, Balducci. I keep hiring apprentices who swear they want to learn and will take care of the house, but they're lazy and incompetent."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then hire a servant, one who knows how to cook and clean, who can give you a few of the amenities of life."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What would I do with a servant? I'm never here; I don't come home at midday for dinner..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What would you do with a trained servant? You would live in a clean house, eat decent food; come home at night to a tub of hot water for your bath, have freshly washed linens laid out for you, a bottle of wine properly cooled..."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Piano, piano, </span></i><span>Balducci, softly, softly, you talk as though I were a rich man."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"You're stingy, not poor! You earn enough to live well. Not like a... a... You are destroying your health. What good will it do you to be a rich man in Florence if you kill yourself in Rome?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I won't kill myself. I am of stone."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Isn't your life hard enough, up on that scaffold, without making it worse by penury?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo flinched.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know you're right, Balducci. I must have some of my father in me. But right now I have no patience to live well. As long as I'm on that vault, there's nothing I can salvage in terms of pleasure or comfort. The time to live well is when one is happy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"When will that be?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"As soon as I get back to marble."</p>

  <p class="normal">He pushed rigorously into the autumn, painting Sundays and religious holidays. A young orphan apprentice by the name of Andrea came to help each afternoon, and to take care of his house. Michelangelo let him paint a few decorative rams' heads and doorframes, flat walls or floor surfaces that Bugiardini had done at Santa Maria Novella. He allowed Michi to fill in some of the exposed surfaces of the thrones and cornices. Young Silvio Falconi, who asked to be considered as an apprentice, and who had a talent for drawing, he permitted to do a few of the color decorations buried in the end spandrels. All the rest, the entire reach of the vault, he painted himself: every figure, every robe, every face, every limb of every nude, every expression, emotion, every <i>putto, </i>every child behind the Prophets and Sibyls, the exquisitely beautiful Sibyls, the powerful and glorious Hebrew Prophets, every last touch he did himself: a gigantic lifetime of labor jammed into three apocalyptic years.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was new trouble abroad. Pope Julius, strong again, turned against Gonfaloniere Soderini, put an interdict on the Republic of Florence for not siding with him, for not providing troops and money when he had been in trouble, for giving refuge to enemy troops, for not crushing the Council at Pisa. Julius appointed Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici as papal legate at Bologna, with an eye to bringing Tuscany under the rule of the Vatican.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was invited to the Medici palace at the end of the Via Ripetta. Cardinal Giovanni, Cousin Giulio and Giuliano were gathered in the drawing room.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have heard that the Holy Father has appointed me papal legate to Bologna, with authority to raise an army."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Like Piero's?"</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a strained silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I hope not," replied Cardinal Giovanni. "Everything will be peaceable. We want only to be Florentines again, to have our palace and banks and lands back."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Soderini must go!" interjected Giulio.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is that part of the plan, Your Grace?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. Pope Julius is outraged at Florence, and determined to conquer it. If Soderini goes, a few irreconcilables on the Signoria..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who is to rule Florence in Soderini's place?" He tried to keep down his rising emotion.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Giuliano."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked across the room to Giuliano, saw the color mount in his cheeks. The choice seemed a stroke of genius: for Giuliano, now thirty-two, tall, with a slight beard and mustache, said to have weak lungs, yet to Michelangelo's glance seeming robust, Giuliano was close to <i>Il Magnifico </i>in mind, spirit and temperament. He had put in years of disciplined study, tried to prepare himself in the image of his father. He was handsomer than Lorenzo, though his nose was long and flat, his large eyes heavy-lidded, and had inherited most of Lorenzo's finest qualities: a gentle soul, with a touch of wisdom in him, and no violence. He had a reverence for art and learning, a deep love for Florence, its people and traditions. If Florence had to have a ruler, over and beyond its elected Gonfaloniere, Lorenzo's youngest and most gifted son seemed perfect for the job.</p>

  <p class="normal">The men in the room knew Michelangelo's affection for Giuliano. They did not know that a fifth person was present, standing in his robes of office in the center of the floor, his long homely face, wobbly nose, bland eyes and yellow-streaked white hair all corporeally present for Michelangelo: Piero Soderini, elected lifetime Gonfaloniere of the Republic of Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">Looking down at his cracked and paint-stained nails, Michelangelo asked, "Why have you told me this?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because we want you on our side," replied Cardinal Giovanni. "You belong with the Medici. Should we need you..."</p>

  <p class="normal">He threaded his way as through the eye of a needle to the Piazza Navona, took a series of right angles to the Piazza Venezia, then went down the street of the ancient Roman forums with their scattered columns standing upright, and entered the colosseum, brightly lit in the full moonlight, for a thousand years Rome's quarry for home builders needing hand-hewn stone. He climbed to the topmost tier, sat on the parapet of the gallery overlooking the vast theater from its lowest, darkest pits with its cells where Christians, warriors, slaves, animals had been herded, up to its top sections of stone seats where the multitudes of the Roman Empire had sat, screaming for battle and blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">...battle and blood, blood and battle: The phrase kept going through his mind. It seemed to be all that Italy was to know. All that he had known in his lifetime. At this very moment Julius was gathering another army to march north. If Florence resisted, the Pope would send Giovanni's troops against its walls. If Florence did not resist, Gonfaloniere Soderini would be driven out, as would all the members of the Signoria who did not consent to the loss of their independence. Now he too was being asked to become a part of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">He loved both Gonfaloniere Soderini and Giuliano de' Medici. He felt a strong loyalty to <i>Il Magnifico, </i>to Contessina, yes, to Cardinal Giovanni too. But he had a faith in the Republic, which had given him his first recognition. To whom was he to be unfaithful, ungrateful? Granacci would tell him, "If anyone asks what side you're on, answer 'On the side of sculpture.' Be courageous in art, and a coward in the world of affairs."</p>

  <p class="normal">Could he be?</p>

  <p class="chapter">19.</p>

  <p class="normal">During the gray winter months of 1512, while he painted the lunettes over the tall windows, his eyes became so badly afflicted that he could not read a line unless he threw his head back sharply and held the letter or book high in the air above him. Though Julius had remained in Rome, his wars had started. His armies were commanded by the Spaniard, Cardona of Naples. Cardinal Giovanni left for Bologna, but twice the Bolognese, bolstered by the French, fought off the Pope's troops. Cardinal Giovanni never got into Bologna. The French then chased the Pope's army into Ravenna where, on Easter, the decisive battle was fought; ten to twelve thousand soldiers of the papal troops were reported to have died in the field. Cardinal Giovanni and Cousin Giulio were taken prisoner. The Romagna fell into French hands. Rome was in panic. The Pope took refuge in the fortress of Sant'Angelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo went on painting his vault.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the tide of fortune turned: the winning French commander was killed. The French fought among themselves. The Swiss came into Lombardy to fight the French. Cardinal Giovanni, having saved Giulio by a ruse, himself escaped and returned to Rome. The Pope returned to the Vatican. During the summer Julius recovered Bologna. The French were driven out of the country. The Spanish general Cardona, an ally of the Medici, sacked Prato, just a few miles from Florence. Gonfaloniere Soderini was forced to resign, fleeing with his family. Giuliano entered Florence as a private citizen. Behind him came Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici with Cardona's army, returning to his old palace in the quarter of Sant'Antonio near the Faenza gate. The Signoria resigned. A Council of Forty-five was appointed by Cardinal Giovanni, a new constitution adopted. The Republic had come to an end.</p>

  <p class="normal">During all these months the Pope kept insisting that Michelangelo complete his ceiling quickly, quickly! Then one day Julius climbed the ladder unannounced.</p>

  <p class="normal">"When will it be finished?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"When I have satisfied myself."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Satisfied yourself in what? You have already taken four full years."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the matter of art, Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is my pleasure that you finish it in a matter of days."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It will be done, Holy Father, when it will be done."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you want to be thrown down from this scaffolding?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gazed at the marble floor below.</p>

  <p class="normal">"On All Saints' Day I shall celebrate mass here," declared the Pope. "It will be two years since I blessed the first half."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had wanted to touch up some of the draperies and skies <i>a secco, </i>in gold and ultramarines, as his Florentine predecessors had done below him. But there would be no time now. He had Michi and Mottino take down the scaffold. The next day Julius stopped by.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't some of the decorations need to be brightened with gold?" he demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Useless to explain that he had wanted to do this. Nor was he going to re-erect the scaffold and go back up into the vault.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, in those times men did not bedeck themselves with gold."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It will look poor!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo planted his feet stubbornly beneath him, his teeth locked, his chin stiffened. Julius gripped his fist over his walking stick. The two men stood before the altar beneath the heavens and glared at each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Those whom I have painted were poor," said Michelangelo, breaking the silence. "They were holy men."</p>

  <p class="normal">On All Saints' Day official Rome dressed itself in its finest robes for the Pope's dedication of the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo rose early, went to the baths, shaved off his beard, donned his blue hose, blue wool shirt.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he did not go to the Sistine. Instead he walked out under the portico of his house, pulled back the tarpaulin, stood ruminatively before the marble columns he had waited these seven long years to carve. He walked to his work desk, picked up a pen, wrote:</p>

  <p class="versi">The best of artists hath no thought to show</p>

  <p class="versi">Which the rough stone in its superfluous shell</p>

  <p class="versi">Doth not include; to break the marble spell</p>

  <p class="versi">Is all the hand that serves the brain can do.</p>

  <p class="normal">Standing on the threshold of his hard-earned freedom, disregarding his costly hose, the fine wool shirt, he took up his hammer and chisel. Fatigue, memory, bitterness and pain fell away. Sunlight streaming in the window caught the first shafts of marble dust that floated upward.</p>
