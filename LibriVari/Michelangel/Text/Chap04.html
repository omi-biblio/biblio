  <h1>BOOK FOUR:<br/>The Flight</h1>

  <p class="normal">He shared his former bed with Buonarroto. Under it he put his two marble reliefs, wrapped in soft wool cloth. Lorenzo had said that the sculptures were his. Assuredly, he thought with a wry smile, Piero would not want them. After two years of having a comfortable apartment and freedom of movement in the palace, it was not easy for him to live in this small room with his three brothers.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why can't you go back and work for Piero de' Medici?" his father asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I would not be wanted."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But Piero never said in plain words that he didn't want you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Piero has only fancy words."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico ran both hands through his luxuriant hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You can't afford pride. You haven't the price in your purse."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo replied humbly, "Pride is all I have left at the moment, Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">Out of kindness, Lodovico desisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">This three months was the longest stretch he could remember having gone without drawing. The idleness made him cranky. Lodovico too was upset, the more so because Giovansimone, now thirteen, was in trouble with the Signoria because of acts of vandalism. When the heat of July came on and Michelangelo was still too distracted to work, Lodovico lost patience.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The last thing I thought I would say about you, Michelagnolo, was that you were lazy. I can't allow you to mope around the house any longer. I've asked your uncle Francesco to get you into the Money Changers Guild. You had two years of education with those professors in the palace..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo smiled ruefully as he thought of the Plato Four sitting around the low table in the <i>studiolo </i>analyzing the Hebraic sources of Christianity.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nothing that would help me turn a profit."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...and someday you'll form a partnership with Buonarroto. He is going to be a shrewd businessman. You will prosper."</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked upstream along the Arno to a willow-covered bank where he submerged his hot body in the muddy waters. When his head cooled, he asked himself, "What are my alternatives?" He could go to live and work with the Topolinos. He had walked up the hills several times and sat in silence in the yard, hewing building stone; it was a relief, but not a solution. Should he seek out a sculpture commission by going from palace to palace, church to church, Tuscan village to village like an itinerant knife grinder, singing out, "Any marble to carve today?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Unlike the Plato Four, he had not been given a villa and the resources to continue his work. Lorenzo had asked Lodovico, "Will you cede him?" yet had not made him a member of the family. Lorenzo had in effect commissioned him to do a whole fa√ßade for the unfinished front of the Medici church, with twenty marble statues, but had made no provision for the work.</p>

  <p class="normal">He put his shut on over his wet body, as tawny now as a Maiano quarryman's from his nights along the river. When he reached home he found Granacci waiting for him. Granacci had returned to Ghirlandaio's <i>bottega </i>with Bugiardini a few days after Lorenzo's funeral.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Salve, </span></i><span>Granacci. How go things at Ghirlandaio's?"</span></p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Salve, </span></i><span>Michelangelo. Quite good. Two panels for the abbey of San Giusto at Volterra, the Salutation for the church of Castello. Ghirlandaio wants to see you."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The studio smelled as he remembered it: of fresh ground charcoal, paint pigments in chemists' sacks, bags of fresh plaster. Bugiardini embraced him joyfully. Tedesco pounded him on the shoulder. Cieco and Baldinelli got off their stools to ask the news. Mainardi kissed him affectionately on both cheeks. David and Benedetto shook his hand. Domenico Ghirlandaio sat at his fastidious desk at the rear of the studio observing the scene with a warm smile. Michelangelo gazed up at his first master, thinking how much had happened in the four years since he had first stood here.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not finish out your apprenticeship?" asked Ghirlandaio. "I'll double the contract money. If you need more later, we can discuss it as friends."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood numb.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have much work on hand, as you can see. And don't tell me again that fresco is not for you. If you can't paint the wet wall, you certainly will be valuable in working up the figures and cartoons."</p>

  <p class="normal">He left the studio, walked into the Piazza della Signoria and stood in the burning sun gazing sightlessly at the statues in the loggia. The offer was timely, it would get him out of the house during the day, the offer of double pay would placate Lodovico. He had been lonely since the garden broke up. The studio would give him companionship. It would also put him under a professional roof again, and at seventeen that was proper. He had no incentive to work, but Ghirlandaio would plunge him into a cauldron of activity and assignments. Perhaps this would shake him out of his lethargy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Unmindful of the intense heat, he took the road up to Settignano, trudged through the ripe wheat fields, cooled himself in the slow-running creek at the bottom. Refreshed, he continued on to the Topolinos', took a seat under the arches and began chipping stone.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stayed for several days, working steadily, sleeping in the open with the boys on straw mattresses spread under the arches. The Topolinos knew he was troubled. They asked no questions and proffered no advice. He would have to pound out his answer for himself. His hands groped open and shut for the hammer and chisel; he felt the familiar solidity of them grasped in his clenched palms and fingers; felt the rhythmical movements of his wrist and arm and shoulder as he chipped away, bringing outline and form to the <i>pietra serena. </i>Strange how his heart could stand empty because his hands were empty.</p>

  <p class="normal">In Settignano it was said, "Who works stone must share its nature: rough on the outside, serene within."</p>

  <p class="normal">As he worked the stone he worked his thoughts: one two three four five six seven for work and no thought; one two three four during the rest to formulate a fragment. Here he could achieve emotional tranquillity and clarity; here his inner strength could resolve itself. As the stones took shape under his hands, so his thoughts matured in his mind; and he knew that he could not go back to Ghirlandaio's. For that was what it would be, a going backward: to an art and a trade that he had never wanted, and had taken only because there was no sculpture studio in Florence. The demands of the frescoes would change his drawing and design and he would lose all that he had learned of sculpture over the past three years. It would be a continuous contest, unfair to Ghirlandaio. It simply would not work. He had to move forward even if he could not see where or how.</p>

  <p class="normal">He bade the Topolinos good-by, walked down the hill to the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the Via de' Bardi he met bespectacled Father Nicola Bichiellini, tall, solidly built prior of the Order of Hermits of Santo Spirito. The prior had grown up in Michelangelo's neighborhood, the best football player on the broad earthen square before Santa Croce. At fifty his close-cropped black hair was shot with gray, but his body under the black woolen tunic and leather belt was still so charged with vitality that he welcomed each twenty-four-hour workday in which he governed his self-sustaining monastery-village of church, hospital, guesthouse, bakehouse, library, school and four hundred silent monks.</p>

  <p class="normal">He greeted Michelangelo heartily, his sparkling blue eyes enormous behind the magnifying lenses.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo Buonarroti, what pleasure! I have not seen you since Lorenzo's funeral."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I guess I haven't seen anybody, Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can remember you drawing in Santo Spirito before you ever went into the Medici garden. You stayed away from Master Urbino's school to copy those frescoes of Fiorentini's. Did you know that Urbino complained to me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo began to feel warm inside himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How flattering that you should remember, Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly there came into his mind the picture of the beautifully bound volumes and manuscripts in Lorenzo's <i>studiolo </i>and library, books from which he had now locked himself out.</p>

  <p class="normal">"May I read in your library, Father? I no longer have access to books."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But of course. Ours is a public library. If you will forgive me the sin of bragging, it is also the oldest library in Florence. Boccaccio willed us his manuscripts and books. And Petrarch as well. Drop into my office."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt happy for the first time in months.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, Father. I'll bring my sketching materials."</p>

  <p class="normal">Early the next morning he crossed Ponte Santa Trinita to the church of Santo Spirito. He copied for a while before a fresco of Filippino Lippi and a sarcophagus of Bernardo Rossellino. It was the first work he had done since Lorenzo's death. He felt his vitality rise, his breathing become deep and natural without the obstacle of unhappiness breaking its rhythm.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he walked at an angle across the square to the monastery which occupied the entire area behind Piazza Santo Spirito. Here the prior had his office. He had to meet the world, and his door was open to all; but the rest of the monastery maintained complete seclusion. No one was allowed into the monastery itself; the monks were confined to the specific paths of their duties. Prior Bichiellini looked at his drawings, exclaimed, "Good! Good! You know, Michelangelo, we have much older and better works inside the monastery. Frescoes by the Gaddi family in the Cloister of the Masters. Our chapter house walls have fine scenes by Simone Martini..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's amber eyes sparkled with the magnified intensity of the prior's behind his spectacles.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But no one is allowed inside..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We can arrange it. I'll draw up a schedule for you when there will be no one in the cloisters or chapter house. I've long felt these art works should be used by other artists. But it was the library you wanted. Come along."</p>

  <p class="normal">Prior Bichiellini led the way to the library rooms. Here half a dozen Florentine laymen were studying from ancient tomes, while in the alcoves specially trained monks were making copies of valuable volumes that had been loaned to Santo Spirito from all over Europe. The prior led Michelangelo to the full sets of Plato, Aristotle, the Greek poets and dramatists, the Roman historians. He explained in an academic tone, "We are a school. We have no censors here in Santo Spirito. There are no forbidden books. We insist that our students remain free to think, inquire, doubt. We do not fear that Catholicism will suffer from our liberality; our religion is strengthened as the minds of our students grow mature."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Shades of Fra Savonarola," said Michelangelo ironically.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior's hearty, warm-cheeked face went dark at the mention of Savonarola's name.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will want to see Boccaccio's manuscripts. They are fascinating. Most people think he was an enemy of the Church. On the contrary, he loved the Church. He hated its abuses, as did St. Augustine. We eat frugally, own nothing but the habit on our backs, and our vows of chastity are as precious to us as our love of God."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know that, Father. Santo Spirito is the most respected order in Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And could we be respected if we were afraid of learning? We believe that the human brain is one of God's most magnificent creations. We also believe that art is religious, because it is one of man's highest aspirations. There is no such thing as pagan art, only good and bad art." He paused for a moment to look about with pride at his library. "Come back to the office when you have finished reading. My secretary will draw a map of the buildings for you, and a schedule of hours when you may work in each cloister."</p>

  <p class="normal">In the weeks that followed he saw no one whose daily work route did not carry him through the Cloister of the Dead, or through the Second Cloister with its three generations of Gaddi frescoes, or the chapter house where the Sienese painter, Martini, had done the Passion of Christ. The occasional monk or lay brother who passed gave no indication that he was there. The silence he found annealing, as though he were alone in the universe: just he, his drawing materials, the tombs he was copying, or the Cimabue frescoes under the arches. When he was not copying he spent his time in the library reading: Ovid, Homer, Horace, Virgil.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior was pleased that he was using all the hours vouchsafed him by the schedule. He would discuss with him the developments of the day. Michelangelo never had had much interest in politics. Under the hand of Lorenzo the domestic government worked so smoothly and the international alliances were so strong that there were few strictly political discussions in the palace, the streets, Ghirlandaio's, on the Duomo steps. Now he desperately needed someone to talk to; the prior, sensing the need, gave freely of his time.</p>

  <p class="normal">With Lorenzo's death everything had changed. Where Lorenzo had met continually with his Signoria, gaining their agreement through the powers of persuasion, Piero ignored the elected Councils, made arbitrary decisions. Where his father had walked through the street with a friend or two, nodding and speaking to all, Piero never appeared except on horseback, surrounded by hired guards, recognizing no one as he scattered people, carts, donkeys, produce, on his majestic way in and out of the city to his villas.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Even this might be forgiven," Prior Bichiellini observed, "if he were good at his job. But he is the poorest ruler Florence has had since our disastrous Guelph and Ghibelline civil wars. Visiting Italian princes from the city-states who come to renew their alliances do not like him, judge him without talent. All he can do is give orders. If only he had the good sense to hold open discussions with the Signoria..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is not in his character, Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then he had better start to learn. The opposition is beginning to join hands: Savonarola and his followers, the Medici cousins, Lorenzo and Giovanni, and their followers; the old families whom he is excluding; the disgruntled members of the City Council; the citizens who accuse him of neglecting the most pressing affairs of state to stage athletic contests, and arranging his tournaments so that he alone can win. We are in for troubled times...."</p>

  <p class="chapter">2.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroto, how much money are you holding for me?" demanded Michelangelo that evening.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buonarroto consulted his account book, told his brother how many florins were left from the palace savings.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good. It is enough to buy a piece of marble, and leave some over for rent."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you have a project?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, I have only the need. You must back me in my lie to Father. I shall tell him that I have a modest commission, and that they are paying for the marble plus a few scudi a month while I work. We'll pay this money to Lodovico from the savings."</p>

  <p class="normal">Buonarroto shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall say that the one commissioning has the right of rejection. In that way I'll protect myself if I can't sell it."</p>

  <p class="normal">With this Lodovico had to be content.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo then moved on to the next problem. What did he want to carve? He felt that the time had arrived to work his first statue in the round. But what figure? What was it to be about? The question was seminal; everything that emerged grew out of the original concept. No concept, no work of art; it was as simple, and as agonizingly complex, as that.</p>

  <p class="normal">The single desire of his heart rose out of love and sorrow: to do something about Lorenzo, a theme that would express the totality of talent, courage, width and depth of knowledge; the human understanding of this man who had undertaken to lead the world into an intellectual and artistic revolution.</p>

  <p class="normal">An answer was slow in coming; answers always were. Yet it was only by sticking doggedly to the task that he could arrive at a conception that would swing open the doors of his creative force. His thoughts kept returning to the fact that Lorenzo had often spoken of Hercules, suggesting that the Greek legend did not mean that his twelve labors were to be taken literally: the capture of the Erymanthian boar, the defeating of the Nemean lion, the cleaning of the Augean stables by running a river through. These feats perhaps were meant as symbols for all the varied and near-impossible tasks with which each new generation of man was faced.</p>

  <p class="normal">Was not Lorenzo the incarnation of Hercules? Had be not gone forth on twelve labors against ignorance, prejudice, bigotry, narrowness, intolerance? Surely he had set a Herculean pattern in founding universities, academies, art and manuscript collections, printing presses, in encouraging artists, scholars, poets, philosophers and scientists to reinterpret the world in vigorous modern terms, and to extend man's reach to all the fruits of the human intellect and spirit.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lorenzo had said, "Hercules was half man and half god, sprung from Zeus and the mortal Alcmene. He is the everlasting symbol that all of us are half man and half god. If we use that which is half god in us, we can perform the twelve labors every day of our lives."</p>

  <p class="normal">He must find a way to represent Hercules so that he became Lorenzo as well; not solely the physical giant of Greek legend as depicted on Giotto's Campanile, or in Pollaiuolo's nine-foot painting, but as poet, statesman, world merchant, patron, revolutionist.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the meanwhile he had to get out of the house, into his own workshop.</p>

  <p class="normal">Just as he had left bas-relief behind him, so he had outgrown Bertoldo's art of the miniature. Moreover he could not conceive of sculpturing the Hercules, or Lorenzo, in less than life size. By rights it should be half again as large as man, for they were demigods who needed heroic marble from which to be born. But where to find such marble? And how to pay for it? His savings contained but a tithe of such a cost.</p>

  <p class="normal">He remembered the workshop of the Duomo behind the vast cathedral which had been the headquarters for the workmen and materials while the cathedral was being built, and which was subsequently used by the foreman and his maintenance crew. In passing the gates, while materials were being moved in or out, he recalled having seen several large blocks of marble lying about. He walked to the workshop, made a tour of the yard. The foreman, bald as a slab of pink marble, and with a nose that stuck straight out like a leveled finger from his face, came up to ask if he could be of service. Michelangelo introduced himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was an apprentice in the Medici garden. Now I must work alone. I need a large marble, but I have little money. I thought the city might be willing to sell something it did not need."</p>

  <p class="normal">The foreman, a stonemason by trade, closed his eyes to the narrow protective slits against flying chips.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Call me Beppe. What interests you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo took a deep breath.</p>

  <p class="normal">"First, Beppe, this big column. The one that has been worked on."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's called the 'Duccio block.' Comes from Carrara. Stands seventeen, eighteen feet high. Board of Works of the Duomo bought it for Duccio to carve a Hercules. To save labor Duccio ordered it blocked out in the quarry. It reached here ruined. I was twelve then, apprenticed." Beppe scratched his behind vigorously with his six-toothed chisel. "Duccio cut for a week. He could find no figure in it, big or small."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo walked around the enormous block. He ran his fingers exploringly over it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Beppe, was this block really ruined in the quarry? It's awkwardly shaped, yes, but maybe Duccio spoiled it himself by these cuts, like here, where he gouged too deeply around the middle. Would the Board of Works sell it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not possible. They speak of using it one day."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then what about this smaller one? It also has been worked on, though not so badly."</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe examined the nine-foot block Michelangelo indicated.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I could ask. Come back tomorrow."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And would you plead price for me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The foreman opened his mouth in a toothless grin. "I never yet knew a stonecarver who had tomorrow's <i>pasta</i> money in today's purse."</p>

  <p class="normal">The answer was several days in coming, but Beppe had done a job for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"She's yours. I told them it was an ugly piece of meat and we'd be glad for the room. They told me to set a fair price. How about five florins?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Beppe! I could embrace you. I'll be back tonight with the money. Don't let it get away."</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe scratched his bald scalp with the end of an <i>ugnetto.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Now that he had his marble he had to find a workshop. Nostalgia drew him to the Medici garden. It was unused since Lorenzo's death, the summer grass high, uncut, turning brown, the little casino in the center stripped bare, only the piles of stones at the far end, where work on Lorenzo's library had been abandoned, remaining the same. He wondered, "Could I work in my old shed? It wouldn't hurt anything, or cost Piero anything. Perhaps he would let me if I told him what I was carving."</p>

  <p class="normal">He could not make himself go to Piero.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he turned to leave through the rear gate, the corner of his eye caught two figures coming through the main door from the Piazza San Marco: Contessina and Giuliano. They had not seen each other since Lorenzo's death. On the porch of the casino they came together. Contessina seemed to have shrunk in size; even in the bright July sun her face was sallow. All that was visible under the wide protective hat were her brown eyes, enormously alive.</p>

  <p class="normal">Giuliano spoke first.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why have you not come to see us? We have missed you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina's voice was reproachful. "You could have called."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...but Piero..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I too am a Medici. So is Giuliano." She was angry. "The palace is our home. Our friends are welcome."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I asked Contessina why you did not come," said the boy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have not been invited."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I invite you," she cried impulsively. "Giovanni must go back to Rome tomorrow, then we will be all alone, except for Piero and Alfonsina, and we never see them."</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina continued: "Pope Innocent is dying. Giovanni must be on hand to protect us against a Borgia being elected Pope."</p>

  <p class="normal">She looked out at the garden.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Giuliano and I walked over here nearly every day. We thought you would work, and where should you work but here?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, Contessina, I have not worked. But today I bought a piece of marble."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then we can come and visit you," said Giuliano eagerly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood blinking hard at Contessina.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have not the permission..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And if I secure it for you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He straightened up.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is a nine-foot column, Contessina. Very old. Badly used. But good inside. I'm going to carve a Hercules. He was your father's favorite."</p>

  <p class="normal">He reached out his hand for hers. Her fingers were surprisingly cold for a hot summer day.</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited patiently, one day, two, three, four, returning at the sunset hour. But she did not come. Then, on the fifth day, as he sat on the steps of the casino chewing on a handful of hay-brown grass, he saw her walk through the main gate. His heart leaped. Her old nurse was with her. He rushed down the path to meet her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her eyes were red.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Piero has refused!" he cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He has not answered. A hundred times I have asked him. He stands in silence. That is his way. Then it can never be said that he refused."</p>

  <p class="normal">High bright hope of continuing in the garden crashed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was afraid it would be so, Contessina. That is why I left the palace. And have not come back. Even to see you."</p>

  <p class="normal">She took a step closer. They now stood with their lips only an inch apart. The nurse turned away.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Piero says the Ridolfi family will be displeased if we see each other again.... Not until after my marriage, at least."</p>

  <p class="normal">Neither of them moved closer, their lips did not meet, their slight young bodies did not touch; yet he felt himself held and holding in a beloved embrace.</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina walked slowly down the center path, past the little bronze boy taking a thorn out of his foot in the now still fountain. Together she and the nurse disappeared into the piazza.</p>

  <p class="chapter">3.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe of the blue-veined, red cheeks, as ugly a man as the original Etruscans had left behind them, Beppe came to his rescue.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I tell the Board I can use part-time man, that you offer to work for no pay. For free a good Tuscan refuses nothing. Set up your shop along the far wall."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Florentines, who carried half a dozen family names and believed that a short name meant a short life and fortune, had named this workyard the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore del Duomo. It was an establishment that could carry its compounded title, for it occupied a full square behind a half-moon fringe of houses, studios and offices that lined the street behind the cathedral. In this front line of buildings Donatello, Della Robbia and Orcagna had carved their marbles, had cast their bronze pieces in the Opera furnaces.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wooden wall of the yard, semicircular in shape, had an overhang under which the workmen found protection from the beating sun in summer and the rain being driven down the valley of the Arno from the mountains in winter. Here Michelangelo set up a forge, brought sacks of chestnut wood and Swedish iron rods, fashioned himself a set of nine chisels and two hammers, made a drawing desk from pieces of lumber that looked as though they had been lying about the yard since Brunelleschi finished the dome.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he had a workshop where he could make his headquarters from first light to dark. Once again he could work within the sound of the hammers of the <i>scalpellini. </i>Then, settled in with drawing paper, charcoal, pens and colored inks, he was ready to begin.</p>

  <p class="normal">He asked himself questions, for his final result would depend on the ever widening and deepening circles of questions asked and answered. How old was Hercules at the moment of emerging from the marble? Were all twelve of the labors behind him, or was he halfway on his journey? Was he wearing the token of his triumph, the Nemean lion skin, or was he naked to the world? Would he have a sense of grandeur at how much he had been able to accomplish as a half god, or a sense of fatality that as a half human he would die poisoned by the blood of the centaur Nessus?</p>

  <p class="normal">He learned with the passing months that most of the charges against Lorenzo of debauching the morals and freedom of the Florentines were untrue, that he was perhaps the greatest human being since Pericles had brought in the golden age of Greece two thousand years before. How to convey that Lorenzo's accomplishments were as great as those of Hercules?</p>

  <p class="normal">First, Lorenzo was a man. As a man he would have to be re-created, brought to glowing life out of this weather-stained block of marble propped up by beams before him. He had to conceive of the strongest male that ever walked the earth, overwhelming in all his aspects. Where in Tuscany, land of small, lean, unheroically designed men, would he find such a model?</p>

  <p class="normal">He scoured Florence looking at coopers with their heavy wooden hammers, the wool dyers with their arms stained blue and green, the ironmongers, blacksmiths, rustic stone bevelers working the Strozzi palace; the porters running the streets bent double under their packs, the young athletes wrestling in the park, the near-naked sand dredgers in their flat boats pulling up spoons of Arno mud. He spent weeks in the countryside watching the farmers take in their grain and grapes, loading heavy sacks and boxes on carts, flailing the wheat, rolling the granite wheels of the olive crusher, chopping down old trees, building rock walls. Then he returned to the Duomo workshop where he doggedly drew every feature, limb, torso, back under tension, shoulder muscle lifting, arm pushing, thigh straining, until he had a folio of hundreds of fragments. He set up an armature, bought a supply of pure beeswax, began modeling... and was dissatisfied.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can I establish a figure, even the crudest outline, if I don't know what I'm doing? How can I achieve anything but surface skin sculpture, exterior curves, outlines of bones, a few muscles brought into play? Effects. What do I know of the causes? The vital structure of a man that lies beneath the surface, and that my eye can't see? How can I know what creates, from within, the shapes I see from without?"</p>

  <p class="normal">These questions he had already asked Bertoldo. Now he knew the answer. It had been buried within him for a long time. He came to grips with its necessity. There was no escape. He could never become any part of the sculptor he planned to be until he had trained himself through dissection; until he knew the workings of every last component within the human body, precisely what function it served and how it accomplished its end; the interrelation of all the parts, bone, blood, brain, muscle, tendon, skin, guts. Figures in the round had to be complete, seen from every angle. A sculptor could not create movement without perceiving what caused the propulsion; could not portray tension, conflict, drama, strain, force unless he saw every fiber and substance at work within the body that was shaping the power and drive; unless he knew what a movement in front did to the corresponding muscles behind; until he grasped the whole of the human body itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Learn anatomy he must! But how? Become a surgeon? That would take years. Even if he could follow that unlikely train, what good would it do to dissect two male corpses a year, in a group effort in the Piazza della Signoria?</p>

  <p class="normal">There must be some way that he could see a dissection.</p>

  <p class="normal">He remembered that Marsilio Ficino was the son of Cosimo de' Medici's doctor. He had been trained by his father until Cosimo had suggested that he was "born to doctor men's minds, not their bodies."</p>

  <p class="normal">He set out on foot for Careggi and Ficino's villa to lay his problem before the near sixty-year-old who was working night and day in his manuscript-strewn library in hopes of completing his commentary on Dionysius the Areopagite. He was admitted to the villa by Ficino's two pretty nieces and escorted into the library. The tiny founder of the Plato Academy sat beneath a bust of Plato, pen in inky fingers, deep furrows in his tight-skinned face.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo made it clear at once why he had come. Then added:</p>

  <p class="normal">"As the son of a doctor, trained to be a doctor yourself, you must know what the insides of a man is like."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I did not complete my medical studies."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you know if anyone is dissecting now?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Assuredly not! Don't you know the penalty for violating a corpse?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Banishment for life?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Death."</p>

  <p class="normal">After a silence, Michelangelo asked, "And if one were willing to risk it? How could it be gone about? Watch the poverty fields for burials?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Aghast, Ficino cried, "My dear young friend, you cannot conceive of yourself as a grave robber. How many times do you think you would succeed? You would be caught with the mutilated corpse and hanged from the third-floor window of the Palazzo della Signoria. Let's talk of other, more pleasant things. How does your sculpture go?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's what we have been talking about, dear Ficino."</p>

  <p class="normal">He stuck to his problem. Where to find available corpses? The dead of the rich were buried in the family tombs; those of the middle class were surrounded with religious ritual. Which dead in Florence were unwatched and unwanted? Only the very poor, the familyless, the mendicants who filled the roads of Italy. These people were taken to hospitals when they were sick. Which hospitals? Those attached to churches, with free beds. And the church with the largest charity hospital was the one that had the largest and best known free guesthouse.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>Santo Spirito!</span></i></p>

  <p class="normal">He could feel his hair crackle on his forehead. Santo Spirito, of which he knew not only the prior but every corridor, the library, guesthouse, gardens, hospital, cloisters.</p>

  <p class="normal">Could he ask Prior Bichiellini for his unclaimed corpses? If the prior were caught, something worse would happen to him than death: he would be put out of his order, excommunicated. Yet this was a courageous man who feared no force on earth so long as he did not personally offend God. How proud he was that a former prior of the order had befriended Boccaccio, the most hated and reviled man of his age: taken him in, protected him, used Boccaccio's library for the furthering of human knowledge. These Augustinians, when they thought they were right, knew not fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">And what was ever accomplished without risk? Had not an Italian from Genoa that very year sailed three little ships over the flat Atlantic Ocean from which he was told he would fall off, seeking for a new route to India?</p>

  <p class="normal">If the prior were willing to take the awful risk, could he, Michelangelo, be so selfish as to ask it? Would the ends warrant that risk?</p>

  <p class="normal">He spent agitated days and sleepless nights coming to his decision. He would approach Prior Bichiellini with an honest, straightforward request, telling precisely what he wanted and needed. He would not insult the prior by being subtle; there was nothing subtle about excommunication or a hangman's noose.</p>

  <p class="normal">But before he was willing to talk to the prior he had to know precisely how the plan could operate. Step by step he groped his way forward. With trepidation he moved in the stonemason's rhythm of no thought for the seven count of the chisel hammering on the stone, and only the few words that could be formulated during the one two three four rest period between chipping. He wandered through Santo Spirito, the cloisters, the outside vegetable gardens, the streets and little alleys that surrounded the section, checking entrances, observation points, approaches to the burial chapel, and within the monastery itself the location of the dead room where the bodies were kept overnight until burial in the morning.</p>

  <p class="normal">He drew up diagrams, accurate and in scale, of the juxtaposition of the guesthouse to the hospital, the monks' quarters. He traced the route by which he could enter from the back gate on the Via Maffia without being seen, make his way through the gardens and corridors to the dead room. He would come late at night and leave before morning light.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had to decide when to state his case, the right moment and place, both to increase his chances and to achieve clarity. The place to face up to the prior was in his writing study, amidst his books and manuscripts.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior let him recite only a part of his proposal, took a quick look at the diagrams spread out on the desk before him, then stopped him cold.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Enough! I comprehend fully. Let us never mention this subject again. You have not brought it up. It has vanished like smoke, leaving no trace."</p>

  <p class="normal">Stunned by the rapidity of the rejection, Michelangelo gathered his maps and found himself standing out in the Piazza Santo Spirito, suddenly cold under an overcast autumnal sky, blind to the market bustling about him in the piazza, aware only that he had put the prior in an intolerable situation. The prior would never want to see him again. The church he could go into; it belonged to everybody, but not the cloisters. He had lost his privileges.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked through the blustery streets, sat numbly in front of his Hercules block. What right had he to carve a Hercules, to attempt to interpret Lorenzo's favorite figure? He rubbed his fingers over the bones of his nose as though it were hurting for the first time.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was desolate.</p>

  <p class="chapter">4.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was sitting on a bench before a large fresco. Santo Spirito was quiet after the early morning service. An occasional woman, her head covered with a black handkerchief, knelt before the altars. A man entered, genuflected, and hurried out. A heavy scent of incense was suspended in the sun's rays.</p>

  <p class="normal">Prior Bichiellini came out from the sacristy, saw Michelangelo and walked toward him. He stood for a moment studying the few hesitant lines of the drawing, then asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where have you been these past weeks, Michelangelo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I... I..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How is the sculpture going?"</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no change in his manner, it showed the same interest and affection.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's... sitting there...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I thought of you when we received a new illuminated manuscript. There are some figure drawings from the fourth century that might interest you. Would you like to see them?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo rose timidly and followed the prior through the sacristy, across the cloister and into his study. On the desk was a beautiful parchment manuscript illustrated in blue and gold. The prior reached into his desk and took out a long key which he laid across the binding to keep the leaves spread. They talked for a few moments, then the prior said:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Allora, </span></i><span>we both have work to do. Come back again soon."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo returned to the church, enveloped in a warm glow. He had not lost the prior's friendship. He had been forgiven, the incident forgotten. If he were no farther along on his search for anatomy, at least he had done no irreparable damage.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he had no intention of abandoning the search. He sat on the hard bench, unable to work, wondering whether grave robbing was not the most workable solution, since it involved no one else. Yet how was he to dig up a corpse, refill the grave against passers-by, carry the cadaver to a nearby house, return it to the cemetery when he had completed his explorations? It seemed physically impossible.</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to the library of Santo Spirito to look among its books for new clues on how the ancients had conceived of Hercules. At the same time he found one illustrated medical manuscript showing how patients were tied to rope mattresses before being operated on; but no illustration of what the surgeon had found after the cutting.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the prior offered his assistance, finding him a heavy leather volume on one of the higher shelves, scanning through it, exclaiming, "Ah yes, here is some material," laying the heavy bronze key across the pages.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not until the fourth or fifth session that Michelangelo began to notice the key, of and by itself. The prior used it not only to keep books open but as a place marker when he closed a volume, a pointer when he was underscoring lines.</p>

  <p class="normal">Always the key. Always the same key. But never when he was in the study with others, either monks or lay friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">Why?</p>

  <p class="normal">He went back a dozen times in the following weeks. If he set about his drawing for an hour or two the prior would come through the church, greet him cheerily, invite him into the study. And invariably the big bronze key came out of the desk.</p>

  <p class="normal">At night Michelangelo lay awake, seeing the key before him. During the day he went for long walks in the fall rain up to the Maiano quarry, holding dialogues with himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It must mean something. But what? What are keys for? Obviously to open doors. How many doors are there in which I am interested? Only one. The dead-room door."</p>

  <p class="normal">He would have to take a gamble. If the prior meant for him to have it, well and good; if he did not, then he would simply carry it off by accident, forgetfully, and return it the next day. During the night he would let himself in through the rear garden gate of the monastery, make his way to the dead room. If the key fitted the door, then his assumption would be correct If it did not...</p>

  <p class="normal">It was midnight when he reached the monastery, having slipped out of his house noiselessly so as to waken no one, and taken a circuitous route to the hospital from Santa Croce across the Ponte Vecchio, past the Pitti palace, through a maze of side streets. In this way he missed the night guards who followed a prescribed route with their lanterns and could be seen a piazza away.</p>

  <p class="normal">He hugged the walls of the infirmary on the Via Sant'Agostino, turned into the Via Maffia to the little gate in the center of the block above which the fresco of Our Lady with the Child by Agnolo Gaddi gleamed softly in the darkness. All Santo Spirito keys opened this gate; he admitted himself, slipped past the stables on his left, avoided the main walk because the next building was the dormitory for lay brothers, skirted the walls of the dark kitchen, his breath coming a little faster now, made an angular dart to the inner wall of the infirmary.</p>

  <p class="normal">He found the open, central arch, slipped into the corridor admitting to the cells for patients, the doors of which were closed, and turned toward the dead room. An oil lamp stood at a niche. He took a candle out of the green canvas bag he carried, lighted the wick, shielded it under his cape.</p>

  <p class="normal">His only serious danger was from the chief of the infirmary; but since the monk was also encharged with the administration of the properties of the order, working from dawn to dark supplying the needs of the infirmary, guest-house and monastery, he was not likely to venture out of his cell on nocturnal inspections. Once the five o'clock supper was served, the patients were made ready for sleep and the doors of their cells closed. There was no resident doctor; the patients were not expected to grow sicker or ask for help during the night. They docilely did what was expected of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood for a moment rigid, before the door of the dead room. He inserted the big key, made a slow movement to the right, then left, felt the lock slip. In an instant he had opened the door, darted into the room, closed and locked the door behind him. And at this moment of commitment he did not know whether he dared face the task ahead.</p>

  <p class="normal">The dead room was small, about eight feet by ten, windowless. The stone walls were whitewashed, the floor of rough blocks. In the center of the room, on narrow planks mounted on two wooden horses, and wrapped from head to foot in a burial sheet, was a corpse.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood leaning against the door, breathing hard, the candle shaking in his hand like trees in a <i>tramontana. </i>It was the first time he had been alone in a room with death, let alone locked in, and on a sacrilegious errand. His flesh felt as though it were creeping along his bones; he was more frightened than he had ever been in his life.</p>

  <p class="normal">Who lay wrapped in that sheet? What would he find when be unrolled the body and dropped the winding cloth to the floor? What had this unfortunate creature done that he should now, without his knowledge or consent, be mutilated?</p>

  <p class="normal">"What kind of nonsense is this?" he demanded of himself. "What difference could it make to a man already dead? His body does not get into the kingdom of heaven, only his soul. I have no intention of dissecting this poor fellow's soul, even if I should stumble across it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Reassured by his own grim humor, he put down his bag and looked for a place to set his candle, of importance to him not only for light but as a clock as well: for he had to be safely out of here before three in the morning when the monks who operated the large bakehouse on the corner of the Via Sant'Agostino and Piazza Santo Spirito rose to make the day's bread for the monastery, the deserving poor and the relatives of all who lived here. It had taken much experimenting to ascertain with accuracy how long each type of candle would burn. This one, for which he was now searching for a resting place, was the three-hour variety; when it began its first sputtering he would have to leave. He must also exercise care that no drippings could be discovered the next morning.</p>

  <p class="normal">He emptied his bag of its scissors and kitchen knife, flattened it on the floor, held the candle upside down for a moment, then secured it in the soft wax. He took off his cape, for he was already sweating in the cold room, laid it in a corner, uttered a jumbled prayer which sounded like, "Lord forgive me, for I know not what I do," and approached the corpse.</p>

  <p class="normal">First he would have to unroll it from its winding sheet. The trestle bench was narrow. He had not known that he could be so clumsy. Slowly he wrestled the stiff body, first raising the legs until the sheet pulled out from under the lower half, then lifting it from the waist and holding it in his left arm, against his chest, until he could maneuver the cloth from around the torso and head. The winding sheet was long, he had to go through the tortuous process five times before he finally divested the cadaver of its protective wrapping.</p>

  <p class="normal">He picked up his candle from the floor, held it aloft in his left hand to study the body. His first feeling was one of pity for this dead man. His second was one of fear:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"This is how I shall end up!"</span></i></p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly all the differences between life and death became apparent.</p>

  <p class="normal">The face was expressionless; the mouth semi-open, the skin green from gangrene. The man had been strongly built and was in mid-life when apparently he had received a stab wound in the chest. The cadaver had been here long enough to sink to the temperature of this freezing room.</p>

  <p class="normal">His nostrils picked up an odor, something like very old flowers dying in water. It was not strong, it fell away when he backed to the wall to get a moment of relief; but it came to him again as he approached the cadaver, and from that point remained in his nostrils inescapably.</p>

  <p class="normal">Where to begin? He raised the arm on the side closest to him and felt a cold such as he had never felt before. Not colder than anything else, but different. It was a cold filled with emotional content, a hard cold, not the skin, but the muscle under it. The skin was soft, like velvet. He felt disgust, as though an iron hand were squeezing his stomach. All his memories of warm arms and shoulders recurred to him. He withdrew.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a considerable time before he could pick up the knife from the floor, recall what he had read about the human body, the few illustrations he had seen. He poised over the cadaver, frozen himself, swallowing hard. Then he brought the knife down and made his first incision: from the chestbone down to the groin. But he had not exerted enough pressure. The skin was surprisingly tough.</p>

  <p class="normal">He started over. Now applying strength behind the knife, he found the substance under the skin quite soft. The skin opened about two inches. He asked himself, "Where is the blood?" for it did not flow. This increased his impression of cold and death. Then he saw the fat, a soft, deep yellow. He knew what it was, for he had seen fat cut from animals in the markets. He made a deeper cut to reach the muscle, which was different in color from the skin and the fat, and harder to cut. He studied the dark red columns of fibers. He cut again and saw the bowel.</p>

  <p class="normal">The smell was growing heavier. A nausea started within him. At the first cut he had summoned all his strength to proceed; now all sensations came together: the cold, fear, smell, reaction to death. He was repulsed by the slippery feeling of the tissue, the fat fluidifying on his fingers like oil. He wanted to put his hands in hot water and wash them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do I do now?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He trembled, hearing his voice echo off the stone walls. He was in little danger of being heard, for he was bound at his back by the solid wall beyond which lay the garden, to his side by the chapel reserved for the death services, on the infirmary side by stone through which no sound could penetrate.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was dark inside the cavity. He picked up the candle, secured the canvas bag under the foot of the cadaver, placed his candle at body height.</p>

  <p class="normal">All of his senses were heightened. The intestines that he now began to handle were cold, slippery, moving. A pain ricocheted through his own bowels. He took one side of the flap in one of his hands, the other side in the other, held them apart to have a careful look. He saw a pale gray transparent snake, long, going round and round in coils. It had a superficial aspect of mother-of-pearl, shining because humidified, filled up with something that moved and emptied when he touched it.</p>

  <p class="normal">His initial emotion of disgust was overcome by excitement. He picked up his knife and started to cut upwards from the bottom of the rib cage. The knife was not strong enough. He tried his scissors but had to angle along the ribs, one at a time. The rib bones were hard; it was like cutting wire.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly the candle began to splutter. Three hours already! He could not believe it. Yet he did not dare ignore the warning. He set his green bag and candle on the floor, picked up the winding sheet from the comer. The wrapping process was a thousandfold more difficult than the unwrapping because he could no longer turn the corpse on its side or the whole of its guts would spill out onto the floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">The perspiration ran down into his eyes, his heart pounded so loud he thought it would wake the monastery as he used the last vestige of his strength to lift the corpse from the table with one arm while he pulled the winding sheet under and around the necessary five times. He barely had a moment to make sure that the corpse was stretched out upon the planks as he had found it, to check the floor for possible stains or wax, before the candle gave its last flickering sputter and went out.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had enough control to take a wandering route home, stopping a dozen times to retch against the corners of buildings and in the darkness of open ground. The smell of the corpse was in his nostrils with every breath he took. When he reached home he was afraid to boil water on Lucrezia's glowing embers for fear the noise would wake the family; yet he could not live without getting the feel of that fat off his fingers. He hunted quietly for some harsh lye soap to use in the cold water.</p>

  <p class="normal">His body, as he got into bed, was icy. He huddled against his brother, but not even Buonarroto's warmth could help him. Several times be had to rise and retch into a pail. He heard Lucrezia get out of bed, dress and make her way through the kitchen and down the circular stairway to the street as the faintest tinge of pearl gray touched his window overlooking the stables on the Via dei Bentaccordi.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had chills and fever all day. Lucrezia made him a chicken broth, but he could not hold it down. The family came one by one into the bedroom to find out what was the matter with him. He lay there feeling as clammy as the corpse. Nothing was able to remove the smell of death from his nostrils. After he had assured Lucrezia that it was not her supper which had upset him, she returned to the kitchen to boil up an herb bouquet to cure him. Monna Alessandra examined him for spots. By late afternoon he was able to retain a little of the herb tea, for which he thanked Lucrezia most gratefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">About eleven o'clock he rose, slipped into his shoes, <i>calze, </i>warm shirt and cloak, and with his legs rickety beneath him, made his way to Santo Spirito.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no corpse in the dead room. Neither was there one on the following night. The two days gave him a chance to recover. On the third night he again found a body in its winding sheet on the planked table.</p>

  <p class="normal">The second cadaver was older, with white beard patches on a big red face, the skin tight, the fluid under the skin marbleized. This time he used his knife with more authority, opening the abdomen with a clean cut, then using his left hand to pry apart the rib cage, which made a noise like crackling wood. It remained attached at the collarbone.</p>

  <p class="normal">He picked up his candle and held the light close to the innards, for this was his first complete view. He saw something pale red, netlike in design, and of solid tissue, which he deduced was the lungs. This network had a black covering, something that he had heard happened to wool workers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Experimentally, he pressed the lung; a hissing noise came out of the mouth of the corpse. He dropped the candle in fright. Fortunately it did not go out. When he regained his calm and had picked up the candle, he realized that in touching the lung he had forced out the residual air; and for the first time he understood what breathing was, because he could see and feel and hear the communication between the lungs and the mouth, realized what it did to the whole figure.</p>

  <p class="normal">After he had moved aside the lung he noticed a dark red mass; this must be the heart. It was covered by a shining membrane. Probing, he found that all of the tissue was connected to a form shaped something like an apple, almost free in the chest, attached only at the top of the pyramid.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Shall I take it out?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He hesitated a moment, then picked up his scissors, cut across the pyramidal membrane. Substituting his knife, he peeled away the membrane as though he were opening a banana. Now he had the heart in his two hands. Unexpectedly, he was hit by an emotional impact as strong as Hercules' club. If the soul and heart were one, what happened to this unfortunate cadaver's soul now that he had cut out its heart?</p>

  <p class="normal">As quickly as it had come, the fear departed. In its place came a sense of triumph. He was holding a human heart in his hands! He felt the happiness that arises out of knowledge, for now he knew about the most vital organ of the body, what it looked like, how it felt. He opened the heart with his knife, was shocked to find that there was nothing inside. He replaced it in its cavity, put back the chest's rib structure, which artists had observed so well from the lean Tuscans around them. But now he knew precisely where the heart beat beneath it.</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not have the faintest idea of how to start work on the snake of the intestine. He picked up a piece, pulled. It came easily for a time, about five feet of it; the bowels were attached loosely to the posterior wall, and came away. Then he began to feel resistance. The upper part was enlarged, a sort of bag was attached, which he deduced was the stomach. He had to use his knife to cut it loose.</p>

  <p class="normal">He freed some twenty-five feet of bowel, fingered it, feeling the differences of size and content. Some places had fluid in them, some solid; he learned that it was a continuous channel, with no opening from the beginning to the end. To get a concept of its interior aspect he cut into it with his knife at several points. The lower bowel contained stools. The smell was terrible.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tonight he had a four-hour candle, but already it began to splutter. He bundled the viscera back into the abdominal cavity, and with great difficulty got the corpse rewrapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">He ran to the fountain in the Piazza Santo Spirito and scrubbed his hands, but he could net get the feeling of dirt off his fingers. He stuck his head into the icy water to wash away the sense of guilt, standing for a moment with his hair and face dripping water; then ran all the way home, shaking as though with ague.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was emotionally exhausted.</p>

  <p class="normal">He awoke to find his father standing over him, a displeased look on his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, get up. It's noon. Lucrezia is putting food on the table. What kind of new nonsense is this, that you sleep until dinner? Where were you last night?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo lay staring up at Lodovico.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm sorry, Father. I'm not feeling well."</p>

  <p class="normal">He washed carefully, combed his hair, put on fresh clothing and went to the table. He thought he was going to be all right. When Lucrezia brought in a bowl of beef stew, he rushed back into his bedroom and retched into the chamber pot until his insides were sore.</p>

  <p class="normal">But that night be was back in the dead room.</p>

  <p class="normal">Before he had the door locked behind him he was drenched in the smell of putrefaction. He unwound the sheet, saw that the left leg of the corpse was of a brown color with a green secretion coming out from under the skin, the leg swollen half again its size. The rest of the body was ash gray, the face completely sunken.</p>

  <p class="normal">He began to work where he had left off the night before, cutting directly to the bowel, and unraveled it piece by piece. He placed it on the floor and raised his candle close to the cavity. There were a number of the organs he had been searching for: the spleen on the left side, the liver on the right. He recognized the liver from the beeves and lambs cut up in the markets; bilaterally, just aside of the bone column, were the kidneys.</p>

  <p class="normal">He picked them up carefully and perceived that they were connected with the bladder by small tubes, like wires. He went on to where the liver was attached, posteriorly; cut the ligaments with his scissors and removed it from the cavity. He studied the shape in his hands, examining the small bladder attached to its lower side, opened it with his knife. A dark green fluid came out.</p>

  <p class="normal">He moved his candle closer, saw something that he had missed before: the abdominal cavity was separated from the chest cavity by a dome-shaped muscle. In the center of this dome were two holes through which passed tubes connecting the stomach with the mouth. The second big channel, alongside the backbone, went up into the chest. He now realized that from the chest to the abdomen there were only two means of communication, one bringing food and liquids. The other baffled him. He lifted the bone structure of the chest but could not determine what the second channel was used for. The candle spluttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he crept silently up the stairs of his house he found his father waiting for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where have you been? What is that horrible odor about you? You smell like death."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo mumbled an excuse with eyes cast down, brushed past Lodovico to the security of his bedroom.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could not sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Will I never get used to this?" he groaned.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next night there was no corpse in the dead room. He had an uneasy feeling of impending danger as he noticed that the section of floor where he had allowed the bowels to rest had been scrubbed, and was brighter than the stones around it. A bit of wax from his candle had been left untouched at the foot of the plank table. Yet even if his activities had been noticed, he was protected by the vow of silence in the monastery.</p>

  <p class="normal">The following night he found a boy of about fifteen who showed no external evidence of disease. The pale skin, almost completely white, was soft to the touch. The eyes were blue when he raised the lids, deep in color, contrasting with the pale white of the eyelids. Even in death he was attractive.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Surely he will wake up," he murmured.</p>

  <p class="normal">He saw that the boy was still without hair on his chest, and felt a pity deeper than he had known since he had viewed his first corpse.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned away; he'd wait until another night. Then, facing the corner of the whitewashed walls, he stopped. By the next morning this lad would be buried under four feet of earth in the Santo Spirito cemetery. He touched the boy, found him as cold as winter; beautiful, but as dead as all the others.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made his incisions expertly now, put his hand under the chestbone. It came away easily. Up toward the neck he felt a tubelike appendage, about an inch in diameter, that gave the impression of a series of hard rings; among these rings he found a soft membranous tube that came down from the neck. He could not find where this tube ended and the lung began, but when he pulled on it the boy's neck and mouth moved. He took his hand out swiftly and shuddered away from the table.</p>

  <p class="normal">A moment later he cut the tube blindly, not being able to see it, then lifted the lungs out separately. They were light in weight and when he squeezed them be found that the sensation was rather like squeezing snow. He tried to cut the lung open with his knife, put it on the table and, with a hard surface under him, found that it was like cutting through dry sponge. In one of the lungs he found a pale yellow-white mucus which kept the lung moist, in the other a pink-red mucus. He wanted to get his hand down the boy's mouth in order to search out the throat and neck, but the feel of the teeth and tongue repelled him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly he felt as though someone were in the room with him, though he knew it was impossible because he had locked the door from the inside. Tonight was just too difficult.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wrapped up the corpse easily, for it weighed so little, put it back on the table, and let himself out.</p>

  <p class="chapter">5.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could not risk his father's again detecting the odor of death, so he walked the streets until he found a wineshop in the workmen's quarter that was open. He drank a little of the Chianti. When the proprietor turned his back, he sprinkled the rest of the wine over his shirt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico was outraged when he smelled the strong wine.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not enough that you wander the streets all night doing God alone knows what, associating with what manner of loose women, but now you come home smelling like a cheap tavern. I can't understand you. What is driving you to these evil ways?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The only protection he could give his family was to keep them in ignorance. It was best for his father to believe that he was carousing, about which Lodovico was learning a great deal from Giovansimone, who frequently came in with his face bloodied and clothes torn. But as the days passed, and Michelangelo stumbled into the house every morning toward dawn, the family rose in arms. Each was outraged for his own special reason. Lucrezia because he was not eating, his uncle Francesco because he was afraid Michelangelo would run into debt, his aunt Cassandra on moral grounds. Only Buonarroto brought a smile to his brother's lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know you are not carousing," he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How could you know that?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Simple: you haven't asked me for a scudo since you bought those candles. Without money you do not buy women in Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">He realized that he would have to find somewhere else for his daily rest. The Topolinps would never ask questions, he could stay there, but Settignano was so far away; he would lose valuable hours coming and going. In the morning he went to the Duomo workshop and mounted the stool before his drawing table. Beppe came over to greet him, a puzzled expression on his homely old face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My young friend, you look like a cadaver. What have you been making with yourself?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked up sharply.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've been... working, Beppe."</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe cackled toothlessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, that I were young enough for that kind of work! Well, do not try to raise Hercules' club every night. Remember, what you put into the ladies at night you don't have left to spend on marble in the morning."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night he came across his first ugly corpse, one that made him shiver as he observed what could happen to God's handiwork. The man was about forty, with a big dark red face, swollen near the neck. The mouth was open, the lips blue, the whites of the eyes full of red spots. Through the yellow teeth he could see the dark red tongue, swollen, filling almost the whole mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">He put his hand on the man's face. The cheeks felt like uncooked dough. Now seemed a good time to get at the structure of the human face. He picked up the smaller of his knives and cut from the hairline to the bridge of the nose. He tried to peel the skin off the forehead but he could not, it was too closely attached to the bone. He cut on top of each eyebrow to the edge of the eye, stripped the skin from the corner of the eye outward, continued from the eye to the ear, then down along the cheekbone.</p>

  <p class="normal">The effect of this mutilation was so ghastly that he could not work on it. He picked up the winding sheet from the corner, covered the man's head, and turned his attention to the hipbone, to the fibered muscles of the heavy thigh.</p>

  <p class="normal">A couple of nights later when there was a new corpse, he cut lightly into the skin of the face, peeling it off with his scissors. Under the thin yellow tissue of fat he discovered a large membrane of red muscular tissue which went continuously from the ear around the lips to the other ear. Now he had his first understanding of how these muscles could move the face to laughter, smiles, tears, grief.</p>

  <p class="normal">Under it was a thicker tissue extending from the corner of the jaw to the base of the skull. Putting his finger under this second layer, he pushed the tissue a little and saw the jaw move. He worked it up and down to simulate the chewing movement, then searched for the muscle that would move the eyelid. He had to see inside the cavity of the eye to know what made it move. Trying to push his finger inside, he exerted too much pressure. The eye globe broke. A white mucus poured out over his fingers, leaving the cavity empty.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned away terror-stricken, walked to a corner of the whitewashed wall and crushed his forehead against its coldness, fighting desperately the desire to retch. When he had regained control of himself he went back to the corpse, cut the tissue from around the second eye, found where it was attached at the bottom of the cavity. Then putting his finger in above the eye and moving it slowly. Inside, he plucked it out. He turned it around and around in his hand, trying to find out how it moved. He held his candle close, peered into the empty cavity. On the bottom he could perceive a hole through which gray soft tissuelike wires went up into the skull. Until he could remove the top <i>of </i>the skull and expose the brain, he could learn nothing about how an eye sees.</p>

  <p class="normal">His candle had only a bit of tallow. He cut the flesh away from the bridge of the nose, saw clearly what had happened to his own under Torrigiani's fist.</p>

  <p class="normal">The candle spluttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Where to go? He dragged himself away from Santo Spirito. His body ached with tiredness, his eyes smarted, his stomach and spirits were in a state of revulsion. He could not face Lodovico, who would surely be waiting for him at the top of the stairs, screaming that he was going straight to the Stinche.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made his way to the workshop of the Duomo. It was easy to throw his bag over the gate, then hoist himself over. In the moonlight the blocks of white marble glistened with white luminosity, the chips around the semi-finished columns were like snow, clean and refreshing. The cold air settled his stomach. He went toward his workbench, cleared a place under it, stretched out, covered himself with a heavy piece of canvas and fell asleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">He woke a few hours later; the sun had risen. In the piazza he could hear the noise of the <i>contadini </i>setting up their stalls. He walked to the fountain, washed, bought himself a slice of <i>parmigiano, </i>two thick-crusted <i>panini, </i>and returned to the workyard.</p>

  <p class="normal">He tried to cut marble around the edges of the Hercules block, thinking that the feel of the iron instruments would bring him enjoyment. He soon set them down, climbed up on his stool and began to draw: the arm, muscles and joints, the jaw, the heart, the head. When Beppe arrived, came close to give him a <i>buon giorno, </i>he spread a concealing hand over the sheet before him. Beppe stopped short; but not before he got a look at an empty eye socket and exposed viscera. He shook his head grimly, turned and walked away. At noon Michelangelo went home to dinner, to allay Lodovico's fears about his absence.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took him several days to work up the courage to return to the dead room and crack a man's skull. Once there he began working rapidly with hammer and chisel, cutting backward from the bridge of the nose. It was a nerve-racking experience, for the head moved each time he made a stroke. Nor did he know how much force to exert to break the bone. He could not get the skull open. He covered the head, turned the man over, spent the rest of the night studying the structure of the spinal column.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the next cadaver he did not make the mistake of cutting backward on the skull, but instead cut around the head, from the tip of the left ear along the hairline, taking three or four hard blows of the hammer to penetrate the half inch of bone. There was now room enough to keep his scalpel under the skull and cut all the way around. A white-yellow cream escaped; the fissure opened wider. When he had cut the bone more than halfway, he used his scalpel as a lever and ripped. The skull lifted off in his hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was like dry wood. He was so shaken he barely prevented its dropping onto the floor. He shifted his eyes from the skull to the corpse. He was horrified, for with the top of the head off, the face was absolutely destroyed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again he was overcome by a sense of guilt; but with the skull lifted off he had his first look at a human brain. As an artist he had been fascinated by what created expression; what was it in the brain that enabled the face to convey emotion? Holding his candle close to the brainpan, he saw that the mass inside was yellow-white, with red-blue lines on the surface, the arteries and veins going in all directions. He could see that the mass of the brain was divided in the middle, exactly corresponding to the divided line of the skull. He could detect no odor, but to his first touch it was wet, very soft and even, like the skin of a soft fish.</p>

  <p class="normal">He put the skull back on top of the head, wrapping the sheet tightly at the top to hold it in place. He was neither ill nor distressed as he had been on most other nights, but could hardly wait to get back to his next corpse and open the brain itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he took off his next skull he was astonished to think that men could be so different when their brains looked and felt so much alike. From this he deduced that there must be a physical substance inside the brain which differed with each man. Using his index finger, he moved around the base of the skull, learned that the brain was completely detached and free from the bone. Putting his fingers in on both sides, he tried to take it out whole. It would not lift.</p>

  <p class="normal">Where his fingers came together the mass was attached by something like a series of wires to the bottom of the skull basin. He cut the wires, pulled out the mass. It was so soft, and at the same time so slippery, he had to concentrate tremendously just to hold it together. He looked at it in wonderment and admiration: from this relatively small substance, which could weigh no more than a couple of pounds, emerged all the greatness of the human race: art, science, philosophy, government, all that men had become for good as well as evil.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he cut the brain down the line of division it was similar to cutting very soft cheese; there was no noise, no spoilage, no odor. The two halves were exactly alike. No matter where he cut, it was all the same, gray in color, a little yellowish. He pushed the corpse over on the table to make enough space to lay the brain out on the wooden plank, and was amazed to see that in and by itself it had no structure, that it slowly collapsed over the wooden boards.</p>

  <p class="normal">The holes in the skull he found filled with the same wire-like substance he had had to break in order to detach the brain. Following these strands down through the neck, he surmised that this substance was the sole connection between the brain and the body. The front holes he discerned were between the brain and the eyes; the other two holes corresponded to the ears. He pushed through the inch-and-a-half hole at the back base of the skull, connecting to the vertebrae; this was the connection between the brain and the back.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was exhausted now, for he had worked for five hours and was glad when his candle burned out.</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat on the edge of the fountain in the Piazza Santo Spirito throwing cold water at his face and asking himself:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Am I obsessed to be doing these things? Have I the right to do this just because I say it is for sculpture? What price might I have to pay for this precious knowledge?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Spring arrived, the air warmed. Beppe told him of some sculpture that needed doing for the new vault of the vestibule of Santo Spirito: carved capitals and a number of worked stones to decorate the vault and the doors. It never occurred to him to ask Prior Bichiellini to intervene. He went directly to the foreman in charge of constructing the square stone vault and asked for the job. The foreman did not want a student. Michelangelo offered to bring his Madonna and Child and Centaurs to prove that he could do the work. The foreman reluctantly agreed to look. Bugiardini borrowed one of Ghirlandaio's carts, came to the Buonarroti house, helped him wrap and carry the marbles down the stairs. They stowed them safely on a bed of straw, then wheeled the cart through the streets, across the Ponte Santa Trinita to Santo Spirito.</p>

  <p class="normal">The foreman was unimpressed. The pieces were not suited to what he had to do.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Besides, I already hired my two men."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sculptors?" Michelangelo was surprised.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What then?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What are their names?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Giovanni di Betto and Simone del Caprina."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Never heard of them. Where were they trained?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In a silversmith's shop."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you ornamenting the stones with silver?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"They worked at Prato on a similar job. They are experienced."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And I am not? After three years in Lorenzo's sculpture garden, under Bertoldo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't take it so hard, son. These are older men with families to support. You know how little marble work there is. But of course if you brought an order from Piero de' Medici, since you are a Medici prot√©g√©, and Piero is paying for the work..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo and Bugiardini wheeled the reliefs through the cobbled streets, put them back under the bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodivico waited resignedly for his son to reform. Michelangelo continued to come in at dawn, after having dissected the knee and ankle bone, the corresponding elbow and wrist bone, the hip and pelvis, the private parts. He studied the muscular structure again and again, the shoulders and forearms, the thighs and calves. Lodovico cornered him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I order you to give up this dissolute life at once, to go back to work during the day and to bed after supper at night."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Give me a little more time, Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">Giovansimone was delighted that Michelangelo had taken off on the wild life. Florence was agog over its latest scandal: Piero had interceded with the Dominican authorities and had Savonarola banished to Bologna as "too great a partisan of the people." But for Giovansimone there had been no change in activity.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How about coming with me tonight? I'm going where there's good gambling and whoring."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, thank you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not? Are you too good to go out with me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Everyone to his own evil, Giovansimone."</p>

  <p class="chapter">6.</p>

  <p class="normal">An unexpected death put an end to his dissecting. Working in robust good health, Domenico Ghirlandaio contracted a pestilence and in two days was dead. Michelangelo went to the <i>bottega </i>to take his place with Granacci, Bugiardini, Cieco, Baldinelli, Tedesco and Jacopo on one side of the coffin, while the son, brothers and brother-in-law stood on the other, and the friends came to say good-by. Together they all walked behind the funeral procession, over the route on which Michelangelo had driven the cart for his first day of frescoing in Santa Maria Novella, to attend the mass, and then the burial.</p>

  <p class="normal">That afternoon he went to visit Prior Bichiellini, casually laid the long bronze key over the pages of the book the prior was reading, and said, "I should like to carve something for the church."</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior showed pleasure but not surprise.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have long felt the need of a crucifix for the central altar. I've always envisioned it in wood."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Wood? I wonder if I can?"</p>

  <p class="normal">For once he had the good sense not to say, "Wood is not my trade." If the prior wanted a Crucifixion in wood, then wood it must be, though he had never even whittled. There was no material of sculpture that Bertoldo had not obliged him to handle: wax, clay, the varying stones. But never wood; probably because Donatello had not touched wood for the last thirty-five years of his life, after he had completed his Crucifixion for Brunelleschi.</p>

  <p class="normal">He accompanied the prior through the sacristy. The prior stopped and pointed out the arch behind the main altar, which formed one of the two entries to the chancel, then asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could it carry a life-size figure?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will have to draw the arches and the altar to scale to be sure; but I should think it could be almost life size. May I work in the monastery carpenter shop?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The brothers would be pleased to have you."</p>

  <p class="normal">The lay brothers in the carpenter shop worked with sunlight streaming on their shoulders from overhead windows. In the relaxed atmosphere of the workbenches he was treated as another carpenter come to make still one more useful article among the hundreds needed for Santo Spirito. Though there was no order of silence in the busy shop, no one who liked to gab ever came close to an Augustinian monastery.</p>

  <p class="normal">This suited Michelangelo; he felt at home working in the comfortable silence framed by the pleasant sounds of saw, plane and hammer. The smell of sawdust was salutary. He worked on the various woods the monastery had to offer to get the knack of carving in this material which he found so unlike marble. The wood did not seem to fight back.</p>

  <p class="normal">He took to reading the New Testament, the story of Christ as related by Matthew and Mark. The more he read, the more the terror-laden, agony-infused Crucifixion of previous centuries to be seen in the chapels of Florence, receded from his mind, and into it came the image of Prior Bichiellini: cheerful, hearty, dedicated, serving all humanity in God's name, with a great mind and noble spirit that gloried in living.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a need of his nature to be original. But what could one say about Christ on the cross that had not been carved and painted before? Though the theme of the Crucifixion would not have occurred to him, he was eager to do something particularly fine to justify the prior's faith in him. The finished work would have to be intensely spiritual, lest the prior wonder if he had made a mistake in letting him dissect.</p>

  <p class="normal">He started drawing in front of the earliest Crucifixions, those of the thirteenth century, carved with the head and knees of Christ turned in the same direction, perhaps because this was the simplest form for the sculptor and because the design evoked, in terms of emotion, the simplicity of unquestioning acceptance. By the fourteenth century the sculptors were showing Christ in full face, with all parts of the body symmetrically disposed on either side of a central, structural line.</p>

  <p class="normal">He spent time in front of Donatello's Santa Croce Crucifixion, marveling at the magnificence of its conception. Whatever emotion Donatello had set out to achieve, strength combined with idyllic fulfillment, power to forgive as well as subdue, the ability to be destroyed as well as resurrected, all these emotions he had succeeded in conveying. Yet Michelangelo did not feel within himself any of the things that Donatello felt. He had never been altogether clear in his own mind why God could not accomplish by Himself all the things He sent His son down on earth to do. Why did God need a son? The exquisitely balanced Donatello Christ said to him:</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is how God wanted it to be, exactly the way it was planned. It is not hard to accept one's fate when it has been preordained. I have anticipated this pain."</p>

  <p class="normal">This was not acceptable to Michelangelo's temperament. What had the violent end to do with God's message of love? Why did He permit violence to take place, when its very form would create hatred, fear, retribution and continuing violence? If He were omnipotent, why had He not devised a more peaceable way to bring His message to the world? His impotence to stop this barbarism was a terrifying thought to Michelangelo... and perhaps to Christ as well.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he stood in the bright sunlight on the steps of Santa Croce, watching the boys play football on the hard earth of the square, then walked slowly past the palaces of the Via de' Bardi, patting affectionately the carved stones of the buildings as he went by, he thought:</p>

  <p class="normal">"What went through the mind of Christ between the sunset hour when the Roman soldier drove the first nail through his flesh, and the hour when he died? For these thoughts would determine not only how he accepted his fate, but also the position of his body on the cross. Donatello's Christ accepted in serenity, and thought nothing. Brunelleschi's Christ was so ethereal that he died at the first touch of the nail, and had no time to think."</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to his workbench, began exploring his mind with charcoal and ink. On Christ's face appeared the expression, "I am in agony, not from the iron nails, but from the rust of doubt." He could not bring himself to convey Christ's divinity by anything so obvious as a halo; it had to be portrayed through an inner force, strong enough to conquer his misgivings at this hour of severest trial.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was inevitable that his Christ would be closer to man than to God. He did not know that he was to be crucified. He neither wanted it nor liked it. And as a result his body was twisted in conflict, torn, like all men, by inner questioning.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was ready to begin carving he had before him a new concept: he turned Christ's head and knees in opposite directions, establishing through this contrapuntal design a graphic tension, the intense physical and spiritual inner conflict of a man who is being pulled two ways.</p>

  <p class="normal">He carved his figure in the hardest wood available in Tuscany, walnut, and when he had finished with hammer and chisel, sandpapered it down, and rubbed the surface with stainless oil and wax. His fellow carpenters made no comment, but they stopped by his bench to observe progress. Nor, for that matter, did the prior enter into a discussion of its message. He said simply:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Every artist's Crucifixion is a self-portrait. It is what I envisioned for the altar. Thank you."</p>

  <p class="normal">On Sunday morning Michelangelo brought his family to Santo Spirito. He led them to a bench close to the altar. His Christ loomed above them. His grandmother whispered:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You make me feel compassion for him. Always before I thought Christ was feeling compassion for me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico was not feeling compassion for anybody. He asked, "How large was the commission?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It wasn't a commission. I volunteered."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You mean you're not getting paid?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The prior has been good to me. I wanted to repay my debt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good to you in what way?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...well... he let me copy the works of art..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The church is open to everybody."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the monastery. And to use his library."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is a public library. Are you <i>pazzo, </i>crazy, that a penniless lad should work free for a rich monastery?"</p>

  <p class="normal">A heavy snowstorm that lasted for two days and nights left Florence a white city. Sunday dawned clear, crisp and cold. He was alone in the enclosed Duomo workshop, huddled over a brazier while trying to make the first of the Hercules drawings, when Piero's groom came looking for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"His Excellency, Piero de' Medici, asks if you could come to the palace."</p>

  <p class="normal">He made his way to the barber in the straw market, where he had his hair cut, and patches of beard down the sides of his cheek and chin shaved, then returned home, boiled himself a tub of hot water, bathed, put on his blue wool tunic and set out for the first time in over a year and a half for the palace. The statues in the courtyard, as he came through, were piled high with snow. He found the Medici children and grandchildren assembled in Lorenzo's <i>studiolo, </i>a bright fire burning.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Giuliano's birthday. Cardinal Giovanni, who had settled in a small but exquisite palace in the quarter of Sant'Antonio when a hostile Borgia had been elected Pope, looked plumper than ever sitting in Lorenzo's chair, hovered over by his cousin Giulio. Their sister Maddalena, married to the former Pope Innocent VIII's son, Francescheto Cibo, was back with their two children; so was Lucrezia, married to Jacopo Salviati of the Florentine banking family, who owned the home of Dante's Beatrice; their aunt Nannina and her husband, Bernardo Rucellai; Piero and Alfonsina with their oldest son. They were dressed in their gayest brocades, jeweled satins and cut velvets.</p>

  <p class="normal">And Contessina was there, elegantly gowned in aquamarine silk interwoven with silver thread. Michelangelo noted with surprise that she was taller, that her arms and shoulders had filled out a little, and her bosom, propped by stays under the embroidery, was approaching maturity. Her eyes, when they met his, sparkled as brightly as the silver jewels with which her dress was ornamented.</p>

  <p class="normal">A servant handed him a glass of hot mulled wine. The drink, combined with the warmth of the reception, the sharp nostalgia the room evoked, and Contessina's bemused smile, all went to his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">Piero stood with his back to the fire. He smiled, and seemed to have forgotten their quarrel. "Michelangelo, it is our pleasure to welcome you back to the palace. Today we must do everything that pleases Giuliano."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I should like to help make Giuliano happy today."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good. The first thing he said this morning was, 'I should like to have the greatest snowman ever made.' And since you were our father's favorite sculptor, what would be more natural than that we should think of you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Something within him sank like a stone. While the Medici children turned their faces toward him, he remembered the two tubes in the cadaver that extended downward from the mouth, one to carry air, the other food. Should there not be a third, to swallow crushed hopes?</p>

  <p class="normal">"Please do it for me, Michelangelo," cried Giuliano. "It would be the most wonderful snowman ever made."</p>

  <p class="normal">His acrid impression of having been summoned as an entertainer passed with Giuliano's plea. Was he to reply, "Snow is not my trade?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do help us, Michelangelo." It was Contessina, who had come close to him. "We'll all serve as your assistants."</p>

  <p class="normal">And he knew it was all right.</p>

  <p class="normal">Late that afternoon, when the last of the Florentine crowds had thronged through the palace grounds to see the hilariously grotesque, giant snowman, Piero sat at his father's desk in the big office, under the maps of Italy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not move back into the palace, Michelangelo? We would like to bring together again my father's circle."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could I ask under what conditions I would return?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You would have the same privileges as when my father was alive."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gulped; he was fifteen when he had come to live in this palace. He was almost eighteen now. Hardly an age to receive spending money left on his washstand. Yet it was a chance to get out of the drear Buonarroti house, the nagging domination of Lodovico, to earn some money, perhaps to carve something good for the Medici.</p>

  <p class="chapter">7.</p>

  <p class="normal">A groom moved him back into his old apartment, with Bertoldo's sculptures still untouched on the catercornered shelves. A palace tailor came with fabrics and measuring tapes; and on the following Sunday Piero's secretary, Ser Bernardo da Bibbiena, deposited three gold florins on the washstand.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everything was the same; yet everything was different. The scholars of Italy and Europe no longer came to the palace. The Plato Academy preferred to hold its meetings in the Rucellai gardens. At Sunday dinner only those noble families with pleasure-loving sons were at table. The great families from the Italian city-states were not present on the pleasant duties of treaty making, nor were the merchant princes who had prospered with the Medici, nor yet the <i>gonfalonieri, buonuomini </i>or councilmen from the Florentine districts whom Lorenzo had kept close to him in bonds of intimacy. All these were replaced by entertainers and Piero's young sporting friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Topolinos rode into the city behind their white oxen on Sunday after mass and hoisted the Hercules block onto their cart. The grandfather drove, while the father, three sons and Michelangelo walked through the quiet streets that had been hosed and swept immaculately clean at sunrise, each holding an end of the lashing ropes. They drove in through the back entrance of the garden, unloaded and propped the marble next to his old sculpture shed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Comfortably settled, he returned to his drawings, made one in red chalk of the youth pulling apart the jaws of the Nemean lion with his bare hands; the man in his middle years wrestling Antaeus to death; the old man fighting the hundred-headed hydra; all of which he found too pictorial. Finally rejecting the outspread figure of earlier Florence Herculeses, the legs wide apart, arm on the hip, he designed a closed, compact figure closer to the Greek concept, in which all of Hercules' bursting power was held in a unifying force between torso and limbs.</p>

  <p class="normal">What concession must he make to the conventional? First, the huge club: this he designed as a tree trunk upon which Hercules leaned. The inevitable lion's pelt, which had always formed a frame for the figure, he knotted far out on one shoulder, letting the barest suggestion fall across the chest, concealing nothing of the heroic torso. He extended one arm only a little, patently enclosing the round firm apples of the Hesperides. The club, the long lion skin, the apples had been used by former sculptors to depict fortitude; his Hercules, naked before the world, would carry within its own structure everything that mankind needed of fortitude and resolution.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was not daunted by the fact that his would be the largest Hercules ever carved in Florence. As he marked out the proportions of the great figure, seven feet seven inches in height, with a foot-and-a-half base and five inches of safety marble above the head from which he would carve downward, he recalled that Hercules had been the national hero of Greece, as Lorenzo had been of Florence. Why then portray him in small, exquisite bronzes? Both Hercules and Lorenzo had failed, but oh! how much they had accomplished in the trying! How richly they deserved to be carved bigger than life.</p>

  <p class="normal">He built a rough clay model, working out the shifts of weight and stance, the movements of the back muscles because of the extended arm, the muscle distribution because the figure was leaning, the straining of tendon and ligament, the swivel of hip and shoulder, all of which he now knew and could project with conviction. Yet some instinct kept him from using measuring cords and iron pegs to enlarge the model to scale. For his first life-size figure in the round, which was also the first work he was creating in absolute independence, he wanted to see how far and faithfully his hand could follow his eye.</p>

  <p class="normal">He forged his tools for the initial massing, pounded the rods to increase their length, giving them a stubbier end to withstand the greater hammer blows, and once more, with the handling of the metal, achieved in himself a feeling of hardness, durability. He squatted on his haunches before the marble. Looking at the huge block gave him a sense of power. He removed the edges with heavy point and heavy hammer, thought with satisfaction that by this very act he was already adding to the stature of the block before him. He had no wish to conquer the nine-foot slab, only to persuade it to express his creative ideas.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was Seravezza marble, quarried high in the Apuan Alps. After he had penetrated its weathered outer skin it behaved like a lump of sugar under his dog's-tooth chisel, its pure milky-white slivers crumbling between his fingers. He used a flat stick to gauge approximately how deep he had to cut to get down to neck depth, armpit depth, torso depth, the bended knee. Then he went back to the forge, made a <i>calcagnolo, </i>and attacked the marble with fury, the chisel hugging close to the surface like a plow through the earth. And now the Seravezza marble suddenly became hard as iron, and he had to struggle with all his strength to achieve his forms.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ignoring the instructions of Bertoldo, he did not attempt to work his block all around, develop it as a whole, but went after the head, shoulders, arms, hips, using his flat stick and naked eye to measure his high points as he dug deeper. Then he almost ruined his block. He had cut too deeply to free the neck and head, and now his strong chisel strokes on the emerging shoulder muscles caused intense vibrations to run up through the neck into the head. The shivering marble looked for an instant as though it would crack at the narrow point; his Hercules would lose his head, and he would have to begin again on a reduced scale. Then the trembling ceased.</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat down on a nearby box to wipe the perspiration from his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">He forged new fine-edged tools, making sure every point was symmetrical. Now each blow of his hammer was transferred directly to the carving end of the tool, as though it were his fingers rather than the chisels that were cutting through the crystals. Every few moments he stepped back and circled the block because, no matter how deep he cut, a fog of texture obscured the contour of knee socket, rib cage. He used a brush to clear away the dust.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made a second series of mistakes; his eye failed to measure accurately the receding planes, and he delivered some hard blows which spoiled the frontal harmony. But he had left himself spare marble at the back, and so he was able to push the entire figure deeper into the block than he had intended.</p>

  <p class="normal">His progress became swifter as he stepped inside the marble, so passionately tearing out deepening layers that he felt as though he were standing in the midst of a snowstorm, breathing its flurries, closing his eyes at the moment of the hammer impact.</p>

  <p class="normal">The anatomy of the marble began matching the anatomy of his clay model: the powerful chest, magnificently rounded forearms, the thighs like the white meat under the bark of giant trees, the head focusing enormous power within its limited area. Hammer and chisel in hand, he stood back from the galvanic male figure before him, still faceless, standing on a rough-gouged base to show the material from which it had emerged, thinking that from the very beginning the marble had yielded to love: pliable, vulvar. With marble he was the dominant male; his was the choice, his the conquest. Yet coming together with the object of his love, he had been all tenderness. The block had been virginal but not frigid; it had been set on fire by his own white heat. Statues came out of the marble, but not until the tool had penetrated and seeded its female form. From love came all of life.</p>

  <p class="normal">He finished the surface with a good pumicing, but gave it no polish, afraid that to do so would diminish its virility. He left the hair and beard in a crude state, with just a suggestion of curls, angling the small three-toothed chisel so that he could dig in with the last tooth for accent.</p>

  <p class="normal">Monna Alessandra went to bed feeling tired one night, and never awoke. Lodovico took the loss hard; like most Tuscans, he was deeply attached to his mother, and had for her a gentleness he showed no one else in the family. For Michelangelo the loss was poignant; since the death of his own mother thirteen years before, Monna Alessandra had been the only woman to whom he could turn for love or understanding. Without his grandmother the Buonarroti house seemed gloomier to him than ever.</p>

  <p class="normal">The palace, by contrast, was in an uproar over Contessina's marriage, which was to take place late in May. Since Contessina was the last of the Medici daughters, Piero was ignoring all of the sumptuary laws and preparing to spend fifty thousand florins to give Florence the greatest celebration in its history. Contessina went her busy way, whirling from <i>sarta </i>to <i>sarta </i>for her gowns, commissioning dowry chests to be painted, interviewing merchants from all over the world to select her linens, brocades, jewelry, silver and goldware, dishes, blankets, furnishings that were her rightful and imperative dowry as a Medici.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then one evening they met by accident in the <i>studiolo. </i>It was so like old times, with Lorenzo's books and art works about them, that they forgot for the moment the impending ceremonies and linked arms affectionately.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I hardly see you any more, Michelangelo. You are not to be unhappy at my wedding."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Am I to be invited?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The wedding takes place here. How could you not attend?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The invitation must come from Piero."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Stop being difficult!" Her eyes flashed with the anger he remembered flaring up at his other obstinacies. "You will celebrate for three days, just as I will."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not quite," he replied; and they both blushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci was commissioned by Piero to take charge of the scenery for the wedding pageant, ball, banquet, theatricals. The palace was full of singing, dancing, drinking, revelry. Yet Michelangelo was lonely. He spent most of his time in the garden.</p>

  <p class="normal">Piero was polite but distant, as though having his father's sculptor under his roof was all he had been after. The feeling of being an exhibit was strengthened when he heard Piero boast that he had two extraordinary persons in the palace: Michelangelo, who made great snowmen, and a Spanish footman who ran so fast that Piero, riding his best horse at a gallop, could not outrun him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Excellency, could we speak seriously about my carving marbles? I wish to earn my keep."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was incredulity in Piero's expression.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A couple of years ago you were offended because I treated you as a tradesman. Now you are offended because I do not. How is one to keep you artists happy?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I need a goal such as your father outlined to me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What was that?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To build a fa√ßade for San Lorenzo, with niches for twenty life-size marble figures."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He never mentioned it to me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It was before he went out to Careggi the last time."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah well, the fleeting dreams of a dying man. Not very practical, are they? You just keep yourself busy as best you can, Buonarroti, and someday I'll think of something for you to do."</p>

  <p class="normal">He watched the wedding gifts roll in from all over Italy, Europe and the Near East, from Lorenzo's friends, from business associates of the Medici: rare jewels, carved ivories, perfumes, costly satins from Asia; goblets and bowls of gold from the Orient, carved furniture. He too wanted to give Contessina a gift. But what?</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hercules! Why not? He had bought the marble with his own money. He was a sculptor, he should give her sculpture for her wedding. The Hercules for the garden of the Ridolfi palace! He would not tell her about it, he would simply ask the Topolinos to help him move it there.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now for the first time he came to grips with Hercules' face. It would be a portrait of <i>Il Magnifico: </i>not of his upturned nose, muddy skin, scraggly hair; but of the inner man and mind of Lorenzo de' Medici. The expression would convey intense pride, coupled with humility. It would have not only the power but the desire to communicate. Matching the devastating strength of the body would be a gentleness that would yet convey the fighter. Who would do battle for mankind, be concerned with remolding man's treacherous world.</p>

  <p class="normal">His drawings finished, he started carving excitedly, using the hand drill to bring out the nostrils and ears, the profusion of hair falling about the face, the finest edged chisel to round the cheekbones, the hand-twirling bore to touch ever so lightly the eyes to achieve the clear, piercing communication with every soul who looked upon him. He worked from dawn to dark, not bothering to eat at midday, and falling into bed at night like a dead man.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci praised him for his completion of so complex a task, then added quietly:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Amico mio, </span></i><span>you can't give it to Contessina. It wouldn't be right."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's too... too big."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Hercules is too big?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, the gift. The Ridolfi might not think it proper."</p>

  <p class="normal">"For me to give Contessina a gift?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"So large a gift."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you speaking of size? Or value?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Both. You are not a Medici, nor a member of a ruling house of Tuscany. It might be considered in bad taste."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But it has no value. I couldn't sell it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It has value. You can sell it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"To whom?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Strozzi. For the courtyard of their new palace. I brought them here last Sunday. They authorized me to offer you a hundred large gold florins. It will enjoy a place of honor to the courtyard. It is your first sale!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Tears of frustration smarted behind his lids, but he was older now, he could blink them back.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Piero and my father are right: no matter how an artist may strive, he ends up as a hireling, with something to market."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no way to escape the excitement of the three thousand wedding guests pouring into the city and filling Florence's palaces to capacity. On the morning of May 24 he donned his green silk tunic with velvet sleeves, the violet cloak. In front of the palace was a fountain garlanded with fruits, to its center two figures designed by Granacci from which red and white wine flowed so abundantly that it ran down the Via de' Gori.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked with Granacci behind the wedding party as Contessina and Ridolfi paraded through streets decorated with flags, preceded by trumpeters. At the entrance to the Piazza del Duomo was a replica of a Roman triumphal arch festooned with garlands. On the steps of the cathedral a notary read aloud the marriage contract to the thousands who jammed the piazza. When Michelangelo heard the extent of Contessina's dowry, he blanched.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the family church of San Lorenzo, Piero formally presented Contessina to Ridolfi, who placed the betrothal ring on her finger. Michelangelo remained at the back of the church and slipped out a side door in the middle of the nuptial mass. A wooden stand filled one side of the square, to accommodate the crowds, while to the center there was a fifty-foot tree supporting a white pavilion to which musicians played. The surrounding houses were hung with tapestries.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wedding party emerged from the church, Ridolfi tall in his white satin cloak, jet-black hair framing his thin, pale face. Michelangelo stood on the steps watching Contessina in her crimson samite gown with its long train and collar of white ermine, on her head an elaborate headdress mounted on a crimson support and adorned with carved gilt beads. As soon as she was seated in the bedecked stands the entertainment began: a play depicting "A Fight Between Chastity and Marriage," a tournament in which Piero jousted; and as the climax, a contest of the "Knights of the She-Cat" in which a man, naked to the waist and with shaven head, entered a cage on a wooden platform where he had to kill a cat with his teeth, without using his hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">A seat had been reserved for him in the dining salon. The finest produce of Tuscany had been brought to the palace for the feast: eight hundred barrels of wine, a thousand pounds of flour, of meat, of game, of marzipan. He watched the ceremonial acts of a child being placed in Contessina's arms and a gold florin in her shoe to bring fertility and riches. Then, after the nuptial feast, when the guests went into the ballroom which Granacci had converted into ancient Bagdad, he left the palace and walked from piazza to piazza, where Piero had set up prodigal tables of food and wine for all of Florence to participate. But the people seemed glum.</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not return to the palace where there were to be two more days of feasting and celebration before Contessina would be escorted to the Ridolfi palace. Instead, in the dark of night, he walked slowly up to Settignano, spread an old blanket under the Topolino arches and, his hands locked behind his head, watched the sun emerge over the hills to light the roof of the Buonarroti house across the ravine.</p>

  <p class="chapter">8.</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina's marriage proved to be a turning point: for himself; for Florence. He had witnessed the resentment of the people on the first night of the feasts, heard the general murmurings against Piero. There was little need for the fiery sermons preached against him by Savonarola, returned to the city with more power than ever in his Dominican Order, demanding that Piero be prosecuted by the Signoria for violation of the city's sumptuary laws.</p>

  <p class="normal">Puzzled at the intensity of the reaction, Michelangelo went to visit Prior Bichiellini.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Were the marriages of the other Medici daughters less sumptuous?" he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not particularly. But with Lorenzo, the people of Florence felt he was sharing; with Piero, they felt he was giving. It made the wedding wine turn sour in their mouths."</p>

  <p class="normal">The' completion of Contessina's wedding celebration was a signal to the Medici cousins to begin their political campaign against Piero. Within a few days the city was awash with scandal: at a party the night before Piero and his cousin Lorenzo had fought over a young woman. Piero struck Lorenzo a blow on the ear; the first time one Medici had ever struck another. They had both pulled their knives and there would have been a killing if friends had not stepped in. When Michelangelo went in to midday dinner he found a few more of the older friends missing. The laughter of Piero and his comrades sounded a trifle hysterical.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci came into the garden at dusk to tell him that someone had seen his Hercules in the Strozzi courtyard, was waiting for him there, and would like to speak to him about a commission. Michelangelo hid his surprise when he found the new patrons to be the Medici cousins, Lorenzo and Giovanni. He had met them many times in the palace while Lorenzo was alive, for they had loved him as a father, and the Magnificent One had given them the highest of diplomatic posts, even sending them to France eleven years before to congratulate Charles VIII on ascending the throne. Piero had always condescended to them as coming down through the lesser branch of the family.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Medici cousins were standing on either side of his Hercules. Lorenzo, who was twelve years older than Michelangelo, had regular features full of expression, though his skin was pockmarked; he was a powerfully built man with a strong neck, shoulders and chest. He lived like a great lord in the family palace on Piazza San Marco, with villas on the declivity of the hill below Fiesole and at Castello. Even now Botticelli was living on his commission to illustrate Dante's <i>Divine Comedy. </i>He himself was a respected poet and dramatist. Giovanni, the younger brother, twenty-seven, was called "The Handsome" by Florentines.</p>

  <p class="normal">They greeted him heartily, spoke highly of the Hercules, then got to the point. Lorenzo was the spokesman.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, we saw the two marble pieces you sculptured for our uncle Lorenzo, and we have often said, my brother and I, that one day we should like you to carve a piece for us."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo remained silent. The younger brother continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We've always yearned for a young St. John. In white marble. As the patron saint of our home. Would the theme interest you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo shifted awkwardly from foot to foot, gazing out the main gate of the Strozzi palace to the intense pool of sunlight lying in the Via Tornabuoni. He needed work, not merely because of the money involved but because he was growing restless. It would put marble in his hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are prepared to pay a good price," said Lorenzo, while his brother added, "And there is a place at the back of our garden for a workshop. What do you say?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To be wanted is always good. May I think it over?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of course," replied Lorenzo heartily. "We have no desire to rush you. Give us the pleasure of your company at Sunday dinner."</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked home in silence, his head down. Granacci proffered no word or suggestion until they parted at the corner of the Via del Bentaccordi and Via dell'Anguillara.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was asked to bring you. I brought you. That does not mean that I necessarily think you should accept."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, Granacci. I understand."</p>

  <p class="normal">His family had no such tolerance.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of course you'll take the commission!" boomed Lodovico, pushing masses of his gray-black hair back out of his eyes. "Only this time you can dictate the fee because they came to you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why did they come to me?" persisted Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because they want a St. John," replied his aunt Cassandra.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But why at this moment, when they are setting up an opposition party to Piero? Why didn't they ask me at any time during the past two years?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What business is that of yours?" demanded his uncle Francesco. "Who is crazy enough to look a sculpture commission in the mouth?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"But something more is true, Uncle Francesco. Prior Bichiellini says the aim of the cousins is to drive Piero out of Florence. I think they want to strike another blow at Piero."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And you are a blow?" Lncrezia's face was puzzled.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A modest one, <i>madre mia." </i>Michelangelo's whimsical smile offset the ugliness of his flattened nose.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let's get out of politics," commanded Lodovico, "and back into business. Are times so good for the Buonarroti that you can afford to turn down a commission?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, Father, but I can't be disloyal to Lorenzo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The dead don't need loyalty."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They do. As much as the living. I just gave you the hundred florins from the Hercules."</p>

  <p class="normal">The cousins reserved him a place of honor at their festive Sunday dinner, spoke of everything but Piero and the St. John. When, after dinner, Michelangelo stammered that he appreciated their offer but could not at the moment accept, Lorenzo replied easily:</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are in no hurry. The offer stands."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no real place for him in the palace. He served no purpose and was valuable to no one except Giuliano, who needed the affection. He went looking for jobs to justify his presence: sorting Lorenzo's collection of drawings, adding Piero's occasional acquisition of an ancient medallion or carved gem to its proper place in the cabinets. Lodovico had told him that he did not have the price of pride; but sometimes a man's nature did not give him the choice of deciding whether he could afford a trait of character with which he had been born.</p>

  <p class="normal">Piero too was unhappy, sitting at table pale, cold, as he asked his few remaining friends:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why can't I get the Signoria to see things my way? Why do I have trouble with everything, when my father had life so smooth?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo posed the question to Prior Bichiellini, who sat back in his black tunic with the white shirt showing crisp and clean at the throat. His eyes snapped with anger.</p>

  <p class="normal">"His four Medici ancestors considered the <i>act </i>of governing as the <i>art </i>of governing. They loved Florence first, themselves second. Piero..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was surprised at the denunciatory edge to the prior's voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have not heard you bitter before, Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...Piero won't listen to counsel. A weak man at the helm, and a power-hungry priest working to replace him... These are sad days for Florence, my son."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have heard some of Savonarola's 'plank by plank' sermons on the coming Flood. Half the people of the city believe Judgment Day is the next rain away. What is his purpose in terrorizing Florence?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior took off his spectacles.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He wants to become Pope. But his ambition doesn't end there: he has plans to conquer the Near East, then the Orient."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo asked banteringly, "You have no passion for converting the heathen?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior was quiet for a moment "Would I like to see an all-Catholic world? Only if the world wished to be converted. And certainly not by a tyrant who would burn down the humanities and destroy the world's mind to save its soul. No true Christian would want that."</p>

  <p class="normal">At the palace he found an urgent message from his father. Lodovico led him into the boys' bedroom, lifted a pile of clothing from the top of Giovansimone's locker, and scooped out a pile of jewelry, gold and silver buckles, medallions.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What does this mean?" he asked Michelangelo. "Has Giovansimone been burglarizing people's homes at night?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nothing quite so illegal, Father. Giovansimone is a captain in Savonarola's Army of Boys. They strip women in the streets who violate the padre's orders against wearing jewelry in public; they knock on doors, twenty or thirty of them, if they hear of a family violating the sumptuary laws and strip it bare. If they meet opposition, they stone people half to death."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But is Giovansimone allowed to keep these things? They must be worth hundreds of florins."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He is supposed to bring them all to San Marco. Most of the children do. But Giovansimone has converted his old gang of hoodlums into what Savonarola calls his 'white-shirted angels.' The Council is powerless to stop them."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lionardo chose this time to summon Michelangelo to San Marco to show him the school for painters, sculptors and illuminators Fra Savonarola had set up in the cells off the cloister garden.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You see, Michelangelo. Savonarola is not against art, only obscene art. Now is your chance to join us and become the sculptor for our order. You'll never want for marble or commissions."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What will I sculpture?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What does it matter to you what you sculpture, as long as you are working?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who will tell me what to carve?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Fra Savonarola."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And if I don't want to carve what he wants?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"As a monk you will not question. You will have no personal desires...."</p>

  <p class="normal">He went back to his workbench in the abandoned casino. Here at least he was free to draw from memory anatomical pictures of the things he had learned during his months of dissection. He burned the crowded, overscrawled papers, yet it was hardly necessary since no one came to the garden any more except the fifteen-year-old Giuliano, who sometimes walked over, books under his arm, to study in companionable silence at Torrigiani's old worktable on the casino porch. They would walk back to the palace through the summer dusk that sifted downward like gray powder on the city, quenching the serene blue and golden-tan light of the building stones.</p>

  <p class="chapter">9.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the fall, Florence became embroiled in an international dispute that could lead to the city-state's destruction. It was all happening, Michelangelo gathered, because Charles VIII, King of France, had built the first permanent army since Caesar's legions, consisting of some twenty thousand trained and heavily armed men. He was now bringing that army across the Alps and into Italy to claim the Kingdom of Naples through inheritance. During Lorenzo's lifetime Charles VIII would have been too friendly to the Medici to threaten a march across Tuscany; if he had, Lorenzo's allies, the city-states of Milan, Venice, Genoa, Padua, Ferrara, would have closed ranks to keep him out. But Piero had lost these allies. The Duke of Milan had sent emissaries to Charles, inviting him to Italy. The Medici cousins, who had been at Versailles for his coronation, assured the king that Florence awaited his triumphal entry.</p>

  <p class="normal">Because of the alliance of the Orsini, his mother's and wife's family, with Naples, Piero refused Charles safe passage. Yet during the months from spring to autumn he did nothing to assemble soldiers or arms to stop the French king if he did invade. The citizens of Florence who would have fought for Lorenzo were ready to welcome the French because they would help drive out Piero. Savonarola too invited Charles to enter Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the middle of September Charles VIII had brought his army across the Alps, been welcomed by the Duke of Milan, and sacked the town of Rapallo. The news threw Florence into a fever. All normal business was suspended, yet when Charles again sent his emissaries to ask for safe passage, Piero turned them away without a definite answer. The French king vowed to storm through Tuscany and conquer the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo now had a new neighbor in the palace. Piero imported Alfonsina's brother, Paolo Orsini, to lead one hundred mercenaries... to stop Charles's army of twenty thousand. A dozen times Michelangelo vowed he would flee the palace, travel to Venice as Lorenzo had suggested. Loyal to Lorenzo, to Contessina, Giuliano, and even to Cardinal Giovanni, he had no feeling whatever for Piero, who had given him a home, a place to work and a salary. But he could not bring himself to join the deserters.</p>

  <p class="normal">His three years under Lorenzo in the garden and palace had been years of excitement, growth, learning, mastery of his tools and trade, every day a precious jewel to be valued, cherished; every day like a year of maturing. And now, for the better part of these last two and a half years since Lorenzo's death, he had been stopped in his tracks. He was a better draftsman, yes, thanks to Prior Bichiellini and his months of dissection, but he felt less alive, less knowledgeable, less creative than he had in the flush of his training by Bertoldo, <i>Il Magnifico, </i>Pico, Poliziano, Landino, Ficino, Benivieni. For a long time he had been traversing the bottom half of a circle. How did he get into an upward swing again? How did he rise above the tumult, fears, paralysis of Florence, start his mind and hands working again as a sculptor?</p>

  <p class="normal">How indeed, with even Poliziano going to Savonarola for absolution, begging in his last words to be taken into the Dominican Order so that he could be buried in a monk's habit inside the walls of San Marco?</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci would give him no council. Bugiardini said simply, "If you go to Venice, I go along." When Jacopo heard that Michelangelo was thinking of the journey he sought him out and cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I always wanted to see Venice. On somebody else's florins. Take me along. I will protect you on the road from assassins...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"By telling them jokes?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo screwed up his face, said, "Laughter is a lance. What do you say?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Agreed, Jacopo. When I leave for Venice, I'll take you with me."</p>

  <p class="normal">On September 21, Fra Savonarola, in a final effort to drive Piero out, preached a climactic sermon in the Duomo. Florentines jammed the cathedral. Never before had the friar had such power, and never had his voice rung out with such a clap of doom. The hair of the Florentines stood on end as they cried and lamented while Savonarola portrayed the destruction of Florence and every living creature in it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"'For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall die...'"</p>

  <p class="normal">The friar's faintest whisper pierced the remotest corners of the vast cathedral. Each stone served as a rebounding wall. Michelangelo, standing just inside the doors, felt closed in on every side by a sea of sound, drowning him like rising waters. He returned to the street surrounded by a mass of people half dead with fright, speechless, their eyes glassy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only Prior Bichiellini was calm.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But, Michelangelo, that is necromancy. From the darkest ages of man. God himself promised Noah and his sons, in Genesis 9:9-11, that there would never be a second Deluge: 'Here is a covenant I will observe with you and with your children after you.... Never more will the living creation be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again a flood to devastate the world.' Now tell me, by what right does Savonarola rewrite the Bible? One day Florence is going to find out it has been made a fool of...."</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior's soft voice dispelled Savonarola's spell.</p>

  <p class="normal">"At that time you can open the gates of Santo Spirito to him, to save him from the mob," suggested Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior smiled wryly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can't you imagine Savonarola taking the vow of silence? He'd sooner burn at the stake."</p>

  <p class="normal">The web closed tighter each day: Venice declared herself neutral, Rome declined to provide troops. Charles attacked the frontier fortresses of Tuscany, a few of them fell, Pietrasanta's marble quarrymen put up a good fight; but it could be only a few days before the French army entered Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had little opportunity for rational thought. Alternating hysterias of fear and relief swept the populace, with all of the city in the streets, summoned to the Piazza della Signoria by the ringing of the great bell in the tower, to hear the news. Was the city to be sacked? The Republic overthrown? Was the wealth, art, trade, security, prosperity to be gobbled up by an invading monarch with a powerful army, after Florence had lived at peace with the world for so long that it had no more army, weapons, no will to fight? Had the second Deluge begun?</p>

  <p class="normal">One morning Michelangelo rose to find the palace abandoned. Piero, Orsini and their staffs had rushed out to treat with Charles. Alfonsina had left with her children and Giuliano for refuge in a hillside villa. Aside from a few old servants, Michelangelo seemed alone. The magnificent palace was frightening in its hollow silence. Lorenzo's body had died in Careggi, and now the great spirit of the man, represented by his magnificent library and art works, seemed to be dying as well. As he walked the echoing corridors and looked into the big empty rooms, something of the dread odor of death pervaded them. He ought to know, he who had become an expert in the Santo Spirito dead room.</p>

  <p class="normal">Chaos continued. Piero prostrated himself before Charles, offered the conqueror the coast fortresses, Pisa and Leghorn and two hundred thousand florins if he "would continue down the coast and avoid Florence." Outraged at this humiliating capitulation, the City Council rang the bell on top of the Signoria, summoned the people, and castigated Piero for his "cowardice, foolishness, ineptitude, surrender."</p>

  <p class="normal">A delegation, including Fra Savonarola, was sent to Charles. It ignored Piero. Piero dashed back to Florence to reassert his rights. The city was wild in its rage against him. He demanded to be heard. The crowd yelled, "Go away! Do not disturb the Signoria!" Piero turned away in contempt. The crowd in the piazza wagged their hoods in denunciation, small gangs of boys hissed and threw stones. Piero drew his sword. The crowds chased him through the streets. He disappeared into the palace and diverted the throngs momentarily by having the remaining servants bring out wine and cake.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then couriers came down the street crying, "The Signoria has banished the Medici! For life! There is a price of four thousand florins on Piero's head. Down with Piero!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Entering the palace, Michelangelo found that Piero had escaped through the rear garden, joined Orsini's band of mercenaries at the Porta San Gallo and fled. Cardinal Giovanni, his fat face red with perspiration from the arm-load of manuscripts he was carrying, behind him two of his house servants also loaded down with fine bindings, was cutting through the garden and out the rear gate to safety. His apprehensive face lit up when he saw Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti! I've saved some of Father's rarest manuscripts, the ones he loved best."</p>

  <p class="normal">Florence was only a moment behind.</p>

  <p class="normal">Into the courtyard surged the mob. Cries of "The Medici are banished!" were followed with "Everything in the palace is ours!" Rioters poured down into the wine cellars, broke open bins, and when they could not edge out the corks, smashed the bottles against the walls. Hundreds of bottles and demijohns passed from hand to hand and mouth to mouth, were drunk from blindly in long untasting gurgles, the wine spilling so freely it flooded the cellar. Now, brutally, this first contingent mounted the stairs, passing those pressing their way down, to sack the palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood defensively before the Donatello David. The crowd still poured through the main gate, jamming the courtyard, individual faces that he had seen all his life on the streets and in the piazzas, quiet, good-natured people, suddenly inflamed, bent on destruction, with the faceless irresponsibility of the mob. What had caused the change? Was it the sense of being within the Medici palace for the first time as masters rather than outsiders?</p>

  <p class="normal">He was knocked very hard against the David and a lump was raised on his head. The Donatello Judith and Holofernes standing nearby was picked up base and all, and with a roar of approval carried out through the rear garden. What was too big to move, Roman portraits and marble busts, was shattered with smashes of pikes and poles.</p>

  <p class="normal">He edged along the wall, raced up the main staircase, ran at top speed down the corridor to the <i>studiolo, </i>slammed the door behind him, searched for the bolt. There was none. He looked about at the priceless manuscripts, cases of rare cameos, amulets, carved jewels, old coins, the Greek bas-reliefs above the door, the marble and bronze reliefs by Donatello, the painted wooden tables with Giotto's Deposition of Christ. Van Eyck's St. Jerome. What could be done to protect them?</p>

  <p class="normal">His eyes fell upon the dumbwaiter. He opened the door, pulled on the ropes and, when the lift was level, began piling in the small paintings, enameled and mosaic tablets, cups of jasper, sardonyx and amethyst, a small statue of Plato, a crystal clock mounted on gilt silver, glass vases by Ghirlandaio, manuscripts, rings and brooches. The old toothless Faun that he had copied for his own first piece of sculpture he stuffed inside his shirt. Then he pulled the opposite rope, sent the box down a way and closed the door. A mass of humanity reached the <i>studiolo </i>at that moment and began looting the room like locusts. He fought his way to his own apartment, where he threw Bertoldo's models and a few of the bronzes under the beds.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was the end of his usefulness. Hundreds of rioters were sweeping through the palace and into the great rooms, pilfering the family plate in the dining room, smashing the dishes and glassware, fighting and screaming with joy over the Medici collections of medals of gold and silver, taking from Piero's rooms his cups and trophies, throwing half-full bottles of wine at Pollaiuolo's Hercules and the Lion. In Lorenzo's room he watched helplessly as they grabbed up the four jasper vases with <i>Il Magnifico's </i>name inscribed, carried out the painted tables of Masaccio, Veneziano, cut paintings out of their frames, ripped sculptures off their bases, smashing the chairs and tables, what was too large to be moved, destroying chests. In the library, rare books and manuscripts had been pulled down from the shelves, the volumes trampled on.</p>

  <p class="normal">Were these Florentines revenging themselves on Piero? But these magnificent collections were not Piero's. Watching the men brutally rip velvet hangings and slash silk upholsteries, he shook his head in despair. "Who can look into the mind of a mob?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He recognized only one of the Medici faithful, his cousin Bernardo Rucellai, Nannina de' Medici's husband, standing before Botticelli's Pallas Subduing the Centaur in the anteroom adjoining a parlor. He was crying out:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are Florentine citizens! Why are you ravaging your own treasures? Stop, I implore you."</p>

  <p class="normal">To Michelangelo he appeared a heroic figure, his eyes blazing and arms outstretched to protect the canvas. Then Rucellai was knocked down. Michelangelo struggled to the prostrate form, picked the man up in his arms and carried him, bleeding, into a small storage room next door. He thought, ironically:</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is the most intimate contact I have had with my mother's side of the family."</p>

  <p class="normal">The palace was a shambles. Then, in Lorenzo's office, after tearing the maps and tapestries from the walls, some burly porters succeeded in smashing open the safe. Out came a rain of twenty thousand florins which sent the mob into a final paroxysm of joy as they fought each other for the gold coins.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made his way down the rear staircase and out through the garden, then through back alleys to the Ridolfi palace. He asked a groom for pen and ink, wrote Contessina a brief note: <i>When it is safe... send someone to your father's </i>studiolo.... <i>I loaded the food lift as full as I could. </i>He signed it <i>M.B.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">He made two stops on his way home: at Bugiardini's and Jacopo's, leaving word for them to meet him at the Porta San Gallo at midnight. When the city at last slept he slipped past the quiet houses to the Medici stables. Two of the grooms had stayed with the horses, keeping them quiet during the pandemonium around them. They knew that he had the right to take out horses whenever he desired. They helped him saddle up three. He rode one, led the other two.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no guard at the gate. Bugiardini was waiting, complacently standing in the dark cutting his long fingernails with a knife. Jacopo arrived shortly after. They started out for Venice.</p>

  <p class="chapter">10.</p>

  <p class="normal">By afternoon of the second day they had crossed the Apennines and dropped down out of the Futa Pass into Bologna, enclosed by orange brick walls, its turrets and almost two hundred towers, several of them leaning more crazily than the one at Pisa, puncturing the pellucid Emilian skies. They entered the city toward the river side, through the littered remains of a produce market which a bevy of old women in black were sweeping with brooms made of twigs tied to small branches. They asked one of the crones for a direction, and made for the Piazza Comunale.</p>

  <p class="normal">The narrow tortuous streets, covered over by the protruding second floor of the houses, were suffocatingly airless. Each Bolognese family had built a tower for protection against its neighbors, a Florentine custom that had been abolished by Cosimo, who had obliged the Florentines to saw off their towers at roof height. The wider streets and the piazzas were lined with arches of orange brick to protect the people from snow, rain and the intense summer heat, so that the Bolognese could traverse his town from any direction and never be exposed.</p>

  <p class="normal">They reached the main square with its majestic church of San Petronio at one end, and the Communal Palace covering an entire side; dismounted, and were promptly surrounded by Bolognese police.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are strangers in Bologna?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Florentines," Michelangelo replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your thumbs, if you please."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thumbs? What do you want with thumbs?'</p>

  <p class="normal">"To see the mark of the red wax."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We don't carry red wax."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you will have to come with us. You are under arrest."</p>

  <p class="normal">They were led to the customs office, a series of rooms buried behind porticoes, where the officer in charge explained that every stranger coming into Bologna had to register and be thumbprinted as he came through one of the city's sixteen gates.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How could we know?" demanded Michelangelo. "We've never been here before."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ignorance of the law excuses no one. You are fined fifty Bolognese pounds."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Fifty Bolognese... We don't have that much money."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Too bad. Fifty days in jail."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stared with openmouthed speechlessness at Bugiardini and Jacopo. Before they could recover their wits a man stepped forward.</p>

  <p class="normal">"May I speak with the young men, Officer?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Certainly, Excellency."</p>

  <p class="normal">To Michelangelo the man said, "Is not your name Buonarroti?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is not your father an officer of the Florentine customs?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Bolognese turned to the customs official.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Our young man here comes of a fine Florentine family, his father has charge of a branch of their customs office, as you have. Do you not think our two sister cities might exchange hospitality with its important families?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Flattered, the officer replied, "Assuredly, Excellency."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will guarantee their conduct."</p>

  <p class="normal">Back in the brittle winter sun of the piazza, Michelangelo studied his benefactor. He had a broad pleasant face, without a vestige of strain. Though a touch of gray indicated that he might be in his mid-forties, he had the smooth skin, high coloring and beardless face of a younger man, with small, perfect white teeth and small mouth held almost prisoner between a strong nose and chin. His brows came only halfway across his eyes from the bridge of his nose, then pointed upward quizzically. He was wearing a soft black wool robe with a white ruffled collar.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are most kind, and I am stupid: you remembered my unmemorable face, while I, though I knew we had met...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We sat next to each other at one of Lorenzo de' Medici's dinners," explained the man.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of course! You are Signor Aldovrandi. You were <i>podest√† </i>of Florence. You told me about the work of a great sculptor which is here in Bologna."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Jacopo della Quercia. Now I will have an opportunity to show it to you. Won't you and your friends give me the pleasure of your company at supper?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The pleasure will be ours," grinned Jacopo. "We haven't delighted our stomachs since we lost sight of the Duomo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you have come to the right city," replied Aldovrandi. "Bologna is known as <i>La Grassa, </i>The Fat. Here we eat better than anywhere in Europe."</p>

  <p class="normal">They left the piazza, walked to the north, with the church of San Pietro on their right, the connecting seminary on the left, then turned onto the Via Galliera. The Aldovrandi palace was number 8 on the left side of the street, a gracefully proportioned building of brick, three stories high. There was an ogive door framed by a colored terra-cotta frieze with the family coat of arms; the windows were arched and divided by marble columns.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bugiardini and Jacopo arranged the care of the horses while Aldovrandi took Michelangelo to see his wood-paneled library, of which he was enormously proud.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Lorenzo de' Medici helped me assemble the volumes."</p>

  <p class="normal">He had a copy of Poliziano's <i>Stanze per la Giostra </i>inscribed by Poliziano. Michelangelo picked up the leather-bound manuscript.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You know, Messer Aldovrandi, that Poliziano died a few weeks ago."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was heartbroken. For such a great mind not to exist any longer. And Pico too: on his deathbed. How bleak the world will be without them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Pico?" Michelangelo swallowed brine. "I did not know. But Pico is young...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thirty-one. When Lorenzo died it was the end of an era. Nothing will be the same again."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo held the poem in his hand, began reading aloud, hearing the voices of the Plato Four instructing him. Aldovrandi said with respect:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You read well, my young friend. Your diction is clear and you have a way of phrasing a line..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had good teachers."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You like to read aloud? I have all of the great poets: Dante, Petrarch, Pliny, Ovid."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had not thought I liked it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell me, Michelangelo, what brings you to Bologna?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi already knew about Piero's fate, for the Medici party had passed through Bologna the day before. Michelangelo explained that he was on his way to Venice.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How does it happen that you do not have fifty Bolognese pounds between the three of you if you are traveling so far?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bugiardini and Jacopo haven't a soldo. I'm paying the expenses."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi smiled. "I too should like to travel the world if you will pay my costs."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We hope to find work in Venice."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then why not remain in Bologna? There is Della Quercia to study from; we may even discover a sculpture commission for you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"After supper I will speak to my two companions."</p>

  <p class="normal">The brush with the Bolognese police had been enough to take the wanderlust out of Jacopo and Bugiardini. Neither were they interested in the sculpture of Della Quercia. They decided they would prefer to return to Florence. Michelangelo gave them the money for the journey and asked them to lead back his Medici horse. He then told Aldovrandi he would remain in Bologna and find lodgings.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Unthinkable!" replied Aldovrandi. "No friend and prot√©g√© of Lorenzo de' Medici may live in a Bolognese inn. A Florentine trained by the Plato Four is a rare treat for us. You will be our guest."</p>

  <p class="normal">He awakened to the orange Bolognese sun streaming into his room, lighting the tapestry behind him and the bright-colored boxed ceiling. In a painted coffer at the foot of the bed he found a linen towel, then washed himself in a silver bowl on a chest under the window, his naked feet warm on the Persian rug. He had been invited into a joyful house. He heard voices and laughter ringing through this wing of the palace which housed Aldovrandi's six sons. Signora Aldovrandi, an attractive young second wife who had contributed her quota of sons, was a pleasant woman who enjoyed all six of the boys equally, and welcomed Michelangelo as warmly as though he were a seventh son. His host, Gianfrancesco, belonged to the branch of the Aldovrandi which had split off from the ancient parental palace, applied itself to trade and money changing, and prospered so greatly that Gianfrancesco, graduated from the university as a notary, and an able banker in his younger years, was now free to spend his time in the arts. An enthusiast of poetry, he was also an able versifier in the vulgate. He had risen rapidly in the political life of the city-state: senator, <i>gonfaloniere </i>of justice, member of the ruling Sixteen Reformers of the Free State which governed Bologna, an intimate of the ruling Bentivoglio family.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is the one regret of my life that I cannot write in Greek and Latin," he told Michelangelo over a sweet bun and hot water flavored with spice as they sat at the end of the forty-place walnut dining table with its coat of arms inlaid in the center. "I read them, of course, but in my youth I spent too much time changing money instead of meters."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was an avid collector. He escorted Michelangelo through the palace to show him painted diptychs, carved wooden tablets, silver and gold bowls, coins, terra-cotta heads, ivories, bronzes and small carved marbles.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But no important local art, as you can see," he explained ruefully. "It is a mystery to me: why Florence and not Bologna? We are as rich a city as you, our people are as vigorous and courageous. We have a fine history in music, scholarship; but we have never been able to create great painting or sculpture. Why?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"With all respect, why are you called 'Bologna, the Fat'?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because we are gourmets, and have been famous since Petrarch's time for the pleasures of the flesh. We are a self-avowed carnal city."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could that be the answer?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That when all wants are satisfied there is no need for art? Yet Florence is rich, it lives well..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Medici, the Strozzi, a few families. Tuscans are lean by nature. And frugal. We don't derive pleasure from spending. I don't ever remember another family eating in our house; or our family eating with friends. I don't remember the Buonarroti giving or receiving a gift. We like to earn money, but not to spend it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And we Bolognese think money is made only to be spent. Our whole genius has gone into the refinement of our pleasures. Did you know that we have created an <i>amore bolognese? </i>That our women will not wear Italian patterns, but only French? That they must use several different materials in a single dress? That our sausages are so special, we guard the recipe as though it were a state secret?"</p>

  <p class="normal">At the midday dinner there was the full component of forty at the table: Aldovrandi's brothers and nephews, professors from the University of Bologna, reigning families from Ferrara and Ravenna passing through, princes of the Church, members of Bologna's ruling Sixteen. Aldovrandi was a charming host but, unlike Lorenzo, he made no effort to hold his guests together, to transact business or accomplish any purpose other than enjoyment of the superb fishes, sausages, meats, wines, storytelling and camaraderie.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the <i>riposo </i>Aldovrandi invited Michelangelo for a tour of the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">They walked under the arches where the shops displayed the most delicious foods of Italy: exquisite cheeses, the whitest of breads, rarest of wines, the rows of butcher shops in the Borgo Galliera displaying more meat than Michelangelo had seen in a year in Florence; then the Old Fish Market, with the sweet produce of the marshy valleys around Ferrara: sturgeon, crawfish, mullet. The hundreds of game sheds were selling the fruit of yesterday's hunt: roe deer, quail, hare, pheasant; and in every block of the city their world-famous <i>salame. </i>Everywhere Michelangelo passed students from the university, who did their studying at the little caf√©s under the orange-colored porticoes, playing dice and cards between pages of their assignments.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is one thing I miss, Messer Aldovrandi. I have seen no stone sculpture."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because we have no stone quarries. A simple equation, eh? But we have always brought in the best marble carvers who would come: Nicola Pisano, Andrea from Fiesole near you, Della Quercia from Siena, Dell'Arca from Bari. Our own sculpture is of terra cotta."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not until they reached Santa Maria della Vita, where Aldovrandi showed him Dell'Arca's Lamentation over the Dead Christ, that Michelangelo found himself excited. This large terra-cotta group was melodramatic and profoundly disquieting, for Dell'Arca had caught his people in fully expressed agony and lamentation.</p>

  <p class="normal">A few moments later they came upon a young man making terra-cotta busts to be placed above the capitals of the Palazzo Amorini in the Via Santo Stefano. He was powerfully built, with enormous shoulders and biceps, but with an egg-shaped head that was narrower at the top than at its base; his skin was burnt the precise orange of Bologna's brick. Aldovrandi called him Vincenzo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is my friend Buonarroti," he said, "the best young sculptor in Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, then it is proper that we meet," replied Vincenzo, "for I am Bologna's best young sculptor. I am Dell'Arca's successor. I am to finish the great Pisano tomb in San Domenico."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have received the commission?" asked Aldovrandi sharply.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not yet, Excellency, but it must come to me. After all, I am Bolognese. I am sculptor. What could be more natural?" He turned to Michelangelo. "If you need help in Bologna, I show you everything."</p>

  <p class="normal">As they walked on Aldovrandi said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Successor to Dell'Arca indeed! He is the successor to his grandfather and father, who are the finest brickmakers in Bologna. Let him stick to his trade."</p>

  <p class="normal">They made their way to the church of San Domenico, built in 1218 by the Dominican brothers. The interior had three naves, more ornate than most Florentine churches, with a sarcophagus of St. Dominic by Nicola Pisano to which Aldovrandi led him. He pointed out the marble carvings that had been done in 1267, and then the work that had been continued by Niccol√≤ dell'Arca.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Dell'Arca died eight months ago. There are three figures left to be sculptured: an angel here on the right, St. Petronius holding the model of the city of Bologna; and a St. Proculus. These are the marbles that Vincenzo said he was going to carve."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked hard at Aldovrandi. The man added nothing more, merely led him out of the church and to the Piazza Maggiore to see the work of Jacopo della Quercia over the main portal of San Petronio. He held back, letting Michelangelo go forward alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood transfixed, gasping in astonishment and delight. Aldovrandi came forward.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Did you know that Della Quercia competed for the bronze doors of the Baptistery in Florence? Back in 1400? Ghiberti beat him out. These five scenes on either side of the lateral supports, and the five above, are his answer to the rejection. Here in Bologna we think they are as good as Ghiberti's."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood before the stone panels shaking his head in disbelief. This could be the single greatest sculpture he had ever laid eyes on.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perhaps as good, perhaps better, certainly different," he replied. "Della Quercia was as much an innovator as Ghiberti. Look at how alive he makes his human figures, how they pulsate with inner vitality." Raising and lowering his arms, he indicated first one then another of the panels, exclaiming, "That carving of God. Of Adam and Eve. Of Cain and Abel. Of Noah drunk. Of the Expulsion from the Garden. See the strength and depth in the design. I'm stunned."</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned to his friend, added hoarsely,</p>

  <p class="normal">"Signor Aldovrandi, this is the kind of human figure I've dreamed of carving."</p>

  <p class="chapter">11.</p>

  <p class="normal">He found another excitement in Bologna, one he had not dreamed of.</p>

  <p class="normal">He went everywhere with Aldovrandi: to the palaces of the brothers for family dinner, to friends' for intimate suppers. The Bolognese were a naturally hospitable people who loved to entertain. It was at a supper given by Marco Aldovrandi, his host's nephew, that he met Clarissa Saffi, in Marco's villa in the hills where she was serving as his hostess. There were no other women present, just Marco's men friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was slender, golden-haired, the hair plucked back from the natural hairline of the brow in the fashion of the day. A lithe, willowy figure that moved with a delicate sensuousness; every slight rhythm of the arm and shoulder and leg as smooth as music, and as pleasurable. She appeared to be one of those rare creatures whose every breath was made for love. Sketching her figure in his mind, he found a wholeness here, an undulant softness of manner, voice, gesture, motion.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the beauty of neck and shoulder and bosom he thought of Botticelli's passion for the perfect female nude: not to love, but to paint. Clarissa had much of the golden loveliness of Simonetta, without the sad innocence Botticelli had given her.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was unlike any woman he had ever seen. He was aware of her not merely through his eyes but through every pore and part of his body. Her very presence in Marco's drawing room, before she moved or said a word, sent the blood pounding through his veins, shot his back and shoulders involuntarily upward, thrust his pelvic structure forward alive with new life. Jacopo would have cried as she passed the Duomo steps, "How mattressable!" but Clarissa, he perceived, was more than that. She was love in its ultimate female form.</p>

  <p class="normal">Clarissa's welcoming smile for him was embracing; she liked all men, had a natural affinity for them. Her movements had a captivating grace that was a delight to his senses. The long braids of burnished golden hair seemed to have the hot Italian sun on them, even in this cool room, and warmed him as thoroughly. Though an inner drum was pounding in his ears, he heard the soft, sibilant music of her voice that shocked him to intense awareness.</p>

  <p class="normal">She had been Marco's mistress for three years, since he had stumbled across her cleaning her father's cobbler shop. The first to recognize her beauty, be had set her up in a secluded villa, taught her how to wear rich gowns and jewels, had brought in a tutor to teach her to read and write.</p>

  <p class="normal">After supper, while the old friends were involved in a discussion of politics, Michelangelo and Clarissa found themselves alone in a little French music room. In spite of his protestations that he had no interest in the female form, that he found no excitement worthy of sculpturing, he could not tear his eyes away from Clarissa's bodice, clothed in a net of fine woven gold which accomplished the harrowing miracle of seeming to expose her breasts while at the same time keeping them under cover. The harder he looked, the less he could actually see: for he was confronted by a masterpiece of the dressmaker's art, designed to excite and intrigue, yet reveal nothing beyond a suspicion of white doves nestling.</p>

  <p class="normal">Clarissa was amused at his gaucherie.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are an artist, Buonarroti?"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was an effort to meet her gaze, for her eyes too were soft and rounded, now concealing, now revealing their intimacies.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am a sculptor."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could you carve me in marble?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're already carved," he blurted out. "Flawlessly!"</p>

  <p class="normal">A touch of color rode the high cheekbones of her slender, creamy cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">They laughed together, leaning a little toward each other. Marco had trained her well, and she spoke with a good inflection. Michelangelo was also aware of a quick and intuitive perception.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Will I see you again?" he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If Signor Aldovrandi brings you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not otherwise?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Her lips parted in a smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is it that you wish me to pose for you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. Yes. I don't know. I don't even know what I am saying, let alone what I mean."</p>

  <p class="normal">She laughed heartily. Her movements tightened the net over her bosom, and once again he found himself watching the lovely forms take discernible shape beneath the gold bodice. To himself he said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is <i>pazzesco, </i>crazy! What has happened to me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was his friend Aldovrandi who saw the naked longing in his eyes. He slapped him smartly on the shoulder and cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Well, Michelangelo, you have too much sense to get involved in our local political talk. We will have some music now. You knew that we are one of the great music centers of Europe?"</p>

  <p class="normal">On the way home, as they rode their horses side by side down the sleeping orange streets, Aldovrandi asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You were taken with Clarissa?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo saw that he could be honest, replied, "She makes my flesh crawl; I mean the flesh inside my flesh."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Our Bolognese beauties can do that. To cool you down a trifle, can you guess how expensive she is?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I see that her gowns and jewels are costly."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only the beginning: she also has an exquisite box of a palace, with servants, a stable of carriages..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Enough!" cried Michelangelo, with a wry grin. "But I have never seen a woman like her. If ever I was to carve a Venus..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't! My nephew has the quickest temper and rapier in Bologna."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night he writhed in fever. When he found himself turning and twisting in an effort to bury his face between her breasts he realized what had happened to him, but he was as incapable of stopping the burrowing in the soft warm pillows as he had been of stopping his search for them under the gold net.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next day he passed her in the Via Drapperie, the street of cloths and drapes, accompanied by an older woman. She was wearing a wreath of flowers through her hair and moved through the street with the same effortless magic under her silken gown with its gold belt encrusted with precious stones, woolen cape over her shoulders. She bowed, smiled slightly, and walked on, leaving him standing there rooted to the brick pavement.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night, when again he could not sleep, he went down to Aldovrandi's library, lit a lamp, took up his host's pen, and after many false starts, wrote:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent3"><i><span class="calibre9">The Garland and the Girdle</span></i></p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">What joy hath you glad wreath of flowers that is</p>

  <p class="versi">Around her golden hair so deftly twined,</p>

  <p class="versi">Each blossom pressing forward from behind,</p>

  <p class="versi">As though to be the first her brows to kiss!</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">The livelong day her dress hath perfect bliss,</p>

  <p class="versi">That now reveals her breast, now seems to bind:</p>

  <p class="versi">And that fair woven net of gold refined</p>

  <p class="versi">Rests on her cheek and throat in happiness!</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Yet still more blissful seems to me the band,</p>

  <p class="versi">Gilt at the tips, so sweetly doth it ring,</p>

  <p class="versi">And clasp the bosom that it serves to lace:</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Yea, and the belt, to such as understand,</p>

  <p class="versi">Bound round her waist, saith: Here I'd ever cling!</p>

  <p class="versi">What would my arms do in that girdle's place?</p>

  <p class="normal">He suspected that this was not exactly the kind of sonnet for which Benivieni had spent the hours training him. Yet the writing had, in Aldovrandi's expression, "cooled him down." He returned to his bedroom and slept.</p>

  <p class="normal">A few Sundays later Aldovrandi invited him for the evening to Clarissa's villa, where a group of Marco's intimates were gathering for their favorite game, <i>tarocchino di Bologna, </i>played with sixty oversized cards. Michelangelo knew nothing of such games, nor had he any money with which to gamble. After Clarissa had seen to it that Marco's friends were supplied with food and drink, she sat with Michelangelo before a crackling log fire in a side parlor with a handsome terracotta frieze. He watched her face in the firelight, the features so fragile, yet with such implicit passion.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's pleasant to have someone my own age to talk to," Clarissa confided. "All of Marco's friends are older."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You do not have young friends?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not any more. But I am happy. Is it not odd, Buonarroti, that a girl can grow up in utter poverty yet fit so naturally into all this elegance?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know, Madonna, you are out of my quarter."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Just what is your quarter? Beside sculpture, that is."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Poetry." He tendered her a wan smile. "You cost me two nights' sleep before I could get the sonnet down on paper."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You wrote a sonnet to me?" She was amazed. "It is the first. Could I hear it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He flushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think not. But I will bring a copy sometime. You can read it in privacy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why are you embarrassed? It is good to be desired. I accept it as a compliment."</p>

  <p class="normal">He cast his eyes down. How could he confess that he was as new at this game as he would have been at <i>tarocchino? </i>How could he acknowledge the fire burning in his loins?</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked up suddenly, found her eyes on him. She had read his feelings. She put her hand in his, studied his bashed-in face. These minutes of perception changed the relationship.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What fell on your nose, Michelangelo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"A ham."</p>

  <p class="normal">"From a butcher's rack? Did you forget to duck?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The way the people on Vesuvius forgot to run from the lava: it had covered them before they knew it was coming."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Have you ever been in love?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"... in a way."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's always 'in a way.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is love never whole?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not that I know of. It's political, like the marriage of Violante Bentivoglio to Pandolfo Malatesta in Rimini, in which your friend Aldovrandi headed the wedding party; or to get the children born and scrubbing done, as with the <i>contadini; </i>or for the pleasure of pearls and palace... as with myself...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Also what we feel for each other?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Her body stirred in its gown, causing a sibilance of the silk. Her fashionably shod foot rested lightly against his calf. His insides somersaulted.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are young people together. Why should we not want each other?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Again he thrashed the night through, his feverish body no longer content to nestle its face between her breasts; now he was pulsating to enter whole. He kept hearing her words over and over again in the darkness of his room while he throbbed with an unbearable urgency.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why should we not want each other?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He rose, went down to Aldovrandi's library, began writing scraps, phrases, lines, as they came tumbling into his head:</p>

  <p class="versi">Kind to the world, but to itself unkind,</p>

  <p class="versi">A worm is born, that, dying noiselessly,</p>

  <p class="versi">Despoils itself to clothe fair limbs, and be</p>

  <p class="versi">In its true worth by death alone divined.</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Oh, would that I might die, for her to find</p>

  <p class="versi">Raiment in my outworn mortality!</p>

  <p class="versi">That, changing like the snake, I might be free</p>

  <p class="versi">To cast the slough wherein I dwell confined!</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Nay, were it mine, that shaggy fleece that stays,</p>

  <p class="versi">Woven and wrought into a vestment fair.</p>

  <p class="versi">Around her beauteous bosom in such bliss!</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">All through the day she'd clasp me; would I were</p>

  <p class="versi">The shoes that bear her burden! When the ways</p>

  <p class="versi">Were wet with rain, her feet I then should kiss!</p>

  <p class="normal">It was during the Christmas festivities, with the symbolic "good wish" log burning in the drawing-room fireplace, and the poor children of the town singing carols outside for their gifts, with Signora Aldovrandi presiding over the annual appearance of the servants for the game of "fortune extracting" from a sack, that Michelangelo was rescued from his turmoil.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the servants had drunk their toasts and departed, and the Aldovrandi family, some thirty strong, had "extracted" their gifts, Aldovrandi turned to Michelangelo:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now you must try your fortune."</p>

  <p class="normal">He put his hand into the hemp bag. There was one package left. From the broad smiles all about him it was apparent that everyone was in on the joke. He pulled, and out came a terra-cotta replica of the Dell'Arca San Domenico tomb. In the three empty places, where the angel, St. Petronius and St. Proculus were missing, were oversized caricatures of himself, broken nose and all.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I... I have the commission?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi smiled at him happily. "The Council awarded it to you last week."</p>

  <p class="normal">When the guests had departed Aldovrandi and Michelangelo went into the library. Aldovrandi explained that he would send to Carrara for the marble when the drawings were ready and the dimensions established. Michelangelo was sure that his host had not only secured him this commission, which would pay him thirty gold ducats, but would be paying for the marble as well, and the haul over the Apennines by ox-cart. His heart was too full to know how to thank him. Impulsively he opened a copy of Dante, leafed through. He picked up a pen and at the top of the page, in the margin and below, quickly sketched scenes from Florence: the Duomo and Baptistery, the Palazzo della Signoria and the Ponte Vecchio over the Arno, stone Florence lying in the womb of its walls.</p>

  <p class="normal">"By your leave, each day I shall illustrate another page of Dante."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi stood over him, studying the rough-hatched pen sketches, his eyes shining.</p>

  <p class="normal">He went with Aldovrandi to Dell'Arca's workshop at the rear of San Petronio, part of an enclosed courtyard admitting to the vestment room of the church, partly covered by a portico, with workstalls for the maintenance crew similar to those in the Duomo, though smaller than the one in which he had worked his Hercules. The shop had been left untouched since Dell'Arca's sudden death some ten months before. On his workbench were his chisels, hammers, dried wax and clay improvisations, miniatures, folios of sketches for the remaining figures of the tomb, stubs of charcoal: a portrait of a man interrupted in the midst of life and work.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was cold in the raw January manner of Emilia, but two capacious braziers kept the open-faced shed warm. After two months of copying in the churches of Bologna, and drawing from the Della Quercias, he was desperately eager to get back to work: to the early modeling in clay, the firing of the forge and making of tools, the setting up of the marble on its wooden blocks and the first fastidious knocking off of the corners to begin searching for the figures in the round. It was half a year since he had finished the Hercules.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had been working only a few days, crouched over his drawing table, heavy wool hat covering his head and ears, when a massive shape loomed before him. He looked up, saw that it was Vincenzo, the terra-cotta sculptor. His face was a raw umber from the cold, his eyes were intense.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, you got the work I been after."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo remained silent for a moment, then murmured: "I'm sorry."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, you're not. You're a stranger. I'm Bolognese. You take bread out of the mouths of us native sculptors."</p>

  <p class="normal">Placatingly, Michelangelo replied, "I understand. I lost some carving at Santo Spirito last year to silver workers."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's good you understand. Go to the Council, tell them you decide against it. Then the commission comes to me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But, Vincenzo, if it hasn't come to you since Dell'Arca died...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Vincenzo brushed this aside with a sweep of his powerful brickmaker's arms.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You stole the commission with Aldovrandi influence. No one even knows you sculpt."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sympathized with the big fellow standing before him, sick with frustration.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll speak to Messer Aldovrandi."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You better. Or I make you sorry you came to Bologna."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Michelangelo told Aldovrandi of the encounter, he replied:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is true he is Bolognese. He watched Dell'Arca work. He knows what our people like. He has only one shortcoming: he can't carve marble. He should be making our fine Bolognese brick if he wishes to immortalize himself."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Shall I offer him a job as my assistant?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you need one?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm being a diplomat."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Be a sculptor instead. Forget him."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll never let you forget me," said Vincenzo the following day when Michelangelo reported that there was nothing he could do to help him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked at the enormous bony hands of Vincenzo, twice the size of his own. Vincenzo was his own age, about nineteen, but probably weighed twice as much as his own one hundred and twenty pounds, and loomed a head taller than his own five feet four inches. He thought of Torrigiani, could see Torrigiani's powerful fist coming through the air, hitting him, could taste the blood and feel the crushed bone. He became a little faint.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What's the matter, Buonarroti? You don't look good. Afraid I make life miserable for you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You already have."</p>

  <p class="normal">But no more miserable than he would be to have to relinquish the opportunity to carve three beautiful blocks of white Carrara marble. If this were the price...</p>

  <p class="chapter">12.</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not write to his family, nor did he receive letters from home, but once a week business associates of Aldovrandi made the trip over the Futa Pass to Florence. They took news of Michelangelo to the Buonarroti, and brought it back in turn.</p>

  <p class="normal">A week after Michelangelo had fled, Charles VIII had entered the city with his lance leveled to indicate that he was a conqueror, though no shots had been fired. He was welcomed through streets draped with tapestries and awnings and oil lamps. The Ponte Vecchio had been festively decorated; he was graciously received by the Signoria for prayers in the Duomo. He was given the Medici palace as his headquarters. But when it came to the peace treaty, Charles had acted haughtily, threatened to recall Piero, demanded an emperor's ransom. Fighting had broken out in the streets, French soldiers and Florentines had attacked each other, the Florentines had shut down their city and prepared to evict the French. Charles grew more reasonable, settled for a hundred and twenty thousand florins, the right to maintain two fortresses in Florence until his war with Naples was over, and took his army out of Florence. The city was proud of having faced up to the leader of twenty thousand armed soldiers, of having replied, when he threatened, "We shall sound our trumpets!" with "And we will ring our bells!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet the wheels of the city-state had creaked to a painful halt. Ruled for so long by the Medici, the governmental structure did not work without an executive. Former councilors had been Medici adherents who had developed a <i>modus vivendi </i>for working together. Now the city was torn by factions. One group wished to install the Venetian form of government; another wanted one Council of the People to pass the laws and elect magistrates, a second Council, smaller, of experienced men to establish domestic and international policy. Guidantonio Vespucci, spokesman for the wealthy nobles, called these measures dangerously democratic, fought to keep all power in a few hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">By mid-December news reached Bologna that Savonarola had stepped into the crisis with a series of Haggai sermons in which he backed the proposed democratic structure. Visitors to the Aldovrandi palace outlined the priest's concept of elected councils: only real property was to be taxed; every Florentine was to have a vote; all over twenty-nine years of age, who had paid their taxes, were to be eligible to the Grand Council. By the end of the sermons, Vespucci and his nobles had been defeated, Savonarola's plan had been adopted. From Bologna it appeared that Savonarola had become political as well as religious leader of Florence. His victory over <i>Il Magnifico </i>was complete.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the coming of the New Year, Piero de' Medici returned to Bologna to set up headquarters. Coming home from his workshop, Michelangelo found a group of Piero's professional soldiers in the street before the Aldovrandi palace. Piero was inside with Giuliano. Though Charles, when he made the peace with Florence, had insisted that the price on Piero's head and on Giuliano's be revoked, all Medici estates had been confiscated, and Piero himself banished to two hundred miles from the Tuscan border.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they met at the entrance to the dining room, Michelangelo exclaimed, "Excellency, how good to see you again. Though I could wish it were at the Medici palace."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We'll be back there soon enough," growled Piero. "The Signoria drove me out by force. I am assembling an army and shall drive them out by force."</p>

  <p class="normal">Giuliano, now grown as tall as Michelangelo, had bowed formally to Michelangelo, but when Piero took Signora Aldovrandi in to dinner, the two young men hugged each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was little pleasure at the usually gay Aldovrandi table, for Piero immediately outlined his plan for the re-conquest of Florence. All he required was sufficient money, hired mercenaries, weapons, horses. Piero expected Aldovrandi to contribute two thousand florins to his campaign.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Excellency, are you sure this is the best way?" asked Aldovrandi respectfully. "When your great-grandfather Cosimo was exiled he waited until the city found it needed him and called him back. Wait for that hour, Excellency."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am not as forgiving as my grandfather. Florence wants me back right now. It is just Savonarola and my cousins who have schemed against me."</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned to Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You shall enter my army as an engineer, help design the wall fortifications after we have conquered the city."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sat with his head bowed. "Would you wage war on Florence, Excellency?" he murmured after a moment.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I would, and I shall. As soon as I have a force strong enough to batter down the walls."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But if the city were bombarded it could be destroyed..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What then? Florence is a pile of stones. If we knock them down, we will put them together again."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But the art..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is art? We can replace all the paint and marble in a year. And it will be a Florence that I will command!"</p>

  <p class="normal">No one touched a bite of food. Aldovrandi turned to Piero. "In the name of my friend, <i>Il Magnifico, </i>I must decline. The money you ask for is yours, but not for purposes of war. Lorenzo would have been the first to stop you, were he alive."</p>

  <p class="normal">Piero turned to Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And you, Buonarroti?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I too, Excellency, must decline. I will serve you in any way you ask, but not to wage war against Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">Piero pushed his chair back, rose to his feet. "The kind of people I inherited from my father! Poliziano and Pico, who preferred dying to fighting. You, Aldovrandi, who were my father's <i>podest√† </i>of Florence. And you, Michelangelo, who have lived under our roof for four years. What kind of men are you that you will not fight back?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He swept out of the room. Michelangelo said with tears in his eyes: "Forgive me, Giuliano."</p>

  <p class="normal">Giuliano had also risen, turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I too shall refuse to wage war. That would only make Florence hate us the more. <i>A rivederci, </i>Michelangelo, I shall write Contessina that I have seen you."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was still skittish about angels. He remembered the first one he had done for the Ghirlandaio fresco, using the son of the carpenter downstairs of the Buonarroti house. The other apprentices had called him a fraud because he had cheated on the halo, making it fade into the background. What was an angel: male or female, human or divine? Prior Bichiellini had once called it "a spiritual being attendant on God." His embarrassment as he drew hundreds of angels was the more acute after his months of dissection. Now that he knew the tissue and function of human anatomy he could hardly refrain from using that knowledge. But did an angel have a twenty-five-foot snake of bowel? He must also carve his angel fully clothed to match the one on the other end of the Ark. With the angel and the two saints he was right back where Ghirlandaio had told him he would stay all his life: able to portray hands, feet, perhaps a little of the neck and throat. For the rest, all his hard-earned knowledge would be hidden under flowing robes.</p>

  <p class="normal">For his "spiritual being attendant on God," he chose a <i>contadino </i>boy, in from the farm with his family to attend church, looking a little like Bugiardini, with a wide, fleshy face but the features cut square in the Greek tradition. He had well-developed arms and shoulders, built by guiding a plow behind oxen. This powerful young male held high a candelabrum that would have required a giant to lift. Instead of compensating with delicate, diaphanous wings, as he knew he ought, he rubbed salt into the wound of his own befuddlement by designing the two wings of an eagle, about to take off, coming all the way down the boy's back. These he carved out of wood to attach to his clay model, wings so heavy they would have floored the delicate Dell'Arca angel on the opposite side.</p>

  <p class="normal">He invited Aldovrandi to visit the workshed. Aldovrandi was not at all upset by the vigor of the model.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We Bolognese are not spiritual beings. Carve a lusty angel."</p>

  <p class="normal">And so he did, setting up the thickest of Aldovrandi's three Carrara blocks. He felt complete again with the hammer and chisel in his hands, the dry caking marble dust in his nostrils, the white chips and powder covering his hair and clothes. When he worked stone he was a man of substance. Now he did not need the braziers, for he created his own warmth, moving the workbench out into the open courtyard when there was any winter sun, to feel the space around him.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the evenings, after he had read aloud to Aldovrandi and illustrated a page of Dante, he would do his exploratory drawing for the St. Petronius, patron saint of Bologna, convert to Christianity from a noble Roman family, and builder of San Petronio. He used as his models the older guests in the Aldovrandi palace: members of the Sixteen, professors from the university, justices, sketching their faces and figures in his mind while he sat with them at table, then retiring to his room to hammer down on paper the lines, forms, interrelation of feature and expression that makes every human being different from another.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was little he could do with St. Petronius that could be original. The Dominicans of San Domenico and the Bolognese government officials were set on what they wanted: St. Petronius must be no less than sixty. He must be fully gowned in luxuriant robes, an archbishop's crown on his head. He must hold in his arms a model of the city of Bologna with its towers and palaces piled high above its protecting walls.</p>

  <p class="normal">He acquired a neighbor in the stall opposite. It was Vincenzo, whose father had secured a contract for making new brick and tile for a cathedral repair job. A crew of mechanics came in to fill the stalls for the repairs, and the enclosed courtyard rang with the noise of materials being unloaded. Vincenzo afforded the workyard running entertainment by taunting Michelangelo throughout the workday.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Our brick lasts for a thousand years. It's harder than your Florentine stone."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's true you make durable brick, Vincenzo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't patronize me," said Vincenzo. "You Florentines think you are the only artists in Italy."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo blushed. Vincenzo cried to the workmen, "Look at his face. I caught him out."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Vincenzo arrived with a wagonload of fresh tiles, he badgered Michelangelo with: "I made a hundred durable stones yesterday. What did you make? Charcoal scratches on a paper?" Encouraged by the laughter of his townsmen, the brickmaker continued, "That makes you a sculptor? Why don't you go home and leave Bologna to its natives?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I intend to, when I have finished my three pieces."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nothing can hurt my brick. Think how easy it's going to be for an accident to happen to one of your statues."</p>

  <p class="normal">The workmen stopped in their tasks. Silence filled the yard. Vincenzo, who made words much as he did brick, with shaping movements of his hands, continued with a crafty smile:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Somebody brushes too close to the Ark. Smasho! Your angel is in a dozen pieces."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt anger rise in his throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You wouldn't dare!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, no, Buonarroti, not I. I am too graceful. But someone clumsy might stumble."</p>

  <p class="normal">The laughter of the workmen as they picked up their tools made him a little ill: the forces of destruction always one short step behind creation! He suffered through the days and weeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">St. Petronius emerged with a sad and deeply furrowed face; but there was inherent power in the body. The set of the head on the shoulders, the gripping strength of the feet in the thin-soled sandals, the puissant stance of the knees, hips, shoulders under the rich robe, the arms in which he firmly held Bologna, this vigor he could convey. As a craftsman he knew he had done a good job. It was as a creative artist that he felt he had contributed little.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is very fine," said Aldovrandi when he saw the polished piece. "Dell'Arca could not have surpassed it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I am determined to give you something more," said Michelangelo doggedly. "I must not leave Bologna without carving something exciting and original."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Very well, you disciplined yourself to give us the St. Petronius we wanted. I will discipline Bologna to accept the St. Proculus that you want."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bologna the Fat became Bologna the Lean for him. He did not return home for the big midday dinner. When an Aldovrandi groom brought him hot food he let it grow cold if it was not a moment when he wanted to stop. Now that spring was approaching he was able to work longer each day, and frequently did not reach the Aldovrandi palace until after dark, dirty, sweaty, charcoal- or chip-covered, ready to fall into bed of exhaustion. But the Aldovrandi servants brought him a big wooden tub filled with hot water, and laid out his clean clothes. He knew he was expected to join his patron in the library for a few hours of companionable talk.</p>

  <p class="normal">Clarissa he saw rarely, since he was attending few parties. But when he did see her the delight and the torment racked him for nights, obliterating his sleep and permeating his mind for days while he tried to create the figure of St. Proculus, and drew instead Clarissa nude under her silks.</p>

  <p class="normal">He preferred not to see her. It was too painful.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the first of May, Aldovrandi told him he might not work. This was the happiest day in the year for Bologna, when the Countess of Love reigned, people gathered wild flowers in the country for their relatives and friends, romantic young courtiers planted leafy trees with colored silk ribbons under the windows of their beloved while their friends serenaded her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo accompanied the Aldovrandi outside the main gate of town where a platform had been erected, covered with damask and festoons of flowers. Here the Countess of Love was crowned, with all Bologna gathered to pay homage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo too wanted to pay homage to love, or whatever it was that had been started boiling in his blood by the intoxicating air of the wild spring morning, the fragrance of the thousands of blossoms, the perfumes of the Bolognese women, beautiful on this ritual day, gowned in silks and jewels.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he did not see Clarissa. He saw Marco in the midst of his family with two young maidens, apparently the family choices for marriage, hanging on either arm. He saw the older woman who had accompanied her on her shopping trips to the city, saw her maid and several other of the servants picnicking in the fields beyond the platform where the ceremonies took place. But no Clarissa. Search as he might.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then he found he was no longer before the May platform, or in the celebrating Bolognese crowds. His feet were carrying him swiftly up the road to Clarissa's villa. He did not know what he would do when he got there. What he would say, how he would explain when someone opened the gate to him. Trembling all over, he half walked, half ran up the foothill road.</p>

  <p class="normal">The front gate was unbolted. He went to the front door, pushed on the clapper, knocked again and again. Just as he was beginning to think that no one was at home, and that he had acted stupidly, the door was opened a crack. There stood Clarissa, in a peignoir, her golden hair hanging loosely down her back, almost to her knees, without cosmetics or jewels, smelling aseptically of soap; and her face, to Michelangelo, more beautiful, her whole body more desirable because it was unornamented.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stepped inside the door. There was no sound in the house. She threw the bolt. Then they were in a passionate embrace, their bodies merging, knee and crotch, breasts and chest, their mouths moist and sweet and glued and drinking deep, their arms with all the power of an unquenchable life force crushing each to the other in a total pulsating time- and place- and sense-annihilating embrace.</p>

  <p class="normal">She led him to her bedroom. She had nothing on beneath the robe. The slender body, the red pointed breasts, the golden Mount of Venus were as his draftsman's eye had known them all along: a female beauty, made for love.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was like penetrating deep into white marble with the pounding live thrust of his chisel beating upward through the warm living marble with one "Go!", his whole body behind the heavy hammer, penetrating through ever deeper and deeper furrows of soft yielding living substance until he had reached the explosive climax, and all of his fluid strength, love, passion, desire had been poured into the nascent form, and the marble block, made to love the hand of the true sculptor, had responded, giving of its inner heat and substance and fluid form, until at last the sculptor and the marble had totally coalesced, so deeply penetrating and infusing each other that they had become one, marble and man an organic unity, each fulfilling the other in the greatest act of art and of love known to the human species.</p>

  <p class="normal">After May Day he completed the drawing of his virile St. Proculus, who had been martyred before the gates of Bologna in 303, while in the full flower of his youth and strength. He clothed him in a belted tunic which did nothing to conceal the vigorous torso and hips and bare legs. It was anatomically true and convincing. As he made his clay model his experience with the Hercules bore fruit, for he was able to achieve the corded, driving thighs, the bulging stamina-packed calves: truly the torso and legs of a heroic warrior and deliverer, powerful, indestructible.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, quite unabashedly, he modeled his own portrait from a mirror of his bedroom: the punched-in bridge of the nose, the flat spread of the cheekbones and wide spread of the eyes, the thatch of hair worn halfway down his forehead, the steadfast gaze, resolved to triumph: against the enemies of Bologna? The enemies of art? Of life? Was it not all the same?</p>

  <p class="normal">Carving in marble, feeling the blow of his chisel, Vincenzo was blotted out, the orange-earth figure and the heavy sound of his voice. With his eyes slitted against the flying chips, with the emergence of form from the block, he again felt himself to be fifteen feet tall. Vincenzo began to shrink in size, then fade; until finally he stopped coming to the courtyard.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the early afternoon sun made it too hot to work in the enclosed courtyard, he took crayon and paper to the front of the church, sat on the cool stone before Della Quercia's carvings and each day refreshed himself by copying a different figure: God, Noah, Adam, Eve, trying to capture some part of Della Quercia's power of imparting emotion, drama, conflict and reality through his half-released Istrian stone figures.</p>

  <p class="normal">The hot summer months passed in fulfillment: up before first light, working the marble by dawn, carving for six hours before he ate from his basket of cold sliced <i>salame </i>and bread. At night when the light had begun to hide the planes and surfaces of the figure, he would drape it in moist cloth, put it back in his shed, lock the doors securely behind him; walk to the wide, shallow Reno River for a cool soak and swim, then to the Aldovrandis', watching the stars be born in the deep blue canopy of the Emilian plain.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vincenzo had disappeared, and so had Clarissa. He learned from a passing remark of Aldovrandi's that Marco had taken her to his hunting lodge in the Apennines for the hot summer months. The Aldovrandi family too departed for their summer villa in the mountains. For most of July and all of August, Bologna was shut down as though decimated by the plague, its shops locked behind iron, roll-down shutters. He stayed alone in the palace with a pair of servants who considered themselves too old to travel, and saw his host only when Aldovrandi rode in for a day to take care of his affairs, his face tanned by the mountain sun. Once he brought startling news from Florence. His short, quizzical eyebrows pointed almost vertically as he exclaimed:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your Fra Savonarola has come out into the open. He has declared war on the Pope!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You mean the way Lorenzo did when Rome excommunicated Florence?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, no. This is personal and punitive."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi read from a report of Savonarola's latest Duomo sermon: "When you see a head which is healthy, you can say that the body is healthy also; but when the head is bad, look out for the body. And so when the head of the administration happens to be ambitious, lustful, and in other ways vicious, be sure that the scourge is near.... When you see therefore that God allows the head of the Church to wallow in crime and simony, then I say that the scourge of the people approaches...."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was not as shocked as Aldovrandi expected, for Prior Bichiellini had predicted long ago that the Pope was Savonarola's ultimate target.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How has the Pope replied?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He summoned Savonarola to Rome to explain his divine revelations. But Savonarola has declined, declaring, 'All good and wise citizens judge that my departure from this place would be to the great detriment of the people, yet of little use to you in Rome.... Because of the furtherance of this work I am quite sure these difficulties in the way of my going spring from God's will. Therefore it is not the will of God that I should leave this place at present.'" Aldovrandi chuckled. "An infallible system, don't you think?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo too declined to leave "this place" when Aldovrandi suggested he spend a cool holiday in the mountains with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, but I'm moving along rapidly with the St. Proculus. At this rate I shall finish by fall."</p>

  <p class="normal">The summer was over, Bologna rolled up its shutters and became a living city. Fall set in, and the St. Proculus was finished. Michelangelo and Aldovrandi stood before the figure. Michelangelo ran his hand caressingly over the high polish. He was exhausted, but happy with it. So was Aldovrandi.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will ask the fathers to set an unveiling date. Perhaps during the Christmas holidays?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was silent; it was the sculptor's job to carve and the patron's to unveil.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We could honor you in San Domenico."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My work is done, and I have grown homesick for Florence," said Michelangelo quietly. "You have been a good friend."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aldovrandi smiled. "For a year of bed and board I have extracted from you countless hours of reading poetry, and an illustrated copy of <i>The Divine Comedy! </i>What Aldovrandi ever drove a shrewder bargain?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He could not go without saying good-by to Clarissa. That took a little waiting. Finally Aldovrandi invited him to a party at a secluded villa in the hills where the wealthy young Bolognese felt free to bring their mistresses for feasting and dancing. Michelangelo saw that there would be no chance for even a moment of privacy in a quiet library or music room. They would have to say good-by in the middle of a drawing room surrounded by twenty couples; and on their faces they would have to wear the bantering Bolognese smile which meant that charming pleasantries were being exchanged.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have watted to say good-by, Clarissa. I am going back to Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">Her eyebrows came together for a moment, but the fixed smile never wavered.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm sorry. It has been pleasant to know you were here."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Pleasant? A torture, pleasant?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In a way. When will you return?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know. Perhaps never."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Everyone returns to Bologna. It's on the road to everywhere."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then I'll be back."</p>

  <p class="chapter">13.</p>

  <p class="normal">The family was genuinely glad to have him home, kissing him on both cheeks and exclaiming at his stubble of beard. Lodovico was delighted with the twenty-five ducats Michelangelo brought him. Buonarroto seemed to have grown a full foot; Sigismondo, no longer a child, was apprenticed to the Wine Guild; and Giovansimone had left the house entirely, maintaining himself regally in a flat across the Arno as one of the leaders in Savonarola's Army of Boys.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He does not come home any more," sighed Lodovico; "we ask too many embarrassing questions."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci was working in deadly earnest from first light to dark at Ghirlandaio's in an effort to keep the <i>bottega </i>afloat. When Michelangelo visited the studio he saw the cartoons being drawn for the new frescoes for the chapel of San Zanobi by David and Benedetto Ghirlandaio, by Mainardi, Bugiardini, Tedesco. They seemed well done.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes," agreed David, "but always we face the same criticism: 'With Domenico dead, the studio is finished.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We work twice as hard as before," sighed Mainardi, "but none of us has Domenico's genius. Except his son Ridolfo here; but he's only twelve, it will be ten years before he can take his father's place."</p>

  <p class="normal">On the walk home Granacci reported, "The Popolano family wants you to sculpture something for them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Popolano? I don't know any Popolanos."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, you do." Granacci's usually bland voice had an edge to it. "It's the Medici cousins, Lorenzo and Giovanni. They have changed their names to coincide with the People's party, and are now helping to rule Florence. They asked me to bring you around when you returned."</p>

  <p class="normal">The brothers Lorenzo and Giovanni Popolano received him in a drawing room filled with precious art works from Lorenzo's palace. Michelangelo glanced from a Botticelli to a Gozzoli to a Donatello stupefied.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We did not steal them," said Giovanni easily; "the city auctioned them off in public sale. We bought them."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sat down, uninvited. Granacci came to the defense of the cousins.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This way the paintings and sculptures are safe. Some of the best pieces are being sold outside Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo rose to his feet. "I was taken by surprise... so many memories flooded over me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Giovanni Popolano ordered sweet wine and cake. Lorenzo then said they were still interested in having a young St. John. If he cared to move into the palace, for convenience' sake, he would be welcome.</p>

  <p class="normal">That evening when all the bells of the city were ringing loud enough to remind him of the Tuscan adage, "Bells ring to summon others, but never go to church themselves," he crisscrossed the narrow streets of the city to the Ridolfi palace. He had been shaved and had his hair cut by Torrigiani's barber in the Straw Market; had bathed and donned his best blue woolen shirt and stockings for the visit.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Ridolfi had been members of the <i>Bigi, </i>or Gray party, which had been pardoned by the Council for being followers of the Medici, and were now ostensibly members of the <i>Frateschi, </i>or Republicans. Contessina received him in the drawing room, still attended by her old nurse. She was heavy with child.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Contessina. <i>Come va?"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"You said I would bear many sons."</p>

  <p class="normal">He gazed at her pale cheeks, burning eyes, the upturned nose of her father. And he remembered Clarissa, felt her standing in this room beside Contessina. "All love is 'in a way.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have come to tell you that your cousins have offered me a commission. I could not join Piero's army, but I want no other disloyalty on my conscience."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I heard of their interest. You proved your loyalty, Michelangelo, when they first made the offer. There is no need for you to continue demonstrations. If you wish to accept, do so."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall."</p>

  <p class="normal">"As for Piero... at the moment my sister and I live under the protection of our husbands' families. If Piero ever attacks with a strong force, and the city is in real danger, who knows what will happen to us?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The major change had taken place in the city itself. As he walked the familiar streets he felt an air of hostility and suspicion. Florentines who had lived at peace with each other since Cosimo de' Medici had ordered their defense towers cut down to roof level had now split into three antagonistic party factions, shouting imprecations at each other. He learned to recognize them by their symbols. The <i>Arrabbiati, </i>or Maddened, were the men of wealth and experience who now hated Piero and Savonarola both, calling the friar's followers Snivelers and Prayer-mumblers. Next he distinguished the Whites, or <i>Frateschi, </i>which included the Popolanos, who liked Savonarola no better than the Maddened, but had to support him because he was on the side of popular government. Lastly there was Piero de' Medici's group, the Grays, who were intriguing for Piero's return.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he met Granacci in the Piazza della Signoria, Michelangelo was shocked to see Donatello's bronze Judith, which had been stolen out of the Medici courtyard, standing in front of the Signoria, and the David from the Medici courtyard installed in the Signoria courtyard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is the Judith doing here?" he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"She's now the reigning goddess of Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Stolen by the city. And the David too?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Harsh words, my friend. Confiscated."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What does that plaque say?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That citizens placed this statue here <i>as a warning to all who should think to tyrannize over Florence. </i>Judith with that sword in her hand is us, the valiant citizens of Florence. Holofernes, about to have his head cut off, represents the party one doesn't belong to."</p>

  <p class="normal">"So that a lot of heads will be rolling in the piazza? Are we at war with ourselves?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci did not answer; but Prior Bichiellini said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am afraid so."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sat in his study surrounded by the shelves of leather-bound manuscripts and the desk piled high with records and sheets of an essay the prior was writing. The prior folded his hands into his black Augustinian sleeves to warm them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have achieved some reform in taxes and morals. We have a more democratic government, more people can participate. But the government is paralyzed unless Fra Savonarola approves its acts."</p>

  <p class="normal">With the exception of the dedicated group at Ghirlandaio's studio, art and artists had vanished in Florence. Rosselli had fallen ill, and his studio was not working. Two of the Della Robbia family, who had inherited Luca's sculpture processes, had become priests. Botticelli would paint only subjects which his mind could shape from Savonarola's sermons. Lorenzo di Credi, trained by Verrocchio, was reduced to restoring Fra Angelico and Uccello, and had entered a monastery.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I thought of you," observed the prior, "when the friar announced a sermon for artists. I have some notes I jotted down... accurately, I assure you: 'In what does beauty consist? In color? No. In form? No! God is beauty itself. Young artists go about saying of this woman or man, Here is a Magdalene, here a Virgin, there a St. John; and then ye paint their faces in the churches, a great profanation of divine things. Ye artists do very ill, ye fill the churches with vain things....'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've heard it all from my brother. But if Savonarola prevails..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He prevails."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...then perhaps I should not have returned. What place is there for me here?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where would you go, my son?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was silent. Where indeed?</p>

  <p class="normal">On New Year's Day of 1496 a large group of men converged on the monastery in Piazza San Marco carrying lighted torches and chanting:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Burn down his house! Burn down San Marco! Burn down this dirty fellow of a friar!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood quietly in the shadow of the Popolano palace. The San Marco monks came out in their habits and cowls, stood shoulder to shoulder in a line across the front of the church and monastery, arms linked in a solid phalanx. The crowd continued to shout imprecations against Savonarola, but the monks stolidly held their ground; and after a time the torch carriers began to drift out of the piazza, their fires vanishing down the half dozen streets facing into the square.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leaning against the cold stone wall, Michelangelo felt a chill sweep through him. Into his mind came Donatello's Judith, standing with sword raised, ready to cut off... whose head? Savonarola's? Prior Bichiellini's? Piero's? Florence's?</p>

  <p class="normal">His own?</p>

  <p class="chapter">14.</p>

  <p class="normal">He went to see Beppe in the Duomo workyard and heard of a small, quite good piece of marble in a neighboring yard which he could buy at a reasonable price. The rest of the money advanced to him for the St. John he turned over to Lodovico.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could not bring himself to live in the renamed "Popolano palace," but he did set up his workbench in the garden. The cousins treated him as a friend, frequently inviting him inside, work clothes and all, to see a new piece of art or illuminated manuscript. At home there were only three in the boys' bedroom now, but since Buonarroto had volunteered to share with Sigismondo, Michelangelo was able to continue in the luxury to which he had grown accustomed: a bed to himself. The weather was cold and he ate and drank nothing until midday, so he brought home a substantial appetite which kept Lucrezia happy. Even Lodovico seemed pleased with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Popolano garden was formal, enclosed by a high protecting wall, with a covered three-sided porch under which he worked for warmth. Yet he could find little joy, and no creative surge. He kept asking himself, "Why?"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a sympathetic subject: young St. John setting out for the desert to preach in the wilderness, "a garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle about his loins, and locusts and wild honey were his food." Florence had many St. Johns: Andrea Pisano's St. John Baptizing on the Baptistery door, Ghiberti's bronze statue at Orsanmichele. Donatello's marble on the Campanile, Ghirlandaio's fresco in Santa Maria Novella, Verrocchio's Baptism of Christ painted for San Salvi with the assistance of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he read his Bible, Michelangelo gathered that John would have been fifteen years old when he set out for the desert, Palestine, to preach to the Samaritans. Most of the representations showed him as a small boy, slight in figure, with a childlike face. But that did not need to be. At fifteen many Italian youths were already men. Why could not the young St. John be a robust, healthy, hearty creature, well equipped to endure the rigors to which he was about to expose himself? The kind of figure he found it exciting to carve?</p>

  <p class="normal">Was it the anxious confusion of the city that depleted his enthusiasm, that caused him concern about his place in his own home? The stories going the rounds included all manner of fantastic rumors and fears: Savonarola would rule the city completely. Florence, having refused to join an Italian City-State League, frightened that the League would put Piero back in power, was again in danger of being conquered. Venice, the Duke of Sforza in Milan, the Borgia Pope in Rome, finding Piero a convenient ally against Savonarola, had helped Piero accumulate ten thousand ducats for the hiring of troops.</p>

  <p class="normal">But art had been threatened before. Artists had worked in a troubled world. In truth would there ever again be any other kind?</p>

  <p class="normal">Or was the difficulty of his approach to the St. John the old disturbing question, the elusiveness of John's meaning? Why should God have had to send someone to prepare the world for Jesus? Since he had God's capacity to set aside the laws of nature and perform miracles with which to convince the skeptical, why would the ground have to be plowed in advance for him?</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's mind was an inquiring one. He needed to know the reasons behind things; the motivating philosophic principles. He read the story of John in Matthew:</p>

  <p class="normal">"In those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea; Repent, he said, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. It was of him that the prophet Isaiah spoke, when he said, There is a voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, straighten out his paths."</p>

  <p class="normal">But the boy of fifteen first going out to preach was not the older man who later baptized Jesus. What was he like then? What was his importance to Christianity? Was his story imperative, or was it merely a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy, because the first Christians felt that the more strongly they based their religion on the Old Testament the better chance it would have to survive?</p>

  <p class="normal">If he was not a trained theologian, he was a good craftsman. He spent weeks sketching throughout the city, every youth he could detain for a few moments. Though he was not intending to create a massive John, neither would he have anything to do with the fragile, elegant St. John with which Florence was adorned. And so he designed, and then carved into the block, the suppleness of limb of a fifteen-year-old, using only the loincloth as a cover. He refused to carve a halo for the boy or give him the traditional tall cross to carry, as Donatello had, since he did not think that the young John carried a cross that many years before the cross came into Christ's life. It turned out to be a vital portrait of a youth; but when he finished polishing the piece, he still did not know what he meant by it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Medici cousins needed less meaning. They were well pleased, placing the statue in a protective niche in the far garden wall where it could be seen from the rear windows of the palace. They paid him the balance of the florins and told him he was welcome to continue using their garden as his workshop.</p>

  <p class="normal">But not a word about another commission.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nor can I blame them," Michelangelo commented to Granacci with a melancholy air. "It is nothing very special."</p>

  <p class="normal">A despair enveloped him. "I've learned to carve in the round; but when do I carve something extraordinary in the round? I feel that I know less now, with my twenty-first birthday coming, than I did at seventeen. How can that be possible?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It isn't."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Bertoldo told me, 'Create a body of work.' I have carved six pieces in these four years: the Hercules, the wood Crucifixion, the Angel, St. Petronius and St. Proculus in Bologna, and now this St. John. But only the St. Proculus has something original in it."</p>

  <p class="normal">On his birthday he walked disconsolately into the workshop in the Popolano garden. He found a block of white marble sitting on his workbench. Across it, scrawled in charcoal in Granacci's handwriting, was the greeting:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Try again!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He did, immediately, without sketching or going into wax or clay, an infant that had half formulated itself in his mind while he was slogging away at the St. John: robust, lusty, pagan, carved in the Roman tradition. He never imagined he was doing a serious piece, it was an exercise really, something he got fun out of, an antidote to the confusions and tensions of the St. John. And so the marble flowed freely, and out of the block emerged a delightful child of six, sleeping with his right arm under his head, his legs spread comfortably apart</p>

  <p class="normal">The piece took him only a few weeks to carve and polish; he was neither attempting perfection nor hopeful of selling it. The whole project was a lark, designed to cheer him up; and now that it was finished he intended to return the marble to Granacci with a note which would read:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only a little the worse for wear."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Lorenzo Popolano who changed his mind. When he saw the completed piece his face flushed with pleasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If you were to treat it so that it seemed to have been buried in the earth, I would send it to Rome, and it would pass for an antique Cupid. Would you know how to do that?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think so. I antiqued a whole folio of drawings once."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You would sell it for a far better price. I have a shrewd dealer there, Baldassare del Milanese. He will handle it."</p>

  <p class="normal">He had seen enough Greek and Roman statues to know how his marble should look. He worked first with the scraps left from the Bambino, rubbing the dirt of the garden into the crystals with his fingers, then sandpapering lightly before applying another layer, staining the outside edges heavily with earth tans and rust, using a hard bristle brush to bury the discoloration.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was satisfied that he had a good process, he began on the Bambino, working carefully, as amused at the idea of the impending fraud as he had been at the carving itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lorenzo liked the result.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is convincing. Baldassare will get you a good price. I have packets going to Rome in a few days, and I'll include your little statue."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lorenzo had guessed rightly: the Bambino was sold to the first customer to whom Baldassare offered it: Cardinal Riario di San Giorgio, grand-nephew of Pope Sixtus IV. Lorenzo poured a pouch of gold florins into Michelangelo's hands, thirty of them. Michelangelo had thought an antique Cupid in Rome would bring at least a hundred florins. Even so, it was twice what it would have brought in Florence; if indeed anyone would have wanted it, with Savonarola's Army of Boys forcibly sequestering all such pagan images from private homes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Just before Lent Michelangelo saw his brother Giovansimone hurrying down the Via Larga at the head of a group of white-robed boys, their arms laden with mirrors, gowns of silk and satin, oil paintings, statuary, jewel boxes. Michelangelo grabbed his brother, almost toppling his load of loot.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Giovansimone! I have been home for four months and haven't laid eyes on you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Giovansimone shook his arm loose with a broad grin, exclaimed:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Haven't time to talk to you now. Be sure to be in the Piazza della Signoria tomorrow at dusk."</p>

  <p class="normal">It would not have been possible for Michelangelo or anyone else in Florence to miss the giant spectacle the following evening. In the four main quarters of Florence the Army of Boys in their white robes were shaped into military formations and, preceded by drummers, pipers and mace bearers carrying olive branches in their hands and chanting, "Long live Christ, the King of Florence! Long live Mary, the Queen!" they marched on the Piazza della Signoria. Here, in front of the tower, a huge tree had been erected. Built around it was a pyramidal scaffold. The citizens of Florence and the outlying villages poured into the square. The section for the burning was roped off by the monks of San Marco standing arm in arm, with Savonarola in commanding position.</p>

  <p class="normal">The boys built their pyre. At the base they threw bundles of false hair, rouge pots, perfumes, mirrors, bolts of silk from France, boxes of beads, earrings, bracelets, fancy buttons. Then came all the paraphernalia of gambling, a shower of playing cards dancing for a moment in the air, dice and checkered boards with their pawns and characters.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the next layer of the pyramid were piled books, leather-bound manuscripts, hundreds of drawings, oil paintings, every piece of ancient sculpture the boys had been able to lay their hands on. Thrown onto the highest tier were violas, lutes and barrel organs, their beautiful shapes and glistening woods converting the mad heap to a scene of bacchanalia; then came masks, costumes from pageants, carved ivories and oriental art works; rings, brooches, necklaces sparkled as they landed. Michelangelo recognized Botticelli as he ran up to the pyre and threw onto it sketches of Simonetta. Fra Bartolommeo followed with his studies, the Della Robbia monks, with frenzied motion, added their varicolored terracotta sculptures. It was difficult to tell from the alternating outbursts of the crowd whether they greeted the sacrifices with fear or ecstasy.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the balcony of the tower stood the members of the Signoria watching the spectacle. The Army of Boys had gone from house to house asking for "all art works inappropriate to the faith," all ornaments, fineries and decorations not permitted by the sumptuary laws; if they had not been given what they considered a sufficient contribution, they had brushed past the owners of the house and looted it. The Signoria had done nothing to protect the city against these "white-robed angels."</p>

  <p class="normal">Savonarola raised his arms for silence. The guarding line of monks unlocked their arms and raised them to the heavens. A monk appeared with a lighted torch and handed it to Savonarola. Savonarola held the torch high while he gazed around the square. Then he walked around the pyre, touching it in one place after another until the entire scaffolding was one huge mass of flames.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Army of Boys marched about the burning pyre chanting, "Long live Christ! Long live the Virgin!" Great answering shouts went up from the packed mass. "Long live Christ! Long live the Virgin!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Tears came to Michelangelo's eyes. He wiped them away as a child would, first with the back of his left hand and then with his right. But they continued to well up, as the flames mounted higher and higher and the wild singing and crying reached an ever greater crescendo, until they rolled down his cheeks and he felt their saltiness on his lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wished with all his heart that he could go away, as far from the sight of the Duomo as he could get.</p>

  <p class="chapter">15.</p>

  <p class="normal">In June a groom came with a message from Giovanni Popolano asking Michelangelo if he would come to the palace to meet a Roman nobleman interested in sculpture. Leo Baglioni, the Popolanos' guest, was a man of about thirty, blond, well spoken. He walked with Michelangelo out to the workshop.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My hosts tell me you are an excellent sculptor. Could I see something of your work?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have nothing here, only the St. John in the garden."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And drawings? I am particularly interested in drawings."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you are a rarity among connoisseurs, sir. I should welcome your seeing my folio."</p>

  <p class="normal">Leo Baglioni pored over the hundreds of sketches.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you be so kind as to make a simple drawing for me? A child's hand, for example."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo drew rapidly, a number of memories of children in various poses. After a time Baglioni said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"There can be no question about it. You are the one."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The one?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. Who carved the Cupid."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Forgive me for dissembling, but I was sent to Florence by my principal, Cardinal Riario di San Giorgio, to see if I could find the sculptor of the Cupid."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It was I. Baldassare del Milanese sent me thirty florins for the piece."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thirty! But the cardinal paid two hundred..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Two hundred! Why, that... that thief..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Precisely what the cardinal said," declared Leo Baglioni with a mischievous gleam in his eye. "He suspected it was a fraud. Why not return to Rome with me? You can settle your account with Baldassare. I believe the cardinal would be pleased to offer you hospitality. He said that anyone who could make such an excellent fake should be able to make even better authentic carvings."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo shook his head in perplexity over the series of events; but there was no faltering in his decision.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A few articles of clothing from my home, sir, and I shall be ready for the journey."</p>
