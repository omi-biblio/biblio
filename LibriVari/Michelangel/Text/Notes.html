  <h1>NOTE</h1>

  <p class="normal">This biographical novel is documented by several years of living and researching in the source materials of Florence, Rome, Carrara and Bologna. The work actually began six years ago when I had the entire body of Michelangelo's four hundred and ninety-five letters, as well as his records and art contracts (Milanesi edition, Florence, 1875), translated into English, a task not before attempted, by Dr. Charles Speroni, professor of Italian at the University of California at Los Angeles, to create a solid base for the novel. A considerable amount of material is here published for the first time. The sources are now on record at the library of the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>

  <p class="normal">I am deeply indebted to the scholars in the Renaissance field. The late, great Bernard Berenson afforded me expert counseling on the Michelangelo bibliography, and opened his magnificent library at I Tatti, in his own words, "night or day." Ludwig Goldscheider, the British authority, gave warmheartedly of his precious time and materials. Aldo Fortuna, the Florentine archivist, shared his lifetime of Renaissance documentation. Cardinal Tisserant made available the superb Michelangelo collection in the Vatican Library. Professor Giovanni Poggi unlocked the Buonarroti family record books, which go back many years before Michelangelo's birth. Dr. Ulrich Middledorf, director of Der Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, facilitated our work in his library, as did the directors of the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">In Carrara, I am grateful to Bruno and Mario Taverelli for the opportunity to study the quarries at close range, and for their indefatigable efforts to document the Carrarino dialect and mores. In Bologna, I am indebted to Professor Umberto Beseghi for leading me to the best of the Bolognese source materials; in Siena, I am grateful to the descendants of Vittoria Colonna, Marchesa Pace Misciatelli and Donna Ginevra Bonelli, for helping me with the story of the Marchesa di Pescara. Stanley Lewis, the Canadian sculptor, was my guide in Florence to Michelangelo's techniques; there he also taught me to carve marble. He has answered an unending stream of questions about the thinking and feeling of the sculptor at work. Charles and Carmela Speroni corrected manuscript and galleys, as a labor of love.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lastly, I want to acknowledge my considerable indebtedness to Charles de Tolnay, whose monumental five volumes constitute the definitive art history on Michelangelo's work. Michelangelo's sonnets are quoted from the J. A. Symonds translation. The quotation from Ovid's <i>The Metamorphoses </i>is from the Horace Gregory version. Quotations from Dante's <i>The Divine Comedy </i>are from the Lawrence Grant White translation.</p>
