      <h1 class="CTT"><b>“A Miserable Death Threat”</b></h1>

      <p class="CO">The gold hoard and the ivory treasure found during the spring of 1937 turned out to be the high point of Loud’s four seasons of excavation, in terms of glittering items that would catch the public’s imagination. However, his final seasons proved to be just as important to the overall aims and goals of the expedition. It was now that they were able to finish digging all the way down to bedrock in Area BB—their east dig—and to complete their reconstruction of the entire occupational sequence of Megiddo, from the earliest indications of inhabitation in Stratum XX to the final abandonment of the mound after Stratum I.</p>

      <p class="TX">Along the way, though, in these final seasons, they had to deal with the dangers that came with living in British Mandate Palestine during the Arab Revolt, which had begun with the general strike in 1936 and was now entering its final and most violent phase. For the team at Megiddo, this included a death threat against Loud, the attempted assassination of their good friend Iliffe, and the murder of an archaeological colleague who was en route to the opening of the Palestine Archaeological Museum.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">But all of this still lay in the not-too-distant future, and they knew none of it when Loud and the others—the Altmans and Shipton—all left together from New York in mid-November 1937, heading once again for Megiddo.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-1" id="chapter14_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Their exciting discoveries during the spring had guaranteed them another season. In fact, even though Wilson had been pessimistic at first, unexpected returns from investments had already allowed him to budget $25,000 for 1937–38 back at the end of February, even before all of the gold and ivory treasures began to come to light. Even though it was $3,000 less than they had just had for the 1936–37 season, it would still be enough for another year of digging, given the skeleton staff at the site.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-2" id="chapter14_2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="262" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_262" role="doc-pagebreak" title="262"></span>There was also a new member of the team with them—a young Harvard-trained architect named George Preston Frazer, known to all simply as “Preston.” He had been hired to serve as the new architectural assistant. However, this turned out to be his only season at Megiddo, because he was subsequently offered a job as an assistant professor of art at Virginia Tech and taught there for his entire career—from 1939 to 1974, with a break to serve with the Second Armored Division during World War II. He had volunteered to join the Megiddo staff after Loud, back at the end of the last digging season, sent a letter of inquiry to Harvard University asking for interested applicants, and was now happily on board with the others as their ship steamed out of New York harbor.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-3" id="chapter14_3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">They reached Haifa on the afternoon of 25 November. Despite spending what seemed like an eternity getting their belongings through customs, they were at the Megiddo dig house in time to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner with Parker, who had arrived ten days earlier. The following day, Loud sent a letter to the director of antiquities, alerting him that they were back and asking whether they could once again renew their license to dig for the coming year.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-4" id="chapter14_4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The reply came back positive, of course, and they began digging again in early December, supervising 160 local men and boys by themselves for nearly a week before the Egyptian workmen arrived for the season. Once again they were digging in the north and east areas, but initially it was a season more of destruction than of exploration, for they were removing the palace in the one area and what they were calling the “East Temple” (now Temple 2048) in the other: “demolishing our best architectural specimens,” as Loud put it, in order to see what lay below.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-5" id="chapter14_5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Soon thereafter, Olof Lind stopped by, twice in a single week, to see how things were going and to reach an arrangement about some items that he had left behind at the dig house. It was the first time they had seen him in more than a year; he was far friendlier than he had been at the time that they had all parted ways. In the interim, he had bought an orchard located half an hour south of Haifa and was busy tending to fruit trees, for he was now a “citrus export agent” for the Pan Arab Corporation of London and the proud owner of five thousand apple trees and another five thousand plum, peach, pear, and assorted other trees.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-6" id="chapter14_6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">By mid-December, Loud told Wilson that he hoped “cablegrams announcing stupendous finds will be keeping Western Union busy” soon, but it was not to be. Instead, as he told Matthews at about the same time, <span aria-label="263" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_263" role="doc-pagebreak" title="263"></span>“Two weeks of digging leave us minus most of the architecture we so carefully dug out last season but with few objects.” By the end of December, the temple in the east area was gone, but they were still pulling the palace apart in the north, “piece by piece.” Loud reported sadly that it was presently “about as dull on the dig as any day could be.” His only consolation lay in remembering that the previous season had started off just as bereft of finds before they literally struck gold.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-7" id="chapter14_7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Loud later had little to say about what they found underneath the Strata VIII–VII palace. He noted only that they were in Middle Bronze Age levels there, looking at possible Hyksos-period remains, and that their findings confirmed the stratigraphic sequence that they had determined from the east area.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-8" id="chapter14_8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">However, he did say that they were also clearing an area in which stables had been previously exposed, and were removing one of them so that they could dig deeper in this region.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-9" id="chapter14_9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Although he does not specify a precise location, a bit of detective work reveals that this stable (5082) was the westernmost of five within the northern stables on the mound, which Guy had originally found back in 1928. The easternmost (407) of these five stables had already been removed during Guy’s seasons, while the middle three were excavated by the Tel Aviv Expedition from 1998 to 2007, but during this season and the next, Loud’s men removed this one stable in order to see what lay beneath.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-10" id="chapter14_10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In addition, they were continuing to work in the area of the various city gates. They had found the Middle Bronze Age city gate belonging to Stratum XIII, which lay directly underneath the palace that they had just destroyed, and finished excavating the city gate that belonged to the period of the palace itself.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-11" id="chapter14_11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">They also opened a new area, which was called “K-10” at first, after the grid square in which they put the initial trench. It was at first only eight meters long (and presumably five meters wide, as usual), but was soon expanded and eventually became their Area DD. It was located east of the Stratum III and IV gates—that is, between their north and east areas—and was intended to connect Schumacher’s original Great Trench with their own excavations in the gate area (i.e., Area AA).<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-12" id="chapter14_12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In this new area they went down through the upper levels quickly until they reached “the best VII walls we have ever encountered with the exception of the palace.” Loud noted that this was a promising area for the future if they were looking for more remains dating to what he called “the Egyptian <span aria-label="264" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_264" role="doc-pagebreak" title="264"></span>levels.” Removing these in turn, they reached Stratum XIII in that area too and were poised to go farther below in the next season.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-13" id="chapter14_13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Toward the end of December, Wilson sent a coded cable with good news, just in time to make it a Christmas present for the team. The International Education Board of New York had just given him a $50,000 donation toward the excavations at Megiddo. This entity had formerly been associated with the Rockefeller Foundation but was now going out of business and was looking to disburse their remaining capital. Even though the General Education Board and the Rockefeller Foundation had said they wouldn’t fund the Oriental Institute any longer, this third entity was not bound by that decision for some reason, and so an agreement was reached with them to fund Megiddo for two additional seasons at $25,000 each.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-14" id="chapter14_14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">This gift was all Wilson’s doing—he had sent a letter to the board in early November, extolling the magnificence of the ivory and gold treasures that the team had found and including two multipage articles that Loud had published in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. He pointed out the tragedy of having lost the funding for the Megiddo expedition just as it was reaching “fruitful” levels, and therefore requested money to cover the $50,000 cost for two further seasons, to be conducted in 1938–39 and 1939–40, and another $12,500 toward publication of their results. He ended with the estimate that it would cost a total of $62,500 “to fight the battle of Armageddon.” Within a month, the board had voted to award them $50,000—enough money to cover the two additional digging seasons, but not publication.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-15" id="chapter14_15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Therefore, to all of Loud’s gloomy talk about the dearth of finds, Wilson replied that he personally was unconcerned, particularly now that they had enough funding to see them through the spring of 1940, and could properly wrap up what would be a total of fifteen years of work at the site. Besides which, as he quite wisely said, “even negative information about a site … is an addition to our knowledge.… We will get more objects in the future. There is no pressure upon you to get some every month or even every season.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-16" id="chapter14_16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The team celebrated with a nice Christmas dinner, together with Robert and Linda Braidwood, a pair of University of Chicago archaeologists who had shown up at the dig house unexpectedly, accompanied by their architect Carl Haines. The Braidwoods would later go on to rank among the most famous archaeological couples of all time, but at this point they were just getting started, were recently married (as of 1937), and were digging at Tell Tayinat in Syria, as part of the master plan that Breasted had <span aria-label="265" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_265" role="doc-pagebreak" title="265"></span>put into place several years earlier. Haines would also go on to prominence later, in particular as the field director for the Nippur expedition to Iraq beginning in the late 1940s.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-17" id="chapter14_17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">In the meantime, Howard Matthews, who by now had taken Charles Breasted’s place as the executive secretary of the Oriental Institute, was making plans to visit Megiddo in March 1938, as part of a larger tour of the Middle East that Wilson had asked him to undertake. It would be the first such official visit from an Oriental Institute administrator since both Breasted and Wilson had come through two and a half years previously, just before Breasted’s sudden death.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-18" id="chapter14_18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Writing in mid-December, Loud hastened to assure Wilson that it was safe for Matthews to come visit them, despite the recent reports that were appearing in the media both in British Mandate Palestine and back home. As he put it, “Our local press tells of bombs, shootings, and mischief going on not far away, but as far as we are concerned they do not exist.” This is actually similar to situations often found on digs today, for life on an excavation can be like living in a bubble, essentially unaffected by events taking place even fairly close by, especially if one does not venture away from the excavation. As Loud put it, “A curfew along the railroad track closes our road to Haifa during the night, but as we stay home evenings anyway it doesn’t bother us any.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-19" id="chapter14_19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Moreover, as he said a few days later, their own area remained quiet, although more than forty bandits had recently been killed in the region of Tiberias during a combined attack of police, air force, and troops, with the rest of the large gang rounded up. He also advised Matthews not to get too alarmed about what he read in the newspapers concerning the conditions in British Mandate Palestine. It was true, he said, “there is a lot of lawlessness,” but “with reasonable precaution it can be avoided.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-20" id="chapter14_20" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">However, things soon began to change for the worse. In early January, James Starkey, the excavator of Lachish, was murdered while on his way to Jerusalem to have dinner with Iliffe and attend the preview before the official opening of the Palestine Archaeological Museum.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-21" id="chapter14_21" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Thereafter, Loud was in constant touch with the district officer for Haifa, a Mr. Bailey, regarding what he called “precautionary guarding” for the site and the dig house. As Loud noted in his field diary, “Altho I am not apprehensive of any great danger, still we must recognize the fact that there are <span aria-label="266" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_266" role="doc-pagebreak" title="266"></span>brigands in the hills back of us and should be prepared for a possible attack.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-22" id="chapter14_22" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In fact, on the last day of January, those “brigands,” as Loud called them, but who were actually part of the Arab Revolt of 1936–39 rather than simple highway bandits, fired upon troops in the village of Umm el-Fahm, which is located not far from Megiddo in the Wadi Ara pass leading into the Jezreel Valley—the same route that both Thutmose III and General Allenby had taken thirty-four hundred years apart. As Loud again noted in his field diary, this led to a full-fledged battle between the “brigands” and the troops. Reinforcements were sent by the British, who also ordered bombs dropped from planes flying above the rebel gang. Loud reported that they could hear bombing and machine-gun fire throughout the afternoon and evening, but by the next morning the ongoing battle appeared to have moved farther away from them.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-23" id="chapter14_23" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In the meantime, in the area of the “east dig”—Area BB—by the third week in February they had already hit bedrock. This was a huge accomplishment, since they now had the entire sequence of occupation, from beginning to end, at the mound. In fact, in the final report that Loud submitted to the Department of Antiquities, he said that their primary achievement for the season had been “the establishment of the complete range of occupation of the site by clearance to bedrock of the large east area.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-24" id="chapter14_24" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> He then went through the various levels, in detail.</p>

      <p class="TX">Starting at the bottom, he noted that Stratum XX, the earliest building period at the site, lay immediately upon the bedrock. The architecture consisted mainly of crudely built stone walls, while the pottery was a mixture of Neolithic and Chalcolithic shapes—primarily bowls made of very coarse gray ware and with decoration similar to that on bowls that had been found not too far away at Neolithic Jericho. They weren’t certain of the exact date for this earliest evidence of occupation at Megiddo, which we now think started about 5000 BCE, but Shipton thought the pottery indicated that the mid-fourth millennium (i.e., ca. 3400 BCE) seemed to be about right for the end of this period.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-25" id="chapter14_25" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Intriguingly, while tracing the bedrock down the eastern slope of the mound, they happened upon a huge cave in which there was no pottery but a “considerable quantity of flints and bones.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-26" id="chapter14_26" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> This may well have been the original “Ground Zero,” as it were, where humans first settled down for any length of time at Megiddo and perhaps began tending domesticated plants and animals.</p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="267" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_267" role="doc-pagebreak" title="267"></span>The next level, Stratum XIX, was much more interesting to Loud. He thought that the pottery was still primarily Chalcolithic, though some Early Bronze Age forms were beginning to show up; the level is now more usually dated simply to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (EB IB). In this level, “architecture suddenly appears fully developed,” he said. Here they found a portion of a large building constructed of mudbrick on a stone foundation, which had a wall three meters wide that ran across their entire excavation area. This formed one side of a room in which there appeared to be some sort of altar. There were also two superimposed temples found in this area, including one that Loud identified as Temple 4050.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-27" id="chapter14_27" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Down below these buildings, and leading to the eastern edge of the mound, Loud had begun unearthing already in late December a pavement of stones, on many of which were scratched drawings of humans and animals. The Tel Aviv Expedition reexamined this area in 2008 and found more such etchings on these stones, which has now been dubbed the “Picture Pavement.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-28" id="chapter14_28" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The next level, Stratum XVIII, also contained both Chalcolithic and Early Bronze pottery, but now the Early Bronze forms dominated, so it appeared that the site was firmly in the Early Bronze Age by this point, meaning a <span aria-label="268" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_268" role="doc-pagebreak" title="268"></span>chronological date in the third millennium BCE. Here they uncovered 150 feet of an absolutely tremendous city wall (Wall 4045). It stood five meters high and was originally four meters thick but was then doubled in width later in the period, so that it measured fully eight meters thick. This may have been the largest city wall ever built at Megiddo, but Loud and his team removed it completely after taking pictures, in order to proceed down to bedrock.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-29" id="chapter14_29" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> I would hope that future archaeologists, when they get down to this level in an adjacent area, will have the common sense to leave it in place.</p>

      <p class="TX">Fortunately, the Chicago excavators did leave untouched the other major architectural find from this season within this area. This is the now-famous round stone altar (4017) that is currently the most prominent structure within the deep trench that Chicago left in Area BB, readily seen from the tourist lookout point at the Northern Observation Platform at the site. First built in Stratum XVIII, it continued in use during the next few levels. Loud initially mentioned it in his field diary entry on 11 January: “The temple area holds the center of interest for the day with the appearance at the west end of the cut of a strange stone structure—circular in plan with diameter of about 8 meters, with battered sides, and with a stairway at the east.… All about it the earth is full of EB sherds and bones, but no complete vessels or skeletons.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-30" id="chapter14_30" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The large number of bones discovered in this area has led some present-day tour guides to assert that child sacrifice was performed on this altar by the Canaanites during the Early Bronze Age. However, when the Tel Aviv Expedition reexcavated this area, the excavations yielded thousands of bones from this area, which were mostly from sheep and goats, as well as from cattle, and even from a lion and an ostrich or two, but none were the bones of children.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-31" id="chapter14_31" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Loud was correct that the next stratum, Level XVII, was fully situated in the Early Bronze Age. The pottery forms included serving platters, bowls, and vessels with handles that formed small ledges for holding and carrying. There was also a large-scale building that continued beyond their excavation area, and which Loud thought might be another temple.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-32" id="chapter14_32" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">To all of this, we should append Loud’s report from the previous season, which continued the description of these levels in Area BB.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-33" id="chapter14_33" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Here he said that Strata XVI through XIII showed very little change throughout the period. The characteristic pottery found in these levels was made of a red burnished fabric. Loud thought that these levels dated to the Middle Bronze Age, but in fact Strata XVI–XIV are now considered still to be in the Early <span aria-label="269" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_269" role="doc-pagebreak" title="269"></span>Bronze Age and the Intermediate Bronze Age, while it is Stratum XIII that is considered to be the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, ca. 2000 BCE (see <a href="07_preface.html#table001">table 1</a> in the preface). Perhaps most impressive was a large city wall, made of mudbrick, which completely encircled the mound during Stratum XIII; the current Tel Aviv Expedition has recovered more of this impressive mudbrick wall in their Area K in recent years.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-34" id="chapter14_34" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">In his 1937 report, Loud says that “there is no hiatus between the pottery of XII and XIII, the one is the natural development of the other.” He did correctly date Stratum XII, stating, “There is little doubt, however, that Stratum XII must have its inception somewhere in the middle of the 18th century B.C.” The pottery here was similar to that of the previous periods, frequently made of a red burnished fabric that seemed to have parallels with ceramics found at sites up in Syria.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-35" id="chapter14_35" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Strata XI and X fell into what Loud properly identified as the Hyksos period. This was the final period of the Middle Bronze Age; it was during this time that invaders from the general region of Canaan descended upon Egypt and took over as rulers from ca. 1720 to ca. 1550 BCE.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-36" id="chapter14_36" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">These levels at Megiddo, and the tombs from the period, are full of Hyksos scarabs as well as daggers and spearheads known to have been associated <span aria-label="270" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_270" role="doc-pagebreak" title="270"></span>with them. This was a period of warfare, sustained in part by innovations in weaponry including a new type of chariot and the introduction of the composite bow, which could shoot farther than earlier types; both contributed to the Hyksos conquest of Egypt at this time. It was also during this period that Loud thought Temple 2048 had first been constructed,<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-37" id="chapter14_37" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> with periodic rebuilding and renovation throughout the next few levels. Now it was gone, for they had just spent much of this season removing it completely.</p>

      <p class="TX">Stratum IX saw the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. Loud dated it from 1550 to 1479 BCE and thought that it was the city which Thutmose III had conquered. He may well be correct; it will probably have been either Stratum IX or VIII that the Egyptians captured, but IX seems more likely, since there is no real break between VIII and VII, as mentioned.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-38" id="chapter14_38" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Instead, Stratum VIII saw the beginning of the construction in Area AA of what would become the elaborate palace with the gold hoard and the ivory treasures of level VII. It also is the period in which consistent international trade begins with Cyprus and the Aegean, including imported Cypriot and Mycenaean pottery. There are also substantial buildings from this period in Area BB, such as Temple 2048, as just discussed.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-39" id="chapter14_39" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Stratum VII, Loud said, had two distinct building or rebuilding phases: VIIB and then VIIA. Together they cover the period from 1350 to 1150 BCE or a bit later (i.e., the time of the Egyptian Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties as well as part of the early Twentieth Dynasty).<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-40" id="chapter14_40" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> This will have been the time that Biridiya ruled Megiddo, during the mid-fourteenth century BCE, and was in communication with the Egyptian pharaohs Amenhotep III and his son Akhenaten.</p>

      <p class="TX">And that brought them to Stratum VI, the burnt mudbrick city belonging to the early Iron Age, about which much had already been written. Above that lay Strata V through I, which Lamon and Shipton were publishing, and which covered the periods from the flourishing of the Northern Kingdom of Israel through the Neo-Assyrians, Neo-Babylonians, and Persians.</p>

      <p class="SB1">By the time Matthews’s visit drew near, Loud’s attitude had changed even further, for at the beginning of March he received a death threat. While going to the village for milk early in the morning, one of the house staff discovered a letter that had been left next to the path that led across the tell. <span aria-label="271" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_271" role="doc-pagebreak" title="271"></span>The contents announced that the letter was from the “Black Hand Gang,” and that all excavation work should be stopped immediately or Loud would die. It was signed with six blood stains.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-41" id="chapter14_41" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Although Loud was convinced that there was no real danger, he had the letter read out loud to the workmen at the end of the day and told them there would be no more digging until they had resolved this matter. He also notified Bailey, the district commissioner for Haifa, who in turn notified the district commissioner for Nablus, with the end result that two policemen were assigned to sleep in the entrance hall of the dig house each night. The letter itself was sent down to Jerusalem for analysis.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-42" id="chapter14_42" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Then they began working with the local villagers to find out whether this was a serious threat. Several days of meetings, with both the workmen and the other villagers, resulted in the consensus that the letter was probably the work of children rather than of bandits. Nevertheless, Loud subsequently alerted the consul general in Jerusalem and sent several cables to Wilson, apprising him of the situation.</p>

      <p class="TX">Loud also wrote to Matthews, who was by that point in Egypt. “Welcome to these parts!” he began. “I write you all this just as tho you will find us normally carrying on. Actually all work has stopped upon receipt of a miserable death threat which I have every reason to believe will turn out to be nothing but a harmless piece of mischief. Until I have such proof, however, we shall continue to comply with the terms of the threat by keeping the work stopped.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-43" id="chapter14_43" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> Loud said further that he was certain by the time Matthews and his wife, Dagmar, arrived, it would all be resolved. It had been raining every day anyway, he said, so they hadn’t lost any digging time because of the death threat.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-44" id="chapter14_44" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">After ten days, and with the assurance of the local district officer from Jenin that there was probably nothing to fear, Loud sent out a notice to the workmen that work would begin again on 12 March. All of them showed up for work early that morning, but so did a second letter. This one was tied to a square marker next to the main path leading to the tell—and it stated that this would be the last warning. Loud also noted in his field diary that some of the workmen had received a similar warning while on the road the previous evening, but he didn’t give any further details.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-45" id="chapter14_45" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The next day a squad of policemen showed up, with a police dog that promptly picked up the scent and traced it to the village of Lejjun, only to lose it in the stream there. Nevertheless, two men and four boys were brought in as suspects. Although, as Loud put it, “all fail[ed] to confess after <span aria-label="272" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_272" role="doc-pagebreak" title="272"></span>beating,” they recognized three of the boys as having been recently fired from the dig.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-46" id="chapter14_46" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">As it turned out, those three were innocent; it was a different set of three boys who were responsible. They were finally turned in by one of their companions to whom the letter writer had made the mistake of bragging about what they had done. All three were subsequently interrogated and confessed to writing the letters, after their fathers were called in as well.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-47" id="chapter14_47" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Although the sentencing explicitly called for five years in reform school, Loud and the others didn’t want to pursue the matter, so the boys were released “on bond of good behavior.” By this point, however, it was nearly the end of March, so the boys’ actions had cost the workmen who came from the village almost a month’s worth of wages each. As a result, when they were brought home by their fathers, they were punished by their neighbors, including being beaten and spat upon for what they had done.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-48" id="chapter14_48" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">That same day, 24 March, the Matthewses arrived at the dig, along with the Braidwoods again, so the timing was perfect. Excavation started up a day or so later, and since the Matthewses stayed until the last day of the month, they were able to see the dig in action after all.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-49" id="chapter14_49" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Despite feeling that the mystery had been solved, and that the threat had indeed turned out to be a prank by a few boys, several of the workmen were hired to serve as night guards from then on. This was in addition to the two policemen who were still sleeping in the entrance hallway of the dig house.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-50" id="chapter14_50" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Amusingly, on the last day of March, two letters arrived from an actual local bandit leader, “written on official stationery.” In the letters, which were identical (one had apparently been delayed), the bandit leader was at pains to assure Loud that he had had nothing to do with the death threats. In fact, he said, the dig had nothing to fear from them, since they considered the archaeologists “their countrymen” who were kind to the local Arab villagers.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-51" id="chapter14_51" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Moreover, the bandit leader said, Loud was to notify him personally if there were any future threats, so that the bandits could locate and punish “any trick players.” He closed by adding that only letters written on official stationery should be considered genuine.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-52" id="chapter14_52" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Undoubtedly, Loud was as surprised as any of us would be to find out that bandits have “official stationery.” Nevertheless, he was relieved to receive these two letters of reassurance and wrote in his field diary, “All in all I think we have from this source far greater protection than from the po<span aria-label="273" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_273" role="doc-pagebreak" title="273"></span>lice.” The bandit leader followed up by sending a letter to the villagers, telling them that they needed to go back to work on the mound; a few days later, he showed up at the dig house in person to reassure Loud that they had nothing to fear from him or his gang.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-53" id="chapter14_53" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>

      <p class="SB1">With the exception of the work stoppage during most of the month of March, the team was able to continue working pretty much straight from late November through the end of April, a normal dig season for Loud. However, they did require some $2,000 in additional advance money sent by Matthews toward the end of the season. This was in part because they had an extra team member for the entire season, Preston Frazer, as well as another new member for the second half of the season.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-54" id="chapter14_54" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">This second additional staff member was Gustavus Debrille Pope, Jr., a twenty-six-year-old budding archaeologist from Detroit, Michigan, who was called simply “Tony” by his friends. He is listed in the official Megiddo records, as well as on various websites, as having been a member of the staff during the final season, 1938–39, but in fact Loud’s entries in his field diary indicate that Pope was present from mid-February through the end of this penultimate season as well. About ten years later, Pope went on to receive his PhD from Yale and became an archaeologist working primarily in Connecticut and Massachusetts for most of his career.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-55" id="chapter14_55" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The last day of digging was on 27 April, and the Egyptians left for home the next day. Iliffe came up, as usual, for the division of the artifacts, which took place over the course of several days in early May. Included in the division this year were all of the 386 ivories from the previous season, counting those that had been on loan for exhibition in the States during the past year. Loud noted that the objects sent back from the States had unfortunately been badly packed for the return journey to British Mandate Palestine, and nearly a third of them—39 out of 113 pieces—had to be mended again before the division could take place.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-56" id="chapter14_56" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The dig officially shut down on 15 May. Loud wrote to Matthews the day before, noting, “We’re closing up tomorrow and I’m not sorry.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter14-57" id="chapter14_57" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> As it turned out, the 1937–38 season went down in the books as the year that they finished compiling the occupation sequence of Megiddo—it was a successful season despite the problems swirling about them in British Mandate Palestine at the time.</p>
