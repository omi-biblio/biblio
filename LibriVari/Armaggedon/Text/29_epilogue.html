      <h1 class="CTT"><b>“Certain Digging Areas Remain Incompletely Excavated”</b></h1>

      <p class="CO">By way of conclusion, I should note that, prior to writing this book, I had always wondered why Chicago didn’t resume their excavations at Megiddo after World War II. Now we know the answer: they fully intended to. As we have seen, Hamilton agreed to extend their claim until two years after the hostilities ended. By that time, though, Loud was out of archaeology and working in the petroleum industry. And before the Oriental Institute could find someone else to lead the renewed excavations, it was 1948 and the dig house was looted, with all the equipment stolen, and then accidentally set on fire. As Parker wrote, they were back to where they had been in 1926. So, rather than begin all over again, the Oriental Institute simply started digging elsewhere in the Middle East. The Chicago years at Megiddo thus came to an end, but the site was by no means exhausted.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Lamon and Shipton’s <i>Megiddo I</i> volume, on the 1925–34 seasons, appeared in 1939. Loud’s <i>Megiddo II</i> volume, on the 1935–39 seasons, was completed three years later, in 1942. However, because of the war it was not published until six years later, finally appearing in 1948.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-1" id="bm1_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Loud himself admitted that the <i>Megiddo II</i> volume was less than satisfactory. He began the foreword by saying: “This is not the exhaustive publication of the earlier strata at Megiddo anticipated by the staff during the years [that] the excavation of this material was in progress. It falls short of its intended comprehensiveness on two counts, both due to World War II.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-2" id="bm1_2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">He gave as one reason the fact that the final season had never come to pass, which meant that “certain digging areas remain incompletely excavated.” They had intended, for example, to excavate more than twice the <span aria-label="298" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_298" role="doc-pagebreak" title="298"></span>area in the earliest levels that they had actually done—while the upper strata had been removed, the team had not investigated the lower levels. They also had not been able to completely connect the various digging areas, resulting in numerous loose ends.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-3" id="bm1_3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In addition, Loud said, the presentation of the material in the volume was incomplete because “one by one the members of the staff … were called to serve in one capacity or another the war emergency.” They had been faced with a choice: to either suspend work on the volume for the duration of the war or “to publish it in catalogue form, thereby making the facts at least available to the scientific world with the least possible delay.” They had opted for the latter, Loud said, and therefore his opening words were a warning that the volume “pretends to be no more than a catalogue of the architecture and artifacts recovered primarily in the seasons of 1935–39.” Although a “certain amount of descriptive text is included,” he was well aware that the volume as a whole was insufficient, and therefore specifically invited future scholars “to take up the task where the excavators have been forced to lay it aside.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-4" id="bm1_4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Each of these volumes received pushback from colleagues right away. The most important feedback was the questioning by others of the dating and assignations of buildings and artifacts to various strata, especially Strata IV and V, made by Lamon and Shipton in their <i>Megiddo I</i> volume. John Crowfoot, the excavator of Samaria, started things off with a review published in the <i>Palestine Exploration Quarterly</i> in 1940, in which he disagreed with their dating of these levels, arguing instead that the stables of Stratum IV were to be dated to the time of Ahab, and that it was Stratum V which dated to the time of Solomon.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-5" id="bm1_5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Even Herbert May, the former team member whose volume entitled <i>Material Remains of the Megiddo Cult</i> had been published in 1935, got into the act. In early February 1940, he wrote to Albright, saying he had been looking again at Fisher’s “Astarte temple” and wondering “whether Fisher did or did not see … two building periods when there were really only one.” He continued, “I find it difficult to follow Lamon’s reasoning at many points … and find myself in considerable disagreement with the conclusions of Lamon.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-6" id="bm1_6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Albright’s initial review of the volume, which included his review of Shipton’s pottery volume as well, appeared in 1940 in the <i>American Journal of Archaeology</i>. It was a fairly positive review, on the whole. However, by 1943, quite likely influenced in part by the letter sent to him by May, Albright <span aria-label="299" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_299" role="doc-pagebreak" title="299"></span>suggested that Lamon and Shipton had indeed erred in some of their assignations. He also renamed their Stratum IV as IVA, since they had already created IVB.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-7" id="bm1_7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In addition, in his <i>Megiddo II</i> volume, Loud subsequently subdivided Lamon and Shipton’s Stratum V into VB and VA, although only in his Area DD (and noting that he didn’t actually know which one came first, chronologically). Albright’s former student G. Ernest Wright, who was a professor at the McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago at the time, promptly and specifically proposed in no uncertain terms that even more buildings had been misassigned by the excavators than had originally been thought, and that the strata to which they belonged therefore needed to be revised and renumbered yet again.</p>

      <p class="TX">Wright suggested specifically that Stratum IVB in Area CC and Stratum VA in Area DD went together and should be referred to as Stratum VA/IVB, as it has been ever since. And, most impactfully for some scholars, it was this level that he and others said should be identified as the “city of Solomon,” based upon the reworkings and suggestions made by Crowfoot, Albright, and Wright over the years.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-8" id="bm1_8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> This is the layer to which Palaces 1723 and 6000 are now assigned, and which Yigael Yadin also thought dated to the time of Solomon. However, that did not settle the matter, for Finkelstein and others would now date this level to the time of Omri and Ahab instead, on the basis of comparisons to buildings and stonemasons’ marks at the site of Samaria (which was built by Omri and Ahab).</p>

      <p class="TX">The debate, which is admittedly very confusing even to those integrally involved, has continued apace.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-9" id="bm1_9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Normally, none of this would be of interest to anyone but archaeologists, and even just a small fraction of those. However, since we are still trying to figure out which level at Megiddo might be attributable to Solomon, this has remained a discussion of interest to a great many people. In fact, in terms of finding Solomonic Megiddo, it seems that the Chicago excavators were far less successful than Guy had initially thought, when the stables were first discovered back in 1928.</p>

      <p class="TX">To put it plainly, it seems fair to say that what were once identified by Guy in that June 1928 cable as “Solomon’s stables” soon became “Ahab’s stables” and now are possibly “Jeroboam II’s stables.” So too the various excavators (and other scholars) have so far attached the moniker “city of Solomon” to at least four different levels at Megiddo. Guy was convinced that Stratum IVA was Solomon’s Megiddo (but it might actually be Jeroboam II’s); Crowfoot, Albright, Wright, and Yadin thought it was Stratum VA/IVB <span aria-label="300" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_300" role="doc-pagebreak" title="300"></span>(but that is probably Ahab/Omri’s); and now Ussishkin has tentatively suggested that it is Stratum VB (despite the fact that that stratum is less than impressive). However, as mentioned, in 1996, Finkelstein suggested that Stratum VIA could date to the tenth century and the time of the United Monarchy,<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-10" id="bm1_10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and I would agree that this burnt mudbrick city should still be considered a contender, perhaps almost by default since most of the others have been ruled out. This, of course, is assuming that there even is a Solomonic city to find at the site. The one thing that we can all agree upon is that Solomonic Megiddo has been extremely difficult to find; we may never have a definitive identification.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Enough questions remained after the end of Chicago’s excavations at Megiddo that, as noted at the beginning of this book, Yigael Yadin came with his graduate students from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for several seasons in the 1960s and early 1970s.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-11" id="bm1_11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Twenty years after that, there were still enough questions remaining, and new ones that had emerged, for Israel Finkelstein and David Ussishkin of Tel Aviv University to begin their renewed series of excavations at the site in 1992. This most recent set of excavations has now continued every other summer for fourteen seasons—the same number as the Chicago excavators put in.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#bm1-12" id="bm1_12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">And yet, even with all that digging, beginning with Schumacher in 1903, we have barely scratched the surface of this ancient site of Armageddon and have plumbed its depths down to bedrock in only one area. Much still remains to be discovered. Moreover, despite the best efforts of the Chicago excavators, as well as Schumacher before them and two additional expeditions that came after them, there is still no clear answer to the specific questions that led Breasted to undertake the excavations at Megiddo in the first place: which city was the one fortified by Solomon, and which one was captured by Thutmose III?</p>

      <p class="TX">Perhaps those questions will finally be resolved by the current Tel Aviv Expedition or by a future archaeological expedition, whenever that occurs. Or perhaps they are destined never to be answered. We now know that we cannot place such demands on archaeology; we can only interpret what we happen to uncover, to the best of our abilities. That has not changed since the days of Fisher, Guy, and Loud.</p>
