  <h2>VI<br/>The Golden Men</h2>

  <p class="normal">IN 1946, when Nyuk Tsin was ninety-nine years old, a group of sociologists in Hawaii were perfecting a concept whose vague outlines had occupied them for some years, and quietly among themselves they suggested that in Hawaii a new type of man was being developed. He was a man influenced by both the west and the east, a man at home in either the business councils of New York or the philosophical retreats of Kyoto, a man wholly modern and American yet in tune with the ancient and the Oriental. The name they invented for him was the Golden Man.</p>

  <p class="normal">At first I erroneously thought that both the concept and the name were derived from the fact that when races intermingled sexually, the result was apt to be a man neither all white nor all brown nor all yellow, but somewhere in between; and I thought that the Golden Man concept referred to the coloring of the new man—a blend of Chinese, Polynesian and Caucasian, for at this time Japanese rarely intermarried—and I went about the streets of Hawaii looking for the golden man of whom the sociologists spoke.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in time I realized that this bright, hopeful man of the future, this unique contribution of Hawaii to the rest of the world, did not depend for his genesis upon racial intermarriage at all. He was a product of the mind. His was a way of thought, and not of birth, and one day I discovered, with some joy I may add, that for several years I had known the archetypes of the Golden Man, and if the reader has followed my story so far, he also knows three of them well and is about to meet the fourth, and it is interesting that none of these, in a direct sense, owed his golden quality to racial intermixtures. His awareness of the future and his rare ability to stand at the conflux of the world he owed to his understanding of the movements around him. I have known a good many golden men in the secondary, or unimportant, sense: fine Chinese-Hawaiians, excellent Portuguese-Chinese and able Caucasian-Hawaiians; but most of them had little concept of what was happening either in Hawaii or in the world. But the four men of whom I now wish to speak did know, and it is in reference to their knowledge that I wish to end my story of Hawaii, for they are indeed the Golden Men.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1946, when the war had ended and Hawaii was about to explode belatedly into the twentieth century, Hoxworth Hale was forty-eight years old; and one morning, when the trade winds had died away and the weather was unbearably sticky, he happened to look into his mirror while shaving, and the thought came to him: “This year I am as good a man as I shall ever be in this life. I have most of my teeth, a good deal of my hair, I’m not too much overweight, and my eyes are good enough to see distances without glasses, though close up I have a little trouble, and I suppose I’ll have to see an oculist. I can still concentrate on a problem, and I derive pleasure from control of business. I like to go to work, even on mornings like this.” He pummeled his midriff to start perspiration before entering the shower, and as the hot, muggy day closed in upon him he was forced to inspect the two areas in which he was no longer so good a man as he once had been.</p>

  <p class="normal">First, there was the gnawing, never-ending pain that started when his son Bromley was shot down during the great fire of Tokyo in 1945, when the air corps practically destroyed the city. More than 70,000 Japanese had died in the great raids, and a city too, so that in one sense Bromley’s death had contributed positive results, and after his raids victory for our side was assured. But Bromley Hale was a special young man. Everyone said so, and his departure left a gap both in the Hale family and in Hawaii that would never be filled, for in his last letters home, when capricious death had become so routine in his B-29 squadron as to depress all the fliers, he had spoken intimately of what he hoped to accomplish when the war ended, as soon it must.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had written, from a hut on Iwo Jima: “We had to ditch our monstrous plane in the waters near here, and by the grace of God we were all saved, but in the going down, as I worked with the wheel I was not so much concerned about a perfect water landing as I was with my determination to do what years ago I had sworn to do while a senior at Punahou. I am determined to write a novel about—and this may stagger you, but bear with me—Aunt Lucinda Whipple. I shall have her sitting in the late afternoons in her house in Nuuanu Valley, and each day as the afternoon rains sweep down from the Pali and the white mildew grows on all things, she entertains the straggling members of our family. It has always seemed to me that Aunt Lucinda was everybody’s aunt, and everybody comes to her and listens to her monotonous chatter about the old days, and nothing I write will make any sense at all—only an old woman’s ceaseless vanity—until it begins to weave a spell, the kind of spell in which you and I have always lived. I shall show Aunt Lucinda exactly as she is, religious, family-proud, unseeing, unknowing, garrulous and unbelievably kind. She has become to me a web, a fatal emanation, an encroaching dream, and as our plane struck the water, I was listening not to my copilot, who was frantic as hell, but to dear old Aunt Lucinda. How she hated airplanes and fast automobiles and Japanese. As a matter of fact, if you took time to analyze it carefully, I guess she hated everybody but the Whipples, and the Janderses, and the Hales, and the Hewletts, and the Hoxworths. But even they gave her a lot of trouble, for she always took great pains to explain to visitors that she came from the branch of the Whipple family that had never had even a drop of Hawaiian blood, and she kept segregated in her mind those of her great family of whom this could not be said. She was suspicious of you and me, because we were not pure English stock; and of course all the Hoxworths and half the Hewletts were contaminated, and often when I spoke with her she would hesitate, and I knew she was thinking: ‘I’d better not tell him that, because after all, he is one of the contaminated.’</p>

  <p class="normal">“And from Aunt Lucinda’s endless vagaries I want to construct an image of all Hawaii and the peoples who came to build it. I want to deal with the first volcano and the last sugar strike. You may not like my novel, but it will be accurate, and I think that counts for something. It is strange, I have been writing about Aunt Lucinda as if she were dead, but she is living and it may be I who shall be dead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This dreadful hurt never left Hoxworth Hale’s heart, and he started listening to Aunt Lucinda’s meanderings, and he picked up the thoughts that his son had laid down: “We live in a web. Sugar cane, Hawaiian ghosts, pineapple, ships, streetcar lines, Japanese labor leaders, Aunt Lucinda’s memories.” The web became most tenuous, and at the same time most cruelly oppressive, when it involved the upstairs rooms where several of the great families kept the delicate women whose minds had begun to wander past even the accepted norm, and in one such room Hoxworth’s own wife passed her days. In the 1920’s, at Punahou, Malama Janders, as she was then, had been a laughing, poetic young lady, interested in music and boys, but as the years passed, and especially since the 1940’s, her mind lost its focus and she preferred not to try understanding what had happened to her son Bromley or what her dashing daughter Noelani was doing. Her only joy came when someone drove her up Nuuanu Valley to Aunt Lucinda’s, and there the two women would sit in the rainy afternoons talking of things that never quite got into sequence . . . and neither cared.</p>

  <p class="normal">For generations the missionaries had railed against Hawaiians for having allowed brothers to marry sisters, and on no aspect of Hawaiian life was New England moral judgment sterner than on this. “It puts the Hawaiian outside the pale of civilized society,” Lucinda Whipple’s ancestors had stormed, particularly her great-grandfather Abner Hale, and yet the same curse had now overtaken her own great interlocking family. Whipples married Janderses, and Janderses married Hewletts, and if full brothers and sisters did not physically wed, intellectually and emotionally they did, so that a girl named Jerusha Hewlett Hoxworth was practically indistinguishable either in genes or ideas from a Malama Janders Hale, and each stayed mostly in an upstairs room.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1946, therefore, except for the death of his son, and the slow decline of his adored wife, Hoxworth Hale was truly as good a man as he would ever be, but those two bereavements oppressed him and prevented his enjoyment of the last powerful flowering of his talents. He therefore turned his whole attention to the government of the Hoxworth &amp; Hale empire, and as the critical year started he relied more and more upon two stalwart resolves: “I will not give labor an inch, not another inch, especially when, it’s led by Japanese who don’t really understand American ways. And we have got to keep Hawaii as it is. I will not have mainland firms like Gregory’s elbowing their way in here and disrupting our Hawaiian economy.” Behind him, to back up these two mighty resolves, he had the entire resources of H &amp; H, totaling some $260,000,000 and all the managerial strength of J &amp; W, now worth more than $185,000,000. Lesser outfits like Hewlett and Son had to string along, for all saw in Hoxworth Hale the cool and able man, one above the passions of the moment, who could be depended upon to preserve their way of life.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only in his understanding of what was happening should Hoxworth Hale be considered a Golden Man. Racially he was mostly haole. Emotionally he was all haole, and he thought of himself in that way. Actually, of course, he was one-sixteenth Hawaiian, inherited through the Alii Nui Noelani, who was his great-great-grandmother. He was also part-Arabian, for one of his European ancestors had married during the Crusades, part-African through an earlier Roman ancestor, part-Central Asian from an Austrian woman who had married a Hungarian in 1603, and part-American Indian through a cute trick that an early Hale’s wife had pulled on him in remote Massachusetts. But he was known as pure haole, whatever that means.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1946 Hong Kong Kee was five years older than Hoxworth Hale, which made him exactly fifty-three, whereas his grandmother Nyuk Tsin was ninety-nine. This was not a particularly good year for Hong Kong, because in following his grandmother’s urgent advice—”Buy every piece of land that frightened haoles want to sell”—he had somewhat overextended himself and frankly did not know where he was going to find tax money to protect the large parcels of land on which he was sitting. Real estate had not been doing well; the anticipated boom in tourists had not yet materialized; and there was a prospect of long strikes in both sugar and pineapple. He had seven children in school, five in mainland colleges and two at Punahou, and for a while he considered abruptly cutting off their allowances and telling the boys to get to work and help pay taxes, but Nyuk Tsin would not hear of this. Her counsel was simple: “Every child must have the very best education possible. Every piece of land must be held as long as possible. If this means no automobiles and no expensive food, good! We won’t ride and we won’t eat!” The Kee hui was therefore on very short rations, and Hong Kong sent a form letter to all the Kees studying on the mainland—his own and others: “I will be able to pay only your tuition and books. If you are running an automobile, sell it and go to work. If you are faced by the prospect of spending two or even three more years in college under this plan, spend it, but for the time being there can be no more money from Hawaii!” The decision that hurt him most involved his youngest daughter, Judy. “You have to cut out private singing lessons,” he told her, and it was sad to see her obey.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, when things were already difficult, Hong Kong surreptitiously heard that a well-known firm of mainland private detectives was investigating him. He picked up a rumor of this from one of the Ching clan who had been asked a good many questions about real-estate deals, and the interrogation had made no sense until a few days later when Lew Ching suddenly thought: “My God! Every one of those deals involved Hong Kong Kee!” And he felt obligated to lay this circumstantial evidence before his friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong’s first reaction was, “The income tax people are after me!” But reflection assured him that this was ridiculous, for certainly the government never used private detective agencies when they had such good ones of their own. This conclusion, however, left him more bewildered than ever, and gradually he came to suspect that The Fort had deduced that he might be overextended and was collecting evidence which would enable them to squeeze him out, once and for all. He judged that the mastermind was probably Hoxworth Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">His first substantial bit of evidence came, curiously, not from the Chinese, who were adroit in piecing together fragments of puzzles, but from his friend Kamejiro Sakagawa, whom he had helped establish in the supermarket business. Squat little Kamejiro bustled in one afternoon to announce bluntly: “Hong Kong, you bettah watch out, I t’ink you in big trouble. Dick from da mainland come to dis rock, ast me about you, how I git my land. Bimeby latah he go into da building H &amp; H.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This detective, he had no reason to bother you, Kamejiro,” Hong Kong assured him. “Our deal is perfectly good.” “Whassamatta, dey ketch you from taxes?” “Mine are okay. How about yours?” “Mine okay too,” Kamejiro assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then don’t you worry, Kamejiro. Let me worry. This has to do only with me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You in special trouble?” the Japanese asked. “Everybody’s always in trouble,” Hong Kong assured him. But what precise trouble he himself was in, Hong Kong could not discover. In succeeding days he caught various reports of the detectives and their work; all aspects of his varied business life were under surveillance. He never spotted any of the detectives himself, and then suddenly they vanished, and he heard no more about them. All he knew was: “Somebody knows almost as much about my business as I do. And they’re reporting to Hoxworth Hale.” He did not sleep easily.</p>

  <p class="normal">In another sense, these were exciting times, for unless everything that Hong Kong and his grandmother had concluded from their studies was false, Hawaii had to be on the verge of startling expansion. Airplanes, no longer required for warfare, were going to ferry thousands of tourists to Hawaii, and many new hotels would be required. On the day that the boom started, the builders would have to come to Hong Kong, for he had the land, and he felt like a superb runner on the eve of an Olympics which would test him against athletes whom he had not previously encountered: he was a good runner, he was in tense condition, and he was willing to trust the morrow’s luck. Even so, he took the precaution of discussing the detective mystery with his grandmother, and she pointed out to Hong Kong: “These are the years when we must sit tight. Wait, wait. That’s always very difficult to do. Any fool can engage in action, but only the wise men can wait. It seems to me that if someone is spending so much money to investigate you, either he fears you very much, which is good, or he is weighing the prospects of joining you, which could be better. Therefore what you must do is wait, wait. Let him make the first move. If he is going to fight you, each day that passes makes you stronger. If he is going to join you, each day that you survive makes the cost to him a little greater. Wait.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So through most of 1946 Hong Kong waited, but without the confidence his grandmother commanded. Each day’s mail tortured him, for he would sit staring at the long envelopes, wondering what bad news they brought; and he dreaded cables. But as he waited, he gathered strength, and as the year ended and his mind grew clearer and his financial position stronger, he began to resemble the Golden Man of whom the sociologists had spoken.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong thought of himself as pure Chinese, for his branch of the family had married only Hakka girls, and whereas there were a good many Kees with Hawaiian and Portuguese and Filipino blood, he had none, a fact of which he was quietly proud. Of course, from past adventures of the Kee hui Hong Kong’s ancestors had picked up a good deal of Mongolian blood, and Manchurian, and Tartar, plus a little Japanese during the wars of the early 1600’s, plus some Korean via an ancestor who had traveled in that peninsula in 814, augmented by a good deal of nondescript inheritance from tribes who had wandered about southern China from the year 4000 B.C. on, but nevertheless he thought of himself as pure Chinese, whatever that means.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1946 young Shigeo Sakagawa was twenty-three years old, and now a full captain in the United States army. He was five feet six inches tall and weighed a lean 152 pounds. He did not wear glasses and was considerably better coordinated than his stocky and somewhat awkward peasant father. He had a handsome face with strong, clear complexion and very good teeth, but his most conspicuous characteristic was a quick intellect which had marked him in whatever military duties he had been required to perform. The three citations that accompanied his army medals spoke of courage beyond the call of duty, but they were really awards for extraordinary ability to anticipate what was about to happen.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the memorable victory parade down Kapiolani Boulevard, Captain Shigeo Sakagawa marched in the third file, behind the flag bearers and the colonel. His feet, hardened from military life, strode over the asphalt briskly, while his shoulders, accustomed to heavy burdens, were pulled back. This brought his chin up, so that his slanted Japanese eyes were forced to look out upon the community in which they had not previously been welcome. But when he heard the thundering applause, and saw from the cornier of his eye his bent mother and his stocky, honest little father, accepted at last, he felt that the struggle had been a good one. Tadao was dead in Italy, and Minoru the stalwart tackle was buried in France. Goro was absent in Japan helping direct the occupation, and the family would never be together again. The Sakagawas had paid a terrible price to prove their loyalty, but it had been worth it. When the marchers were well past the spot where the elder Sakagawas and other Japanese were weeping with joy, the parade reached the old Iolani Palace, seat of Hawaii’s government, and for the first time it looked to Shig Sakagawa like a building which a Japanese might enter, just like anyone else. “This is my town,” he thought as he marched.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when he reached home after the parade and saw the photographs of dead Tadao and Minoru on the wall, he covered his face with his hands and muttered, “If we Japanese are at last free, it was you fellows who did it. Jesus, what a price!”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was therefore embarrassed when his father, still fascinated by military life, fingered his medals and said in English, “Like I tell b’fore, dey got no soldiers mo bettah Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wasn’t brave, Pop. I just happened to see what was going to happen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“S’pose you saw, how come you not run away?” Kamejiro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was Japanese, so I had to stay,” Shig explained. “Too much at stake. I swallowed my fear and for this they gave me medals.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All Japan is proud of you,” Kamejiro said in Japanese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m glad the emperor feels that way,” Shig laughed, “because I’m on my way to help him govern Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shigeo’s mother screamed in Japanese, “You’re not going away to war again, are you? Goro’s already in Japan, and I pray every night.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s no war!” her son explained warmly, clutching her affectionately by the arm. “I’ll be in no danger. Neither will Goro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No war?” Mrs. Sakagawa asked, startled. “Oh, Shigeo! Haven’t you heard? Mr. Ishii says . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mother, don’t bother me with what that crazy Mr. Ishii dreams.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, Mrs. Sakagawa summoned her daughter and Mr. Ishii, and after the wiry little labor leader had carefully inspected all the doors to be sure no haoles were spying, he pulled down the shades and whispered in Japanese, “What I told you last week is true, Kamejiro-san. Under no circumstances should you allow a second son to go to Japan. He will be killed, just like Goro. For everything we have heard is a lie. Japan is winning the war and may invade Hawaii at any moment.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shigeo thought his brain had become unhinged, and he caught Reiko’s hand, asking, “Sister, do you believe your husband’s nonsense?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t call it nonsense!” Mr. Ishii stormed in Japanese. “You have been fed a great collection of lies. Japan is winning the war and is accumulating strength.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Reiko!” her brother insisted. “Do you believe this nonsense?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll have to forgive my husband,” the dutiful wife explained. “He hears such strange reports at the meetings . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What meetings?” Shigeo demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Mr. Ishii and his sister showed him. They took him to a small building west of Nuuanu where a meeting was in progress, attended by elderly Japanese. A fanatical religious leader, recently out of a concentration camp, was shouting in Japanese, “What they tell you about Hiroshima is all lies. The city was not touched. Tokyo was not burned. Our troops are in Singapore and Australia. Japan is more powerful than ever before!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The audience listened intently, and Shigeo saw his brother-in-law, Mr. Ishii, nodding profoundly. At this moment Shigeo unfortunately tugged at his sister’s sleeve, and the speaker saw him. Ah!” he shouted. “I see we have a spy in our midst. A dirty dog of the enemy. You, Mrs. Ishii? Is he trying to tell you that Japan lost the war? Don’t you believe him! He has been bought by the Americans! I tell you, he is a liar and a spy. Japan won the war!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Against his own intelligence, Shigeo had to admit that many of the audience not only believed this crazy religious maniac, but they wanted to believe. When the meeting ended, many of the old people smiled sadly at Shigeo, who had criminally fought against Japan, and they hoped that when the emperor’s troops landed they would deal kindly with him, for he had probably been seduced into his traitorous action. Many boys in Hawaii had been so tricked.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a daze Shigeo started homeward. He wanted no more to do with Mr. Ishii and the pathetic old fools, but when he had walked some distance, he changed his mind and caught a bus that carried him down into the heart of Honolulu, and after some speculation as to what he should do, he marched into the police station, and asked to see one of the detectives. The haole knew him and congratulated him on his medals, but Shig laughed and said, “What I’m going to tell you, you may take them away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s up?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You ever hear of the Katta Gumi Society? The Ever-Victorious Group?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean the Japan-Won screwballs? Yeah, we keep a fairly close watch on them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I just attended a meeting. Captain, I’m shook.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The little hut back of the old mission school?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We check that regularly. Tony, did we have a man at the mission hut tonight?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We didn’t bother tonight,” the assistant replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“These people are out of their minds,” Shig protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s pathetic,” the detective agreed. “Poor old bastards, they were so sure Japan couldn’t be licked that they believe whatever these agitators tell ‘em. But they don’t do any harm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Aren’t you going to arrest them?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hell, no,” the detective laughed. “We got six groups in Honolulu we check on regularly, and the Japan Won’s give us the least trouble. One group wants to murder Syngman Rhee. One wants to murder Chiang Kai-shek. One dupes old women out of all their money by predicting the end of the world on the first of each month. Last year we had one couple that prepared for the second coming of Christ on the first day of eleven succeeding months. They finally came to us and said that maybe something was wrong. So your crazy Japanese are only part of a pattern.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But how can they believe . . . All the newspaper stories and newsreels? The men who were there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shig,” the detective said, plopping his hands upright on the desk. “How can you believe for eleven successive months that Jesus Christ is coming down the Nuuanu Pali? You can be fooled once, I grant, but not eleven times.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the time came for Shigeo to sail to his new job with General MacArthur in Japan, his mother wept and said, “If there is fighting when you get to Tokyo, don’t get off the ship, Shigeo.” Then, recalling more important matters, she told him, “Don’t marry a northern girl, Shigeo. We don’t want any zu-zu-ben in our family. And I’d be careful of Tokyo girls, too. They’re expensive. Your father and I would be very unhappy if you married a Kyushu girl, because they don’t fit in with Hiroshima people. And under no circumstances marry an Okinawan, or anyone who might be an Eta. What would be best would be for you to marry a Hiroshima girl. Such girls you can trust. But don’t take one from Hiroshima City.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think Americans will be welcomed in Hiroshima,” Shigeo said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” his mother protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“After the bomb?” Shigeo asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shigeo!” his mother replied in amazement. “Nothing happened to Hiroshima! Mr. Ishii assured me . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Shig Sakagawa assembled with his Tokyo-bound outfit and marched through the streets of downtown Honolulu on his way to the transport that would take them to Yokohama, he was, without knowing it, a striking young man. He possessed a mind of steel, hardened in battle against both the Germans and the prejudices of his homeland. By personal will power he had triumphed against each adversary and had proved his courage as few men are required to do. No one recognized the fact that day, for then Shig was only twenty-three and had not yet acquired his lawyer’s degree from Harvard, but he was the forward cutting edge of a revolution that was about to break over Hawaii. He was stern, incorruptible, physically hard and fearless. More important, so far as revolutions go, he was well organized and alert.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he marched he passed, without either man’s knowing it, Hoxworth Hale, who was walking up Bishop Street on his way to The Fort, and if in that moment Hale had had the foresight to stop the parade and to enlist Shig Sakagawa on his side, The Fort would surely have been able to preserve its prerogatives. Furthermore, if Hale, as an official of the Republican Party, had conscripted Shig and half a hundred other young Japanese like him, Republicanism in Hawaii would have been perpetually insured, for by their traditional and conservative nature the Japanese would have made ideal Republicans, and a combination of haole business acumen and Japanese industry would have constituted a strength that no adversary could have broken. But it was then totally impossible for Hoxworth Hale even to imagine such a union, and as he walked past the parade he had the ungracious thought: “If I hear any more about the brave Japanese boys who won the war for us, I’ll vomit. Where’s my son Bromley? Where’s Harry Janders and Jimmy Whipple? They won the war, too, and they’re dead.” The crowd along Bishop Street cheered the Japanese boys, and the pregnant moment of history was lost. Hoxworth Hale went to The Fort and Shig Sakagawa went to Japan.</p>

  <p class="normal">But if Hoxworth Hale failed to grasp the nettles of history, there was another who did, for as Hong Kong Kee walked down Bishop Street in the other direction he met Kamejiro Sakagawa proudly waving to his son, and Hong Kong asked, “Which one is your boy, Kamejiro?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dat one ovah dere wid de medals,” Kamejiro beamed. Since most of the Japanese were wearing medals won in Europe, Hong Kong could not determine which one was Kamejiro’s son. “Is he the one who has the red patch on his arm?” Hong Kong asked. “Hai!” old Sakagawa agreed,</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d like to meet your boy,” Hong Kong said, and when the troops broke ranks on the dock Kamejiro said to his son, “Dis Hong Kong Kee, berry good frien’. He give me da money fo’ da stoah’.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With obvious gratitude, Captain Sakagawa thrust out his hand and said, “You had a lot of courage, Mr. Kee, to gamble that way on my father. Especially during the war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong was tempted to bask in glory, but prudence had taught him always to anticipate trouble and to quash it in advance, so he said forthrightly, “Probably you didn’t hear, but during the war I was stupid enough to make a very bad speech against the Japanese. Later, I was ashamed of myself and tried to make up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know,” Shig said. “My sister wrote me about your speech. But war’s war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Things are much better now,” Hong Kong said. “What I wanted to see you about, Shigeo. When you come home you ought to go to college. Maybe law school. You do well, maybe I’ll have a job for you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have a lot of sons of your own, Hong Kong.” “None of them is Japanese,’ Hong Kong laughed. “You want a Japanese?” Shig asked, astounded. “Of course,” Hong Kong grunted. “You boys are going to run the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig grew extraordinarily attentive. Standing directly in front of Hong Kong’s metallic eyes, he studied the Chinese carefully and asked, “Do you really think there’ll be changes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Fantastic,” Hong Kong replied. “I’d like to have a smart boy like you working for me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I may not work for anybody,” Shig said slowly. “That’s good too,” Hong Kong said evenly. “But everybody’s got to have friends.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Captain Sakagawa climbed aboard the transport he felt completely American. He had proved his courage, had been accepted by Honolulu, and now he was wanted by someone. In a sense, he was already a Golden Man, knowledgeable both in western and eastern values, for although he reveled in his newly won Americanism, he also took pride in being a pure-blooded Japanese. Of course this latter was ridiculous, for he contained inheritances from all those nameless predecessors who had once inhabited Japan: some of his genes came from the hairy Ainu to the north, from Siberian invaders, from the Chinese, from the Koreans amongst whom his ancestors had lived, and more particularly from that venturesome Indo-Malayan stock, half of whom had journeyed eastward to become Hawaiians while their brothers had moved northward along different islands to merge with the Japanese. Thus, of two ancient Malayan brothers starting from a point near Singapore, the northern traveler had become the ancestor of Shigeo Sakagawa, while the other had served as the progenitor of Kelly Kanakoa, the Hawaiian beachboy who now stood with a pretty girl watching the end of the parade.</p>

  <p class="normal">Or, if one preferred looking north, of three ancient Siberian brothers, one bravely crossed the sea to Japan, where his genes found ultimate refuge in the body of Shigeo Sakagawa. Another crept along the Aleutian bridge toward Massachusetts, where his descendants wound up as Indian progenitors of Hoxworth Hale; while a third, less venturesome than his brothers, drifted southward along established land routes to central China, where he helped form the Hakka, thus serving as an ancestor to Hong Kong Kee. In truth, all men are brothers, but as generations pass, it is differences that matter and not similarities.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THE</span> irrelevant sense of the word, this Kelly Kanakoa of whom I just spoke was already a Golden Man, for at twenty-one he was slightly over six feet tall, weighed a trim 180, and had a powerful body whose muscles rippled in sunlight as if smeared with coconut oil. He was very straight and had unusually handsome features, marked by deep-set dark eyes, a gamin laugh, and a head of jet-black hair in which he liked to wear a flower. His manner was a mixture of relaxation and insolence, and although it was more than two years since he had knocked out two sailors on Hotel Street for calling him a nigger, he seemed always half ready for a brawl, but whenever one seemed about to explode, he tried to evade it: “Why you like beef wid me? I no want trobble. Let’s shake and be blalahs again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now as Kelly stood watching the departing parade, he held in his right hand the slim, well-manicured fingers of a Tulsa divorcee who had come to Honolulu from Reno, seeking emotional re-orientation after her difficult divorce. At the ranch where she had stayed in Nevada a fellow divorcee had told her, “Rennie! If you go to Hawaii be sure to look up Kelly Kanakoa. He’s adorable.” So as soon as Rennie had disembarked from the H &amp; H flagship, Mauna Loa, she had called the number her friend had given her, announcing: “Hello, Kelly? Maud Clemmens told me to look you up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He had come sauntering around to the luxurious H &amp; H hotel, the Lagoon, wearing very tight blue pants, a white busboy’s jacket with only one button closed, sandals, a yachting cap, and a flower behind his ear. When she came down into the grandiose lobby, crisp and white in a new bathing suit edged in lace, he appraised her insolently and&#160; calculated:&#160;&#160; “This&#160; wahine’s&#160; gonna&#160;&#160; screw&#160; the&#160; first night.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In his job as beachboy, which he had acquired by accident because he liked to surf and had a pleasant joking way with rich women customers, he had become expert in estimating how long it would take him to get into bed with any newcomer. Divorcees, he had found, were easiest because they had undergone great shock to their womanliness and were determined to prove that they, at least, had not been at fault in the breakup of their marriages. It rarely took Kelly more than two nights. Of course when they first met him they certainly had no intention of sleeping with him, but as he explained to the other fellows hanging around the beach, “S’pose da wahine not ride a surfboard yet, how she know what she really wanna do?” It was his job, and he got paid for it, to take divorcees and young widows on surfboards.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ten minutes after Rennie met Kelly she was on her first surfing expedition, far out on the reef where the big waves were forming. She was excited by the exhilarating motion of the sea and felt that she would never be able to rise and stand on the board as it swept her toward shore, but when she felt Kelly’s strong arms enveloping her from the rear she felt assured, and as the board gathered momentum she allowed herself to be pulled upright, always in Kelly’s stout arms, until she stood daringly on the flying board. For a moment the spray blinded her, but she soon learned to tilt her chin high into the wind and break its force, so that soon she was roaring across the reef, with a thundering surf at her feet and the powerful shape of Diamond Head dominating the shore.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How marvelous!” she cried as the comber maintained its rush toward the shore. Instinctively she drew Kelly’s arm closer about her, pressed backward against him and reveled in his manliness. Then, when the crashing surf broke at last, she felt the board collapse into the dying waves, and she with it, until she was underwater with Kelly’s arms still about her, and of her own accord she turned her face to his, and they kissed for a long time under the sea, then idly rose to the surface.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now she climbed back upon the surfboard, and with Kelly instructing, started the long paddle out to catch the next wave, but when their board was well separated from the others, she relaxed backwards until she felt herself against the beachboy once more, and there she rested in his secure arms, paddling idly as his adept hands began their explorations beneath her new bathing suit. Sighing, she whispered, “Is this part of the standard instruction?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not many wahine cute like you,” Kelly replied gallantly, whereupon she shivered with joy and brought her body closer to his, where she could feel the muscles of his chest against her neck .</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a long, exciting trip out to where the waves formed, and as they waited for the right one, Kelly asked, “You scared stand up dis time?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m game to try anything with you,” Rennie said, and she showed remarkable aptitude on the long surge in, and when the surfboard finally subsided into the broken wave, and when they were undersea for a kiss, she found to her surprise that her hands were now inside his swimming suit, clutching passionately, hungrily. When they surfaced, his black hair in his eyes like a satyr’s, he laughed and said approvingly, “Bimeby you numbah one surfer, get da trophy, Rennie.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do I do things right?” she asked modestly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You very right,” he assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we catch another wave?” she suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why we not go on up your room?” he asked evenly, keeping his dark eyes directly on her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think we’d better,” she agreed, adding cautiously, “Are you allowed upstairs?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“S’pose you forget your lauhala hat on de beach, somebody surely gotta bring it to you,” he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is that standard procedure?” Rennie asked coyly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like mos’ stuff,” Kelly explained, “surfin’s gotta have its own rules.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll play by the rules,” she agreed, squeezing his hand. And when he got to her room, holding the sun hat in his powerful hands, he found that she had already climbed into one of the skimpiest playsuits he had ever seen, and in his years on the beach he had seen quite a few.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hey, siesta! Wedder you wear muumuu or sundress or nuttin’, you look beautiful,” he said approvingly, and in her natural confusion over her divorce, this was exactly what she wanted to hear, and she dispensed with the customary formalities of such moments and held out her arms to the handsome beachboy.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Normally I’d order a Scotch and soda, and we’d talk a while . . . Let’s take up where we left off under water.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly studied her for a long, delicious moment and suggested, “Alla time, dese badin’ suit get wet too much.” And he slipped his off, and when, he stood before her in rugged, dark-skinned power she thought: “If I had married a man like this there’d have been no trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, as the parade passed down Bishop Street, she was about to leave Hawaii, and she held his hand tightly in the last minutes before boarding the Mouna Loa. For nine days she had lived with Kelly passionately and in complete surrender to his amazing manliness. Once she told him, “Kelly, you should have seen the pathetic little jerk I was married to. God, what a waste of years.” Now she whispered, in the bright sunlight, “If we hurried to the ship, would we have time for one more?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whassamatta why not?” he asked, and they clambered aboard the big ship and sought out her stateroom, but her intended roommate was already unpacking, a tall, rather good-looking girl in her late twenties. There were several embarrassed moments, after which Rennie whispered to Kelly, “What have I got to lose?”</p>

  <p class="normal">She addressed the girl directly and said, “I’m sorry we haven’t met, but would you think me an awful stinker if I borrowed the room for a little while?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall girl slowly studied Rennie and then Kelly. They were an attractive couple, and she laughed, “A vacation’s a vacation. How long you need?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“About half an hour,” Rennie replied. “They have a band upstairs.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And a full orchestra right here,” the girl laughed, and before she had climbed to the next deck, Rennie was undressed and in bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later she confided, “For five days I’ve been, imagining what it would be like to have you back in New York. How old are you, Kelly?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Twenty-one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Damn. I’m twenty-seven.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You no seem twenty-seven yet, not in bed,” the beachboy assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Am I good in bed?” she pleaded. “Really good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You numbah one wahine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you known many girls?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Surfin” is surfin’,” he replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For example, Maud Clemmens? Did you sleep with her?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How you like s’pose nex’ week somebody ast me, ‘How about Rennie? Dat wahine screw?’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelly! Such words!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Da whistle gonna blow, Rennie seestah,” he warned her, climbing into his own clothes.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I went down to the library, Kelly,” she said softly. “And there it was, like you said. This big long book with the names written down by the missionary. It says that your family can be traced back for one hundred and thirty-four generations. It must make you feel proud.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t make me feel notting,” Kelly grunted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why does a Hawaiian have the name Kelly?” she asked, slipping on her stockings.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My kanaka name Kelolo, but nobody like say ‘em.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelly’s a sweet name,” she said approvingly. Then she kissed him and asked, “Why wouldn’t you take me to your home?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s notting,” he shrugged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean, your ancestors were kings and you have nothing for yourself?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I get guitar, I get surfboard, I get cute wahine like you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s too damned bad,” she said bitterly, kissing him again. “Kelly, you’re the best thing in Hawaii.” They went on deck and she made a quick sign to her roommate, thanking her. The tall girl laughed and winked. When the whistle blew for the last time, warning the various beachboys who had come down to see their haole wahines off, Rennie asked hesitantly, “If some of my friends decide to come to Hawaii … girl friends that is . . .” She paused.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure, I look out for dem,” Kelly agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re a darling!” she laughed, kissing him ardently as he pulled away to run down the gangplank. In the departure shed the beachboy Florsheim--they called him that because sometimes he wore shoes --sidled up and asked, “Kelly blalah, da kine wahine da kine blonde, she good screwin’?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Da bes’,” Kelly said firmly, and the two beachboys went amiably back to the Lagoon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once or twice as the year 1946 skipped away, Kelly had fleeting doubts which he shared with Florsheim: “Whassamatta me? Takin’ care lotsa wahine, all mixed up. Where it gonna get me?” But such speculation was always stilled by the arrival of some new divorcee or widow, and the run of working it around so that he got into bed with them, while they paid the hotel and restaurant bills, was so great that he invariably came around to Florsheim’s philosophy: “Mo bettah we get fun now, while we young.” So he maintained the routine: meet the ship, find the girl that someone had cabled about, take her surfing, live with her for eight days, kiss her goodbye on the Moana Loa, get some rest, and then meet the next ship. Sometimes he looked with admiration at Johnny Pupali, forty-nine years old and still giving the wahines what he called “Dr. Pupali’s surfboard cure for misery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One afternoon he asked Pupali about his surprising energy, and the dean of beachboys explained: “A man got energy for do four t’ings. Eat, work, surf, or make love. But at one time got stuff for only two. For me, surfin’ and makin’ love.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You ever get tired?” Kelly asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Surfin’? No. I gonna die on an incomin’ wave. Wahines? Tell you da trufe, Kelly, sometime for about ten minutes after Moana Loa sail, I don’ neveh wanna see da kine wahine no ino’, but nex’ day wen anudder ship blow anudder whistle, man, I’m strip for action.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the lazy weeks between girls, Kelly found real joy in loafing on the beach with Florsheim, a big, sprawling man who wore his own kind of costume: enormous baggy shorts of silk and cotton that looked like underwear and fell two inches below his knees, a tentlike aloha shirt whose ends he tied about his middle, leaving a four-inch expanse of belly, Japanese slippers with a thong between his toes, and a coconut hat with a narrow brim and two long fibers reaching eight inches in the air and flopping over on one side. Florsheim always looked sloppy until he kicked off his clothes and stood forth in skintight bathing trunks, and then he looked like a pagan deity, huge, brown, long hair about his ears and a wreath of fragrant maile encircling his brow. Even the most fastidious mainland women reveled in this transformation and loved to lie on the sand beside him, tracing his rippling muscles with their red fingernails.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly preferred Florsheim as a companion because the huge beach-boy could sing the strange falsetto of the islands, and together they made a gifted pair, for Kelly had a fine baritone voice. He was also skilled at slack-key, a system of guitar playing peculiar to Hawaii, in which the strings were specially tuned to produce both plucked melody and strummed chords. Many people thought of Kelly’s slack-key as the voice of the islands, for when he was in good form he gave his music an urgent sweetness that no other possessed. The melodies were swift and tremulous like an island bird, but the chords were slow and sure like the thundering of the surf. When the beachboys had nothing to do, they often called, “Kelly blalah. Play da kine sleek-key like dat.” He was their troubadour, but he rarely played for visitors. “I doan’ like waste time haole,” he growled. “Dey doan’ know sleek-key.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The other pastime that he and Florsheim loved was sakura, a crazy Japanese card game played with little black cards that came in, a wooden box with a picture of cherry blossoms on the cover. Any beachboy was hailed as the day’s hero who could scrape together enough money to buy a fresh box of sakura cards, and through the long hot days the gang would sit beneath coconut umbrellas, playing the silly game. No other was allowed, and if a man couldn’t play sakura, he couldn’t be a beachboy. Of course he must also speak degenerate pidgin, as on the afternoon when Kelly was protesting the price of cube steak at the comer drug store.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Me t’ink high too much, da kine pipty cent,” he mused.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelly blalah, wha’ da kine da kine you speak?” Florsheim asked idly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whassamatta you, stoopid? You akamai good too much da kine da kine,” Kelly growled, adding with a chopping motion of his right hand, “Da kine chop chop.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh!” Florsheim sang in a high, descending wail of recognition. “You speak da fane da kine? Right, blalah, price too moch. Pipty cent too bloody takai.” And they passed to other equally important topics.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Kelly became better acquainted with American girls, he felt sorry for them. Invariably they confided how wretched their lives had been with their haole husbands, how the men were not interested in them and how unsatisfactory sex had been. This latter knowledge always astonished Kelly, for while the girls were with him they could think of little else, and if the world had women who were better at sex than the wahines who came over to Hawaii on the Moana Loa, he concluded they must be real tigers. One day he told Florsheim, “How some wahine gonna be any bettah than da kine wahine we get over heah? What you s’pose da mattah wid dese haole men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1947 he got a partial answer, because Florsheim married one of his young divorcees, a girl who had a lot of money and who gave him a Chevrolet convertible, and as long as they stayed in Hawaii things went rather well, but after three months in New York they broke all to hell, and Florsheim came back alone to resume his job on the beach. On a day when there was little doing he explained to his companions, “Dese wahine da kine, seem like dey two people. Over here on a surfboard dey relax, dey screw like mad, dey don’t gi’e a damn. Ova’ heah I t’row my wahine in da jalopy and we go okolehau.” He steered the imaginary car with his hands. “We have bes’ time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wha’ happen?” Kelly asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I tell you, Kelly blalah,” Florsheim drawled. “She take me New York, she no like da way I dress. She no like da kine talk, and she doan’ like one goddam t’ing, I t’ink. Allatime give me hell. No more time to’go bed in de apternoon, when it’s de bes’. So bimeby she tell me, ‘Florsheim, you gotta go night school learn speak haole no kanaka,’ and I tellem, ‘Go to hell. I ketchem airplane Hawaii,’ and she speak me, “Wha” you gonna use money da fcine?’ and I tellem, ‘Seven hunnerd dollars I scoop f’um you,’ and she speak, “You dirty boa’, you filthy mountain pig!’ and what I tellem den, I ain’t gonna repeat.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Da kine wahine turn out like dat?” Johnny Pupali mused. “Well, da’s why I tell you boys, ‘Screw ‘em but doan’ marry ‘em.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">Florsheim reflected: “Seem like dey good wahine ova’ heah, but anudder kine back home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You gonna keep da kine Chewy?” Kelly asked. “Yeah,” Florsheim said, adding, “I not halp so sorry for dem wahine like I was b’fore.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The sweet days rolled on and Kelly discovered what the older beachboys already knew: that the best wahines of all were those from the Deep South. They were gentler, kinder, and in memorable ways much more loving. They seemed fascinated by Kelly’s dark-brown body, and on three different occasions Kelly stayed for days at a time in one suite or another with some adorable girl from the South, without ever leaving the room and often without dressing from one day to the next. At mealtime he would throw a small towel about his waist, tucking in the ends as if it were a sarong, and the wahine from Montgomery or Atlanta or Birmingham would admire him as he lolled about the davenport. Once such a girl said, “You’re awfully close to a nigra, Kelly, and yet you aren’t. It’s fascinating.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hawaiians hate niggers,” Kelly assured her, and she felt better. “How do you make your living?” she asked softly, coming to lie beside him after the food had been pushed away. “S’pose I learn you surfin’, I get paid.” “You get paid for what you did on that surfboard?” she gasped. “Whassamatta, you no look you bill? Clerk put ‘im on dere.” “Do you get paid … for days like this?” ‘Clerk put ‘im on. Rules say I’m s’pose teachin’ you somethin’.” “That you are,” she said softly as they lapsed off into another nap. In time the girls he slept with became fused in his memory, for one sent another who sent another, but they always seemed to be the same girl, someone he had first met during the war. But there were a few whom he remembered forever. Once a young widow from Baton Rouge flew into the islands, and when he met her he calculated: “Dis wahine free nights da kine, maybe four.” He had underestimated, for in her sorrow the young woman would accept no man, yet when they stood in her cabin aboard the departing Moana Loa she said in a soft southern drawl, “The world is such a goddamned lonely place, Kelly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“S’pose you lose da kine man you love, I t’ink maybe so,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I never loved Charley,” she confessed, blowing her nose. “But he was a decent man, a good human being, and the world is worse off now that he’s gone.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you gonna do bimeby?” he asked her, lolling with one arm about the end of the bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” she said. “How old are you, Kelly?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I twenty-two, las’ week.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have your life ahead of you, Kelly. It should be so exciting. But never kid yourself, Kelly. The world is a very lonely place.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“People come, dey go,” he said philosophically.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But when a good one comes, hold onto the memory. It’s almost time for the whistle, and I wonder if I might do one thing before you go?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wha’ dat?” Kelly asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could I kiss you good-bye? You’ve been so kind and understanding.” She started to say something more, but broke into tears and pressed her beautiful white face to his. “You are such a goddamned decent human being,” she whispered. “More than anything in the world I needed to meet someone like you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Biting her lip and sniffling away her tears, she pushed him back toward the door and said, “Kelly, do you understand even remotely how deeply a woman like me prays for the success of a strong young man like you? I wish the heavens could open and give you their glory. Kelly, make a good life for yourself. Don’t be a bum. For you are one of the men whom Jesus loves.” And she sent him away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Often when the surf was breaking he contemplated her words and wondered how a man went about building a good life for himself. He suspected that it consisted neither in being an old stud horse like Johnny Pupali, fun though that was, nor in wasting one’s energies on a haole wife the way Florsheim had done. Yet all he knew how to do was lie in the sun, play slack-key and sakura, and teach wahines how to surf. So for the time being that had to be good enough.</p>

  <p class="normal">In late 1947 however a night-club singer from New York arrived in the islands—a two-night wahine, she turned out to be—and she took such a boisterous joy in Kelly that one night she cried, “God, they ought to build a monument to you, Beachboy!”</p>

  <p class="normal">She was outraged when she learned that the current popular song, “The Rolling Surf,” was something that Kelly had composed on the beach and had given away to whoever wanted it. A mainland musician had glommed onto it, added a few professional twists, and made a pile of money from it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You ought to sue the dirty bastard!” she yelled. Later she tested Kelly’s voice and found it good. “Tomorrow night, Kelly Kanakoa, you’re going to sing with me. In the dining room of the Lagoon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I no like singin’,” Kelly protested, but she asked, “What’s that lovely thing you and the falsetto boy were doing with your ukuleles?” “You speak da kine ‘Hawaiian Wedding Song’?” he asked. “The one where you start low, and he comes in high?” Casually, Kelly started singing “Ke Kali Ne Au,” the greatest of all Hawaiian songs, a glorious, haunting evocation of the islands. At the moment he was wearing a Lagoon towel as a sarong, with a hibiscus flower in his hair, and as he sang, the night-club girl sensed his full power and cried, “Kelly, nothing can stop you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">After one day’s rehearsal, for the girl was a real professional and learned quickly, Kelly Kanakoa, dressed in a red and white sarong, with one of his mother’s whale-tooth hooks dangling from a silver chain about his neck, and with a flower in his hair, came onto the floor of the Lagoon and started singing with the voice that was to become famous throughout the islands. “The Wedding Song” was unusual in that it provided a powerful solo for a baritone voice and a high, soaring dreamlike melody for a soprano. It was a true art song, worthy of Schubert or Hugo Wolf, and although that night’s audience had heard it often before, sung by blowzy baritones and worse sopranos, they had not really heard the full majesty of the lyric outcry. Kelly was a man in love, a muscular, bronzed god, and the slim blond girl from New York was in all ways his counterfoil. It was a memorable evening, and as it ended, the singer called to Kelly while he washed down in her shower, “How’d you like to come to New York with me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I doan’ leave da rock,” he called back.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You don’t have to marry me,” she assured him, aware before he was of his apprehensions. “Just sing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Me ‘n’ da beach, we akamai,” he said, and although she begged him several more times while they were in bed, he insisted that his place was in Hawaii. “See da kine wha’ hoppen Florsheim!” he repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, anyway,” she said as she dressed for the plane. “We taught one another a lot in a few days.” “You speak da trufe,” Kelly agreed. “You gonna keep on singing?” she asked. “Skoshi singin’, skoshi surfin’.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t give up the surfing,” she said sardonically. “You got a real good thing working for you there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Seestah, dis kanaka doan’ aim to lose it,” Kelly laughed. “I’m sure you don’t,” she cracked. She was brassy, and her hair was dark at the roots, but she was a good clean companion, and Kelly appreciated her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I ain’t able to come out to da airport,” he said apologetically. “You took care of things here,” she assured him, patting the bed, “and that’s where it counts.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, in early 1948, when the tourist business was beginning to boom, he received a cable from some wahine in Boston named Rennie, but he couldn’t remember who she was, but anyway she said, “<span>MEET MOANA LOA MRS</span>. <span>DALE HENDERSON</span>.” And when the ship came in, Florsheim, barefooted and staring up at the railing asked, “Which one you wahine, Kelly blalah?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe da kine,” he indicated with a shrug of his shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You s’pose she gonna lay?” Florsheim asked, appraising the slim, handsomely groomed girl who appeared to be in her early thirties.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She look maybe two nights, maybe four,” Kelly calculated, for he had found that women who spent unusual care on their appearance were often more tardy in climbing into bed than their sisters who called to the world, “Here I am, wind-blown and happy!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly, who like the other beachboys was privileged to climb aboard the Moana Loa before disembarkation started, elbowed his way along the crowded deck and touched Mrs. Henderson on the arm. She turned and smiled at him, a clean, unconfused greeting. When he shook hands with her he asked, “You name Dale or somethin’ else? Seem like nobody can’t speak man’s name, woman’s name no more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My name is Mrs. Henderson. Elinor Henderson,” she replied in the crisp and self-possessed voice of a New Englander. “I’m from Boston.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly very much wanted to ask, “Who dis Rennie wahine cable me? I no remember nobody in Boston.” But he didn’t speak. One rule he had learned in his beachboy business: never mention one woman to another, so that even though most of the customers he met had been referred to him by others, often intimate friends, he never mentioned that fact. Culling his brain furiously, he still failed to recall who Rennie was and he did not refer to her cable. But Mrs. Henderson did.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A college classmate of mine at Smith . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dat doan’ sound like no wahine college, Smith.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rennie Blackwell, she told me to be sure to look you up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Quickly Kelly composed his face as if he knew well who Rennie Blackwell was, and just as quickly Mrs. Henderson thought: “After all she told me, and he doesn’t even remember her name.” Wanting perversely to explore the situation further she added, “Rennie was the girl from Tulsa.” Still Kelly could not place her among the nameless girls that populated his life, and now he was aware that Mrs. Henderson was playing a game with him, so he lapsed into his most barbarous pidgin and banged his head with his fist. “Sometime I no akamai da kine. Dis wahine Rennie I not collect.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Henderson smiled and said, “She collects you, Kelly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was irritated with this secure woman and said, “S’pose one year, bimeby I say Florsheim, Cable here speak Elinor Henderson.</p>

  <p class="normal">Who dat one wahine? Florsheim he doan’ collect. I doan’ collect.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who’s Florsheim?” Elinor asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Da kine beachboy yonder ‘longside tall wahine,” Kelly explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Henderson laughed merrily and said, “Rennie told me you were the best beachboy in the business, but you must promise me one thing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wha’ dat?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You aren’t required to talk pidgin to me any longer. I’ll bet you graduated with honors from Hewlett Hall. You can probably speak English better than I can.” She smiled warmly and asked, “Aren’t you going to give me the lei?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m afraid to kiss you, Mrs. Henderson,” he laughed and handed her the flowers, but Florsheim saw this and rushed up, protesting, “Jeezus Crisss! Kanaka handin’ wahine flowers like New York?” He grabbed the lei, plopped it around Elinor’s head and kissed her powerfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Florsheim’s been in New York,” Kelly joked. “He knows how to act like a Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Florsheim? In New York?” Mrs. Henderson reflected, studying the huge beachboy with the long hair and the wreath of maile leaves. “I’ll bet the city’ll never be the same.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He married a society girl,” Kelly explained. “Stayed with her three months and came back. He got a Chevy convertible out of it. In fact, we’re riding back to the hotel in it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Florsheim’s girl from Kansas City hustled up, heavy with leis and mascara, and giggled: “My God! Aren’t these men positively divine?” She grabbed Florsheim’s dark brown arm, felt the muscles admiringly and asked, “You ever hit a man with that fist, Florsheim?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nevah,” the beachboy replied. “Only wimmin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His girl laughed outrageously, and when the various bits of luggage were piled into the Chewy, the two couples headed for the Lagoon, but when Florsheim drove up King Street and past the old mission houses, Elinor Henderson abruptly asked him to stop, and she studied the historic buildings carefully, explaining at last, “My great-great-grandmother was born in that house. Originally I was a Quigley.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never heard of them,” Kelly said honestly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They didn’t stay long. But I’m doing a biography of them . . . for my thesis. I teach at Smith, you know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You da kine wahine bimeby gonna write a book?” Florsheim asked, as he resumed the trip.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell him he doesn’t have to talk pidgin,” Elinor suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He can’t talk anything else,” Kelly laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think pidgin’s just adorable,” the girl in front said, and Kelly thought: “Looks like I’ve got a four-nighter at best, and maybe not at all, but good old Florsheim better watch out or he’s going to be layin’ that babe in the lobby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly’s suspicion about Elinor Henderson proved correct, for she was not a four-nighter or even a six. She loved surfing and felt secure in Kelly’s arms, but that was all. Yet one night when Kelly borrowed Florsheim’s convertible—for the Kansas City girl had said flatly, “Why go riding in a Chevy when you can have so much fun in bed?”—he drove Elinor out to Koko Head, where they sat in darkness talking.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the islands we call this kind of date, ‘Watching the midnight submarine races,’” he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Very witty,” she laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How’s the biography coming along?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m quite perplexed,” she confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No good, eh?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have been sorely tempted to put it aside, Kelly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long pause in the darkness as the late moon climbed out of the sea in the perpetual mystery of the tropics. Along the shore a coconut palm dipped out to meet it, and the night was heavy, bearing down on the world. Suddenly Elinor turned to Kelly and took his hands. “I have been driven mad by the desire to write about you, Kelly,” she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">The beachboy was astonished. “Me!” he cried. “What’s there to write about me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">She explained in clear, swift sentences, without allowing him to interrupt: “I have been haunted by Hawaii ever since I read my great-great-great-grandfather’s secret journal. He stayed here only seven years. Couldn’t take any more. And when he got back to Boston he wrote a completely frank account of his apprehensions. I can see his dear old handwriting still: ‘I shall write as if God were looking over my shoulder, for since He ordained these things He must understand them.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did he write?” Kelly inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He said that we Christians had invaded the islands with the proper God but with an improper set of supporting values. It was his conviction that our God saved the islands, but our ideas killed them. Particularly the Hawaiians. And at one point, Kelly, he wrote a prophetic passage about the Hawaiian of the future. I copied it down, and last night I read it again, and he was describing you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Gloomy prophecy?” Kelly asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">” The Hawaiian is destined to diminish year by year, dispossessed, distraught and confused.’ That’s what the old man wrote. He must have had you in mind, Kelly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly was twenty-three years old that night, and he realized that in Elinor Henderson he was mixed up with an entirely different kind of woman. She was thirty-one, he guessed, clean, honest and very appealing. He hair was crisply drawn back, and her white chin was both determined and inviting. He put his left hand under it and slowly brought it up to his. There was enough moonlight for him to see the visitor’s eyes, and he was captivated by their calm assurance, so that for some moments the missionaries’ descendant and the dispossessed Hawaiian studied each other, and finally his hand relaxed and her chin was released, whereupon she took his powerful face in her soft white hands and brought it to hers, kissing him and confessing, “I have forgotten old missionaries, Kelly. When I start to write I see only you. Do you know what I wish to call my new biography? The Dispossessed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They talked for a long time, while other cars came to observe the midnight submarine races and depart. Elinor asked directly, “Do you call this a life, Kelly? Making love to one neurotic divorcee after another?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who told you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can see Florsheim, can’t I?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Florsheim’s not me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That isn’t what Rennie Blackwell told me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did she tell you?” Kelly asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She said it was the one good week of her life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Which one was she?” he asked directly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I knew you didn’t remember. She was the one who told her roommate on the Moana Loa . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course! Look, I don’t have to be ashamed of loving a girl like that,” Kelly insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you suppose Florsheim’s going to marry the Kansas City girl?” Elinor asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s doing her damnedest to make him,” Kelly laughed. “He’ll stay with her four or five months and come home with a Buick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why haven’t you ever tried it?” Elinor probed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t need the money. I sing a little, play a little slack-key, get a little money teaching girls like you. And if I need a convertible, somebody always has one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is it a life?” Elinor asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly thought a long time, then asked, “What makes you think you can write a book?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can do anything I set my mind on,” Elinor replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How come you’re divorced?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your husband dead?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“One of the best, Kelly. One of the men God puts his special finger on.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He die in the war?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Covered with medals. Jack would have liked you, Kelly. You’d have understood each other. He had a thing about happiness. God, if the world knew what that man knew about being happy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They sat in silence for some time, and Kelly asked, “Why would you call your book The Dispossessed? I got everything I want.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You don’t have your islands. The Japanese have them. You don’t have the money. The Chinese have that. You don’t have the land. The Fort has that. And you don’t have your gods. My ancestors took care of that. What do you have?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly laughed nervously and began to say something but fought back the impulse, for he knew it would lead to peril. Instead he wagged his finger in Elinor’s face and said, “You’d be surprised at what we Hawaiians have. Truly, you’d be astounded.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right. Take the four pretty girls who do the hula at the Lagoon … in those fake cellophane skirts. What are their names? Tell me the truth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, the one with the beautiful legs is Gloria Ching.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Chinese?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Plus maybe a little Hawaiian. The girl with the real big bosom, that’s Rachel Fernandez. And the real beauty there … I sort of like her, except she’s Japanese . . . that’s Helen Fukuda, and the one on the end is Norma Swenson.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Swedish?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Plus maybe a little Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So what we call Hawaiian culture is really a girl from the Philippines, wearing a cellophane skirt from Tahiti, playing a ukulele from Portugal, backed up by a loud-speaker guitar from New York, singing a phony ballad from Hollywood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not a phony Hawaiian,” he said carefully. “In the library there’s a book about me. More than a hundred generations, and when I sing a Hawaiian song it comes right up from my toes. There’s lots you don’t know, Elinor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell me,” she persisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” he refused. Then abruptly he made the surrender which only a few minutes earlier he had recognized as perilous. “I’ll do better . . . something I’ve never done before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll see. Wear something cool and I’ll pick you up about three tomorrow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will it be exciting?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Something you’ll never forget.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At three next day he drove a borrowed car up to the Lagoon and waited idly in the driveway till she appeared. When she got into the Pontiac, crisp and cool in a white dress, he turned toward the mountains and drove inland from the reef until he came to a high board fence, behind which coconut palms rose in awkward majesty. He continued around the fence until he came to a battered gate which he opened by nosing the car against it. When he had entered the grounds, he adroitly backed the car into the gate and closed it. Then he raced the engine, spun the tires in gravel, and brought the car up to a shadowy, palm-protected, weather-stained old wooden house built in three stories, with gables, wide verandas, fretwork and stained-glass windows.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is my home,” he said simply. “No girl’s ever been here before.” He banged the horn, and at the rickety screen door appeared a marvelous woman, six feet two inches tall, almost as wide as the door itself, silver-haired and stately, and with a great brown smile that filled her plastic face. “Is that you, Kelolo?” she asked in a perfectly modulated voice that contained a touch of New England accent.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hi, Mom. Prepare for a shock! I’m bringing’ home a haole wahine.” Lest his mother be aware of the changes he had undergone for this girl, Kelly lapsed into his worst pidgin.</p>

  <p class="normal">His mother left the doorway, walked in stately fashion to the edge of the porch, and extended her hand: “We are truly delighted to welcome you to the Swamp.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Muddah, dis wahine Elinor Henderson, Smith. Muddah’s Vassar.” The trim Bostonian and the huge Hawaiian shook hands, each respectful of the other, and the latter said in her soft voice, “I am Malama Kanakoa, and you are the first of Kelolo’s haole friends he has ever brought here. You must be special.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Eh, Muddah, watch out!” Kelly warned. “We not in love. Dis wahine mo eight years older dan me. She all fixed mo bettah in Boston.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But she is special,” Malama insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Special too much! She gotta brain da kine, akamai too good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The trio laughed and each instinctively felt at ease with the other. Kelly helped by explaining, “Muddah, dis wahine she come from long-time mission pamily Quigley. I not speak dis pamily, but maybe you do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Immanuel Quigley!” Malama cried, taking her visitor’s two hands. “He was the best of the missionaries. Only one who loved the Hawaiians. But he stayed only a short time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think he transmuted all his love for Hawaii into his children, and I inherited it,” Elinor said. She saw that she had entered a nineteenth-century drawing room, complete with chandelier, tiered crystal cases, an organ, a Steinway piano and a brown mezzotint of Raphael’s “Ascent of the Virgin” in a massive carved frame. The ceiling was enormously high, which made the room unexpectedly cool, but Elinor was distracted from this fact by an object which hung inside an inverted glass bowl set in a mahogany base. “Whatever is it?” she cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s a whale’s tooth,” Malama explained. “Formed into a hook.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what’s it hung on?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Human hair,” Kelly assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama interrupted, removing the glass cover and handing her visitor the precious relic. “My ancestor, the King of Kona, wore this when he fought as Kamehameha’s general. Later he wore it when the first mission ship touched at Lahaina. I suppose that every hair in this enormous chain came from the head of someone my family cherished.” She replaced the glass cover. Then she said, “Kelly, while you show Mrs. Henderson why we call this the Swamp, I’ll be getting tea. Some of the ladies are coming in.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Kelly took Elinor to the rear of the house, through a kitchen that had once prepared two hundred dinners for King Kalakaua, and soon they were in a fairyland of trees and flowers bordering a rash-lined swamp whose surface was covered with lilies. With some irony Kelly said, dropping his pidgin now that he was again alone with Elinor, “This was the only land the haoles didn’t take. Now it’s worth two million dollars. But of course Mom takes care of a hundred poor Hawaiians, and she’s in hock up to her neck.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To Elinor, the scene of old decay was poignant, and as red-tufted birds darted through the swamp and perched on the tips of dancing reeds, she saw the complete motif for her biography. “You really are The Dispossessed,” she mused, fusing reality with her vision of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, I think you have it wrong, Kelly protested. “This is the walled-in garden that every Hawaiian knows, for he tends one in his own heart. Here no one intrudes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you’re contemptuous of the haole girls you sleep with?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, No! Sleeping is fun, Elinor. That’s outside what we’re talking about.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re right, and I apologize. What I meant was, insofar as they’re haoles, you’re contemptuous of them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelly thought about this for a long time, tossed a pebble at a swaying bird, and said, “I don’t believe I would admit that. I’m not as intolerant as the missionaries were.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Immanuel Quigley said almost the same thing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think I would have liked old Quigley,” Kelly admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He was young when he served here. He became old in Ohio. What a profound man he was.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mom s probably ready,” Kelly suggested, and he led Elinor away from the swamp and back into the spacious drawing room, where four gigantic Hawaiian women, gray-haired and gracious, waited.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is Mrs. Leon Choy,” Malama said softly. “And this is Mrs. Hideo Fukuda.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did I see your very pretty daughter dancing at the Lagoon?” Elinor inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the huge woman replied, bowing slightly and beaming with pleasure. “Helen loves to dance, as I did when I was younger.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And this is Mrs. Liliha Mendonca,” Malama continued. “Her husband owned the taxi company. And this poor little dwarf over here is Mrs. Jesus Rodriques,” Malama laughed. Mrs. Rodriques was only five feet nine and weighed less than 190. “I’ve told the ladies that Mrs. Henderson is a descendant of dear old Immanuel Quigley. We hold him very warmly in our hearts, Elinor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m surprised you’re not staying with the Hales or the Whipples,” Mrs. Mendonca said. “They came over on the same ship with your grandfather, or whatever he was.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our families were never close,” Elinor explained. Each of the five Hawaiian women wanted desperately to explore this admission, but they were too well-bred to do so, and after a while Malama suggested, “I’m sure Mrs. Henderson would like to hear some of the old songs,” and soon she had scraped together a couple of ukuleles and two guitars. The stately Hawaiian women preferred standing while they sang, and now along one edge of the room they formed a frieze of giants, and after a few preliminary plunks on their instruments, launched into a series of the most cherished Hawaiian melodies. They seemed like a professional chorus, so easily did their voices blend. Mrs. Choy, with marvelous darting eyes and gamin manner, sang the high parts, while Mrs. Rodriques and Mrs. Mendonca boomed massive chords that paved the musical structure. Each song contained dozens of verses, and as the last chords of one verse lingered in the air, Mrs. Fukuda in a singsong falsetto enunciated the first words of the next. She owned a prodigious memory, and the other ladies did not enjoy singing unless she was along, for her monotonous setting of the next theme gave them much pleasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dusk came over the Swamp and lamps were lit. The huge women, reminiscent of bygone splendors, stayed on, and Elinor listened enraptured to their soft conversation until Kelly interrupted brusquely and said, “I speak one kanaka play a little sleek-key tinnight Da wahine ‘n’ me be goin’.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when the women saw him about to leave, Mrs. Choy began casually humming the first bars of the “Hawaiian Wedding Song,” so that Kelly stopped in the shadows by the door, and while light from the chandelier reflected upon him in variegated colors, he started softly into the great flowing passage of love. His voice was in excellent form, and he allowed it to expand to its fullest. When the time came for him to halt, Elinor wondered which of the five women would pick up the girl’s part, and it was Malama. Standing vast like a monument with silvery hair, she soared into the sweeping lyric portion of the song, and after a while mother and son combined in the final haunting duet. It was an unusually fortunate rendition, and as the lingering chords died away, Mrs. Choy banged her ukulele several times and cried, “I could sing this way all night.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kelly and Elinor were back in the borrowed car he said, “They will, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Elinor asked, “When your mother came back from Vassar, what did she do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the hot afternoons she sang, and was good to the Hawaiians, and wasted her money. What else?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Elinor began sniffling, and after a while said, “I’m bitterly tangled up, Kelly. I can’t go back to the hotel.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have to sing,” he said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you get paid for it?” she asked between sniffles.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not tonight. For a friend.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You lousy, defeated, wonderful people,” she said. “Okay, take me back. For a friend you must do everything.” She slumped against the door, then quickly jumped back beside Kelly. ‘Tell me, has this friend, as you call him, ever done anything for you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mmmmmm, well, no.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So you sing your life away? For nothing?” “Who’s happier?” he countered. “Mom or the women you know back home?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Early next morning Elinor Henderson reported at the library and asked Miss Lucinda Whipple for “that book which gives the genealogy of the Kanakoas.” At this request Miss Whipple masked her contempt and studied Kelly’s latest sleeping partner, for she had found that over the course of a year at least half a dozen awestruck haole women, who by their ignorance of card catalogues proved they rarely saw a library, could be counted upon to ask for “that book about Kelly Kanakoa.” Miss Whipple guessed that one girl probably told the next, for they appeared at regular intervals, and when they reverently returned the book, some gasped, “Gosh, his grandfather was a real king!” Miss Whipple never commented, but she did observe that with such women apparently the farthest back they could imagine was grandfather. Beyond that all was obscurity.</p>

  <p class="normal">But this girl proved to be different. When she completed studying the long tables in the Missionary Museum publication, she asked Miss Whipple, “What authority substantiates this?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Miss Whipple replied, “My great-grandfather, Abner Hale, transcribed this remarkable document from verbal traditions recited by a kahuna raid on Maui. A great deal of research has been done in both Tahiti and Hawaii, and the account seems to check out at most points.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many years do you accord each generation?” Mrs. Henderson asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suppose we ought to follow the dictionary and allot each one thirty years, but we feel that in a tropical climate, and judging from what we know to be true, twenty-two years is a safer estimate. Then too, you will detect that what the genealogy calls two successive generations is often really one, for it was a case of brother succeeding brother rather than son succeeding father. By the way, you seem to have a substantial knowledge of Hawaii. May I ask what your interest is?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am the great-great-great-granddaughter of Immanuel Quigley,” Elinor explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, my goodness!” Miss Whipple said in a flurry. “We’ve never had a Quigley here before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Elinor said evenly. “As you know, my father had difficulties.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Recollection of old and bitter events did not diminish Lucinda Whipple’s ardor, for her genealogical interests transcended unpleasantness, and she asked excitedly, “Shall you be in Honolulu on Saturday?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Elinor replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Goodness, how wonderful!” Miss Whipple said. “It’s the yearly anniversary of the missionaries’ arrival, and I would be truly honored if you would accompany me. Imagine! A Quigley!” She went on to explain that each spring throughout her life she had attended the yearly meeting of the Mission Children’s Society, and as the roll was called she had dutifully, and proudly, stood up for John Whipple, Abner Hale and Abraham Hewlett, each of whom had figured in her ancestry, as well as for the collateral line of Retire Janders, who, while not a missionary, had served with them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we have never had anyone rise to honor the name of Quigley. Please, do come!”</p>

  <p class="normal">So on a hot Saturday in April, Elinor Henderson sat among the mission offspring and sang the opening hymn, “From Greenland’s icy mountains.” When the exciting moment came to call the roll of those long-dead and honorable men and women who had served God in the islands, she felt a mounting excitement as the descendants of each couple rose. “Abner Hale and his wife Jerusha, brig Thetis, 1822,” read the clerk, and there was a flurry of chairs pushing back, after which a varied crew of Hales stood at attention while the rest applauded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dr. John Whipple and his wife Amanda, brig Thetis, 1822,” the clerk intoned, and from the scraping, Elinor concluded that Dr. John must have been an unusually potent young medico, for many rose to honor him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Immanuel Quigley and his wife Jeptha, brig Thetis, 1822,” called the clerk, and with a heart bursting with passion and history and the confused love of God, Elinor Henderson rose, the first Quigley ever to have done so in that society. Her rising must have inflamed bitter memories in the hearts of the Hales and the Hewletts and the Whipples, for although intractable Immanuel Quigley had suppressed his secret memoirs, which Elinor had found so damning, he had allowed enough of his ideas to escape so that his name was not a happy one among the mission families. Defiantly, his great-great-great-granddaughter stared ahead, and then she heard from the assembly a hammering of palms and wild applause. Continuing to stare ahead, for she was no more forgiving than her difficult ancestor had been, she resumed her seat as the clerk cried mournfully, “Abraham and Urania Hewlett, brig Thetis, 1822.” Again there was a loud scraping of chairs, with many Hawaiians standing, for Abraham’s offspring by Malia, his second wife, were numerous. Many of the missionary descendants considered it inappropriate for such people to rise as if they were the true descendants of blessed Urania Hewlett, but the Hawaiians got up anyway and nothing could be done about it.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Elinor Henderson told Kelly, “A visitor touches Hawaii at great risk. He never knows when the passions of the islands will engulf him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You think you know enough now to write the biography?” Kelly asked idly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You determined to call it The Dispossessed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“More than ever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who do you think the dispossessed are?” Kelly taunted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You. Who else?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought maybe at the mission society you discovered that they were the real dispossessed,” he argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you mean?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They came here to bring Congregationalism, but we despised their brand of Christianity. Now most of us are Catholics or Mormons. Today we have nearly as many Buddhists in the islands as Congregationalists. Likewise, they came with a God they believed in. How many of them still have that God? And they had big ideas. Now all they have is money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You sound very bitter, Kelly. And in a way I’m glad.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know why the Mormons had so much success in these islands? They admit frankly. ‘In heaven there are only white people.’ I suppose you know that a nigger can’t get a place to sleep in Salt Lake. So they tell us that if we are real good on earth and we love God, when we die God’s going to make us white, and then we’ll go to heaven and all will be hunky-dory.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t believe Mormons think that, Kelly,” she protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It squares with the facts,” he said carefully, but his anger was rising furiously and he was afraid of what he might say next. He tried to halt his words, but in spite of himself they rushed out: “Of course, the other Christians tell us that God loves all men, but we know that’s bullshit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelly!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We know it! We know it!” he stormed. “It’s as clear as the mountains at dawn. God loves first white men, then Chinese, then Japanese, and after a long pause He accepts Hawaiians.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelly, my darling boy, please!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But do you know the one consolation we got? Can you guess? We know for goddamn certain that He loves us better than He loves niggers. God, I’d hate to be a nigger.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Since Elinor Henderson had greater capacity for emotion than for logical control she was, of course, unable to write her book; in fact, she was prevented from even trying by one of those strange, wild occurrences that mark the tropics. At six-eighteen on the morning following her visit to the mission society she was still asleep, but in the deep waters of the Pacific, nearly three thousand miles to the north, an event of tremendous magnitude was taking place. The great shelf that lies off the Aleutian Chain was racked by a massive submarine earthquake, which in the space of a few minutes tumbled millions of tons of submerged ocean cliff down hidden mountainsides to a new resting place on the ocean floor. It was a titanic redisposal of the earth’s crust, and the ocean in whose depths it occurred, was shaken so violently that a mighty rhythmic wave was launched southward at an incomprehensible speed; but even though something like seven per cent of the entire ocean was affected, the resulting wave was physically inconspicuous, never more than four or five inches high.</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, one shipload of sailors passed right over it without knowing, for at seven-eighteen that morning a slight swell lifted a Japanese tanker some three inches higher than it had been a moment before, but no one noticed the event and it was not recorded in the log. But if the captain had been alert, and if he had known where the wave had originated only an hour before, he could have written: “Tsunami caused by an Alaskan submarine earthquake passed under our ship. Speed southward, 512 miles an hour.” And if he had thought to flash a radio warning throughout the Pacific many lives would have been saved, but he neither saw nor thought, so the epic tsunami sped on unheralded at a speed approaching that of sound. If it encountered no stationary objects like islands, it would ultimately dissipate itself in the far Antarctic, but if it did come upon an island, its kinetic energy might pile waters more than seventy feet deep upon the land and then suck them back out to sea with demonic force. The coming in of the waters would destroy little, but their awful retreat would carry away all things.</p>

  <p class="normal">While the tsunami was passing unnoticed under the Japanese tanker, Elinor Henderson was just rising to enjoy the last effects of dawn over the Pacific, and at nine she went down to the beach to watch the beachboys playing sakura. She was amused to hear them swearing in pidgin when the run of the black cards went against them, but this morning had a special attraction in that Florsheim appeared among the boys dressed in store clothes: polished tan shoes, a suit that was not quite big enough for his huge frame, a shirt that bound a little at the collar, a knitted tie that hung awry and a tropical straw hat. Beside him stood the rich girl from Kansas City, hardly able to keep her hands off him and crying to one group after another, “God, ain’t he a hunk of man? We’re gettin’ married in St. Louis.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Florsheim grinned and handed his Chewy keys to Elinor: “You, seestah, tell blalah Kelly take care my jalopy.” She said she would, and when she saw Kelly she asked, “How long do you think Florsheim’ll stay married this time?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Seem like blalah Florsheim gonna look funny Kansas City da kine. So bimeby dis wahine gonna find he doan’ talk so good and she gonna gi’e him lotta wahine pilikia. So come late October you gonna see blalah Florsheim back on de beach wid a Buick convertible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This time it’ll be a Cadillac! Want to bet?” She laughed and then an idea came to her: “Kelly! As long as we have the car, why don’t we go on a picnic?” She insisted upon buying all the food, and at ten o’clock, when the tsunami was less than six hundred miles from Oahu, she pointed to a snug little valley on the north shore of the island and cried, “They saved this sandy beach for us!” And Kelly spread their blankets under a palm tree.</p>

  <p class="normal">They went swimming, and when they were drying in the sun, Elinor said, “I’m going to leave Hawaii, Kelly. Don’t speak. I’m falling in love with you, and I’m not the kind of woman who goes around robbing cradles.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m old enough to teach you a lot,” Kelly protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would never marry you, Kelly . . . eight years younger than I am. And I will not contribute to your delinquency.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We could have a wonderful time,” he insisted, pulling her toward him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think it’s immoral when a girl gets involved with a man she has no possibility of marrying. It’s disgraceful, the way girls use you, Kelly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He fell silent, then started pitching pebbles at a nearby rock. Finally he said, “If you ever go to another island, Mrs. Henderson, don’t ask so many deep questions. Take it as it is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll stay away from islands,” she promised. “I wanted to see why my ancestors couldn’t stomach this one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you find out?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, and I can’t stand it either.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” he asked drowsily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I always side with the dispossessed. You know, Immanuel Quigley got into great trouble in Ohio, aiding the Indians.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sorry I wrecked your book about Quigley. Will they be angry … at Smith?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The biography of one man is the biography of all men,” she said. “In the passage of time, Kelly, we all become one person.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you honestly think a kanaka like me is as good as a haole like you?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was once taught that if a pebble falls in the Arabian desert, it affects me in Massachusetts. I believe that, Kelly. We are forever interlocked with the rest of the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She saw that he was sleepy, so she cradled his sun-browned shoulders in her lap, and he asked for his guitar so that he might play a little slack-key, and he picked out melodies that spoke of the sun-swept seashores that he loved. After a while the guitar fell from his hands, and he dozed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Elinor, watching the panorama of sandy beach and palm trees, studied with interest what she thought was the changing of the tide, for the ocean waters seemed to be leaving the shore, until at last they stood far out to sea disclosing an emptier reef than any she had seen before, and she watched certain prominent puddles in which large fish, suddenly stranded, were whipping their tails in an attempt to escape. She began to laugh, and Kelly, forgetting where he was, asked drowsily, “Whassamatta you laff?” And she explained, “There’s a fish trapped in a pool.” And he asked, “How da heck he stuck in dis …”</p>

  <p class="normal">In horror he leaped up, saw the barren reef and the withdrawn waters. “Oh, Christ!” he cried in terror. “This is a big one!” He grabbed her in his strong arms and started dashing across the sand, past the useless Chevy convertible and on toward higher land, but his effort was useless, for from the tormented sea the great tsunami that had sucked away the waters to feed its insatiable wave, now rushed forward at more than five hundred miles an hour.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not a towering wave but its oncoming force was incredible. It filled the reef. It kept coming relentlessly, across the sand, across the roads, across the fields. In low areas it submerged whole villages, but if it was not constricted and could spread out evenly, its destruction was moderate. However, when it was compressed into a narrowing wedge, as at the mouth of a valley, it roared in with accumulating fury until at last it stood more than seventy feet higher than along its accustomed shore.</p>

  <p class="normal">In its first tremendous surge inward it trapped Kelly Kanakoa and Mrs. Henderson in their snug valley. It did not whip them about, like on ordinary breaker, for it was not that kind of wave; it merely came on and on. and on, bearing them swiftly inland until Kelly, who knew how awful the outgoing rush would be, shouted, “Elinor! Grab hold of something!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Vainly she grabbed at bushes, at trees, at corners of houses, but the implacable wave swept her along, and she could hold nothing. “Grab something!” he pleaded. “When the wave sucks back out . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was struck in the neck by a piece of wood and started to sink, but she caught him and kept his head above the rushing waters. How terrifying they were, as they came on with endless force. She was swept past the last house in the village and on up into the valley’s tight confines, the most dangerous spot in the entire island from which to fight a retreating tsunami, for now the waters began to recede, slowly at first, then with speed and finally with uncontrollable fury.</p>

  <p class="normal">She last saw Kelly almost unconscious, hanging instinctively to a kou tree upon whose branches she had placed his hands. She had tried to catch something for herself, too, but the waters were too powerful. At increasing speed she was sucked back over the route she had come, past the broken houses and the crushed Chevy and the reef she had seen so strangely bare. As the last stones whipped past she thought: “This cursed island!” And she thought no more.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the drowsy life of the beachboy drifted from day to day, from week into week, and then into sleepy sun-swept months; the years of sand and sea crept on. In late November, when Florsheim drove his new Pontiac convertible off the Moana Loa and up to his old stand at the Lagoon, Kelly thought: “I wish I could tell Mrs. Henderson that it was neither a Buick nor a Cadillac,” and the old hurt returned.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the Swamp his mother Malama sang in the late afternoons with her Hawaiian friends: Mrs. Choy, Mrs. Fukuda, Mrs. Mendonca and Mrs. Rodriques, and they were never again bothered by Kelolo and his haole girls. For the most part he kept strictly to the Lagoon, where he sang a little, played some slack-key, and got a lot of cables. In time he found great consolation in Johnny Pupali’s summary of sex: “It’s the greatest thing in the world. You never get enough until you’ve just had some.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Once Florsheim remarked: “Kelly blalah, I t’ink dis one t’ing berry punny.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wha’ dat?” Kelly asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Allatime New York dey got pitchas wid’ colors ‘Come to Hawaii!’ An’ dey show dis rock wid wahines, grass skirts, flowahs in de hair, wigglin’ de hips like to speak, ‘You come to Hawaii, mister, we gonna screw till you dizzy.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ain” nuttin’ wrong wid dat,” Kelly reflected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But de punny t’ing, Kelly blalah, it ain’ so easy to ketch a wahine on dis rock. It ain’ dem mainland kanakas has de good time ovah heah, it’s de wahines. You know what I fink, blalah?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You speak.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I t’ink mo bettah dey get you ‘n’ me on de pitchas.” And he fell into an exaggerated pose, his muscles flexed, his dark eyes staring out to sea past Diamond Head, and he made an ideal travel poster. Relaxing with laughter he yelled, “Kelly blalah, we de real attraction.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later when Kelly was locked in a room with a red-hot divorcee from Los Angeles her father arrived unexpectedly and banged on the door, shouting, “Betty! I don’t want you wrecking your life with any beachboy bum.” But Kelly slipped out through a side hallway, so no real damage was done.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN</span> Shig Sakagawa landed at Yokohama in early 1946, he studied his ancestral homeland with care, and when he saw the starving people, the bombed-out cities and the pathetic material base from which the Japanese had aspired to conquer the world, he thought: “Maybe Pop’s right, and this is the greatest country on earth, but it sure don’t look it.” In his first letter home he tried to report faithfully what he was seeing, but when Kamejiro heard it read, he sent his son a stern reply which said: “Remember that you are a good Japanese, Shigeo, and do not say such things about your homeland.” After that Shig wrote mostly generalities.</p>

  <p class="normal">His first days in Japan were tremendously exciting, for the bustle of Tokyo was reviving, and hordes of little workmen, each of whom looked like his father, scrambled over the bombed ruins, cleaning up as they went. Shig had never before seen such national vitality, and in time he became impressed with Japan’s unconquerable resilience. Along the streets he saw innumerable elderly women like his own mother, wearing baggy canvas pants, and they worked harder than, the men, lugging away big baskets of rubble. Almost while he watched, Tokyo was cleaned up and prepared for a new cycle of life. “I have to admire such people,” he wrote to his father, and old Kamejiro liked this letter better than the disloyal one that had reflected upon Japan’s defeat.</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig took great interest in his work as a translator for the Harvard professor whom General MacArthur had brought over to advise the Occupation on land reform. Dr. Abernethy was a curious, lanky man of most acute insights, and although he had to depend upon Captain Sakagawa for actual translations of what the Japanese farmers told him, he relied ultimately upon his own perceptions, and for the first time in his life Shig was able to study at close hand a refined human mind at work. A rice farmer would tell Shig, “I have two hundred and forty tsubo for paddy,” and Shig would translate this for Dr. Abernethy, but the latter seemed hardly to be listening, for he was surveying the land himself and judging its productive quotient; so that almost before either Shig or the farmer spoke, Dr. Abernethy knew what the land was worth, and if Shig’s translated evidence contradicted his, Shig had to reconcile the facts, and usually Abernethy was right.</p>

  <p class="normal">On long jeep trips through the countryside, while Shig drove, Abernethy expounded his theories of land reform. “What General MacArthur’s up against here, Shig, is a classic medieval concept of land ownership. In each area half a dozen wealthy men control the land and parcel out portions of it according to their own economic interests. That’s not a bad system, really. Certainly it’s a lot better than communism. But where the trouble comes is when personal economic interests, usually of an arbitrary nature, override national survival interest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like what?” Shig asked, finding deep pleasure in Abemethy’s willingness to talk to him on a mature, adult level. It was hell when well-meaning colonels insisted upon speaking pidgin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, like when a landowner in an area that needs more food holds back his land for other speculation, or doesn’t use it at all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does this happen?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look around you! It’s obvious that even during Japan’s war for survival this landowner held his lands back. When such a thing occurs, to save your nation you ought to have a revolution. Throughout history that’s been the inevitable concomitant of abusive land ownership. Fortunately, a land revolution can develop in either of two ways. In France the land was held so irrationally that the French Revolution was required before the whole rotten system could be swept away . . . with great loss of life. That’s the poorest kind of revolution. In England, the same result was accomplished by taxation. In time the huge landholders simply couldn’t hang onto their land any longer. Taxes were too high. So they were forced to sell, and so far as I know not a single human life was lost. That’s the logical way to accomplish land reform.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You think Japan faces the same problem as France and England?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All nations do,” Abernethy said as they bounced along a rocky road in Shiba Prefecture. “The relationship of man to his land is simple and universal. Every nation began with land evenly distributed among producers. As a result of superior mentality or manipulative skill, able landlords begin to acquire large holdings, in which society confirms them. As long as there is no great pressure of population, these great holders are allowed to do pretty much as they wish. But when families multiply, their marriageable sons begin to look longingly at the expanse of idle land. For the moment all the conventions of society, religion, politics and custom support the large landholders, and in most nations those peasants who make the first protests are hanged. Here in Japan, when the first agitators asked for land, they were crucified, upside down. Later the pressures become greater, and you have a bloody revolution . . . unless you’re smart, like the English, and then you accomplish the same end by adroitly applied taxes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you think this cycle operates in all nations?” Shig pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I myself have witnessed five such revolutions at close hand. In Mexico the offenses against common sense were unbelievable, and so were the bloody reprisals. In England a smart bunch of legislators effected the change-over with marvelous simplicity. In Rumania the blood was ugly to see. Also Spain. In the western United States the cattlemen started to protect their immoral holdings with gunfire, but in time the common sense of the townspeople, applied through taxation, defeated them. No nation can avoid land reform. All it can do is determine the course it will take: bloody revolution or taxation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It seems to me that here in, Japan we have a third choice. Land reform by fiat.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course,” Abernethy quickly agreed. “What you and I finally decide to order done, General MacArthur will do, and it’ll turn out to be his greatest accomplishment in Japan. For it will distribute land equitably and at the same time prevent a bloody revolution.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then there really is a third alternative?” Shig pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Abernethy replied, “but few nations are lucky enough to lose a war to the United States.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They drove in silence for more than two miles, looking for a country lane that led to the headquarters of one of the most illogical of the large land holdings that had imperiled Japan, and when they spotted the turning, Shig studied the relatively small area involved—small, that is, as compared with Hawaii—and he began to laugh. “What’s the joke?” his lanky, dour companion asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was thinking how ironic it is!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” Abernethy asked, for he loved the ironies of history.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Here we are, you and I, doing all this work in redistributing farm lands in defeated Japan, while, actually, the situation in my own home, Hawaii, is far worse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Abernethy sat with his knees hunched up toward his chin and waited silently till Shig looked at him. The he smiled slyly and asked, “What do you suppose I’ve been talking to you about?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig was so startled that he slowed down the jeep, brought it to a complete halt, and turned formally to look at his commander. “You mean you’ve been talking to me about Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course. I want you to appreciate what the alternatives are.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you know anything about Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Anyone interested in land reform knows Hawaii. Now that Hungary and Japan have faced their revolutions, Hawaii and China remain the most notorious remnants of medievalism in the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will both have to undergo revolutions?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course,” Abemethy replied simply. “The hardest lesson in all history to learn is that no nation is exempt from history. China’s revolution will probably end in bloody confiscation. Hawaii’s will probably be accomplished by peaceful taxation.” He paused and asked, “That is, if smart young fellows like you have any sense.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I still think it’s sardonic that I should be over here helping to save Japan,” Shig reflected. “I should be doing this same job at home.” He shifted gears and headed for the small house where the nervous Japanese landlords waited.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As I said,” Dr. Abernethy repeated dourly, “few nations are lucky enough to lose wars at the right time. Lucky Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This fact was hammered home when Shig finally overtook his older brother Goro, who served as translator in General MacArthur’s labor division. He had been in Nagoya when Shig landed, working on a long-range program for the unionization of Japanese industry, but instead of serving a quiet intellectual theorist like Dr. Abernethy of Harvard he was with a team of red-hot American labor organizers from the A.F. of L. “This job is driving me crazy!” stocky Goro cried, rubbing his crew-cut stubble.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are the people you work for stupid?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Stupid! They’re the smartest characters I ever met. What drives me nuts is that I work fifteen hours a day forcing Japanese into labor unions. I read them General MacArthur’s statement that one of the strongest foundations of democracy is an organized laboring class, secure in its rights. And you know, I think MacArthur is right. It’s the only way Japan will ever be able to combat the zaibatsu. Strong, determined unions. But by God it’s maddening to be forcing onto the Japanese in Japan what the Japanese in Hawaii are forbidden to have.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean unions?” Shig asked, as they drank Japanese beer in the Dai Ichi Hotel, where they were bunked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re damned right I mean unions!” Goro fumed. “Let’s be honest, Shig. We practically fought a war to eliminate the zaibatsu in Japan. But you know the big firms here never controlled half as much as they do in Hawaii. You know, Shig, it’s a crazy world when you fight a war to give the conquered what you refuse to give your own people back home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig took refuge in a trick he often used when trying to think straight. He stopped talking and held his beer stein to his lips for a long time, but Goro used this interval to comment: “If unions are good in Japan, they’re good in Hawaii. If the zaibatsu are bad in Japan, they’re bad in Hawaii. Yet I’m forced to make the Japanese join unions here, and if I tried to do the identical thing in Hawaii I’d be arrested, beaten up, and thrown into jail. How bloody crazy can you get?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you say is fascinating,” Shig volunteered slowly. “The man I’m working for, this Dr. Abemethy, says exactly the same thing about the land problems. Only he always adds, ‘A nation is lucky when it loses a war at the right time.’ The more I look at what we’re doing for Japan, the more I believe him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro put down his beer and said solemnly, “When I get back to Honolulu, I’m going to introduce a new motto.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?”</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘What’s good enough for the vanquished, is good enough for the victor.’ I’m going to see to it that a man in Hawaii has a right to join a union, too. Just like a man in Tokyo. And when I start, Hoxworth Hale better stand back. He won last time because labor was stupid. Next time I’ll win because of what I’m learning in Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t commit yourself to trouble,” Shig warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you don’t do the same,” Goro countered, “I’ll be ashamed of you. You’ll have wasted your war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the first time Shig had heard the phrase that was to determine his behavior in the next few years. “Don’t waste your war!” On this first enunciation of the basic law he said to his brother, “I’ve been wondering what I ought to do, Goro. Talking so much with Dr. Abernethy has convinced me of one thing. There isn’t a single Japanese on Hawaii that’s educated. Oh, there are smart men like Pop and medical doctors like Dr. Takanaga, but they don’t really know anything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re so right,” Goro agreed sadly, slumping over his beer. “Have you ever talked to a real smart labor leader from New York?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So I thought maybe I’d go to Harvard Law School.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What a marvelous idea!” Goro cried. “But look, kid, I don’t want you to go there and just learn law.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have no intention of doing that,” Shig replied carefully. “Dr. Abernethy suggested that maybe I’d like to live with him. His wife’s a lawyer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro became positively excited. “And you’d talk at night, and get a little polish and argue about world history. Shig! Take it. Look, I’d even help you with the money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Aren’t you going on to graduate school?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro blushed, toyed with his beer, then looked at his watch. “I think I have other plans,” he confessed. “I want you to meet her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Dai Ichi Hotel in Tokyo stood near the elevated loop that circled the city, and not far from the Shimbashi Station. In 1946 this area was filled each night with pathetic and undernourished Japanese girls, some of the most appealing prostitutes Asia had ever produced, and the tragedy of their near-starvation was that when they began to recover their health, and their cheeks filled out, they were so confirmed in streetwalking that they could not easily convert into any other occupation, and they continued at their old trade, mastering a few English words and sometimes moving into surreptitious army quarters with their G.I. lovers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, as Shig and Goro walked through the bitter cold of a Tokyo January night, the horde of girls called to them in Japanese, “Nice Nisei G.I. Would you like to sleep with a real warm girl tonight?” Shig felt sick and tried not to look at the haunting, starved faces, but they pressed near him, begging, “Please, Nisei, I make you very happy for one night. I am a good girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They looked exactly like the prettier Japanese girls he had known in Hawaii, and as they tugged hungrily at his arms, he thought: “Maybe there’s something about losing a war that Dr. Abernethy doesn’t appreciate. Maybe it isn’t so good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In time the brothers broke away from the Shimbashi girls and turned left toward the Ginza, but they kept away from that broad street which M.P.’s patrolled and headed instead for the Nishi, or west, Ginza, where they entered into an exciting maze of alleys, one of which contained a very tiny bar, not much bigger than a bedroom, called Le Jazz Bleu. Ducking swiftly inside, they found the little room thick with smoke, bar fumes and the sound of an expensive gramophone playing Louis Armstrong. Three customers sat on minute barstools, while from the rear an extremely handsome girl in western clothes approached. She was no more than twenty, tall, thin from undereating, and with an unforgettably alert face. Extending a slim hand to Goro she cried in Japanese, “Welcome to our center of culture and sedition!” And with these words she introduced Shig into one of the most fascinating aspects of postwar Japan: the intellectual revolution.</p>

  <p class="normal">With bad luck Akemi could have become, and she knew it, a Hershey-bar girl, cadging nylons and canned beef from G.I.’s at Shimbashi Station, but in the earliest days of the Occupation she had been lucky enough to meet Goro Sakagawa, and he was not a Hershey-bar boy. It is true that he gave her whatever food and money he could afford, but she gave him little in return except exciting talk, a knowledge of Japan and more spiritual love than he knew existed in the world. It took Shig about two minutes to see that this pair was going to get married.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why does she work in a bar?” he asked Goro when Akemi disappeared to serve some customers.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She wants to work, and she likes the music,” Goro explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is she an Edokko?” Shig inquired, referring to the old name for Tokyo.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The purest modenne,” Goro laughed. Postwar Japanese youth prided themselves on their use of French, and to be modenne-- moderne--was their highest ambition. “This girl is a terrific brain,” Goro confided.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll bet she’s not Hiroshima-ken?” Shig teased.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you seen Hiroshima?” Goro asked. “Pppssskkk!” he hissed, leveling his hand over the floor. “I don’t want anything to do Hiroshima.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mom’s going to be very unhappy,” Shig warned. “You come all the way to Japan and don’t have sense enough to get yourself a Hiroshima girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is the girl for me,” Goro said as Akemi rejoined them, and when she came to a table, his or anyone’s, she added a new dimension to it, for she contained within her slim body an electric vitality which marked many people in the new Japan.</p>

  <p class="normal">At midnight she whispered, “Soon the customers will go, and then we have real fun.” Patiently she waited for the wandering drinkers to empty their glasses, and to each straggler she said a warm good night, thus insuring their subsequent return, but when the last had gone and the proprietor was turning out the lights, she sighed and said, “I wish drinks cost less. Then men would guzzle them faster.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Opening the darkened door a crack she whispered, “No M.P.’s,” and the trio ducked down a series of the smallest alleys in the world, barely wide enough for two to pass if one stood sideways, and finally they came to a darkened door which Akemi-san pushed slowly open, revealing a rather large room in which more than a dozen young men and women sat in the most rigid silence, for an imported gramophone was playing music that neither Shig nor Goro could recognize, but its name was obvious, for on a music stand, with a single shaft of light playing upon it, rested the album from which the records had been taken: Mahler’s Kindertotenlied sung by a German group. Quietly the newcomers sank to the floor, and when the music ended and more lights were lit, they saw that they were among an intense Japanese group composed of handsome young men and pretty girls. When talk began, it was all about Paris and Andre Gide and Dostoevski. Much of it was in French, and since Shig had acquired a smattering of that language, he was well received.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then talk turned to the new Japan: freedom for women, the breaking up of large estates, the new role of labor, and both Shig and Goro were able to contribute much, but just as it seemed as the old Japan were forever dead, Akemi appeared in a frail, tattered kimono which she kept by the gramophone, and the room grew deathly silent, with all assuming old, formal poses as Akemi began the tea ceremony, and as she moved through the curious and ancient ritual of making tea in a set way, and serving it just so, Shig sensed that these young Japanese were no different than he: they were caught in the changing of history, so that with part of their minds they embraced French words and everything modenne, while with the great anchors of the soul they held fast to the most inexplicable secrets of Japan. “Hawaii and Japan face the same problems,” Shig mused, but when frail Akemi nodded that it was his turn, and another girl came creeping toward him on her knees, presenting him with the cup of bitter tea, he took it in both hands as he had been taught, turned the old cup until its most treasured edge was away from his unworthy lips, and drank.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the ceremony ended, talk resumed and the girl who had brought him his bitter tea said, “American M.P.’s can destroy anything but the tea ceremony. No matter how hard you strike at our souls, you always seem to miss.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The statement irritated Shig and he said, “Not being an M.P., I wouldn’t know. For myself, I bring freedom.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What freedom?” the girl asked angrily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Land for the peasants,” Shig said, and for a few minutes he was a hero, but then the lights lowered, the single shaft struck the music stand and Shig read: Bruckner, The First Symphony. This was a London recording, and he liked the music.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night, as they made their way back through the remnant of Shimbashi girls that had caught no men for the evening, but who still hoped, not knowing what might turn up following a late brawl, Shig said, “I’d marry her, Goro. She’s marvelous.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m going to,” his brother replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">And in these strange ways the brothers Sakagawa discovered their ancestral homeland and saw how different it was from what their parents remembered, but they also discovered Hawaii, so that one night Goro slammed down his beer at the Dai Ichi Hotel and fumed: “It’s insane that we should be here, Shig. We ought to be doing the same jobs at home.” And as they worked in Japan, they thought of Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1947 the great Kee hui faced memorable excitements, for Nyuk Tsin was one hundred years old and her family initiated a round of entertainments celebrating that fact, climaxed by a massive fourteen-course dinner at Asia’s brassy restaurant. The little old matriarch, who now weighed ninety-one pounds, appeared at each celebration dressed in black, her sparse gray hair pulled severely back from her temples. She chatted with her huge family and felt proud of their accomplishments, being particularly pleased when Hong Kong’s youngest daughter, Judy, brought a “pianist from the university, where she was studying, to sing a series of songs in Chinese. Nyuk Tsin, watching Judy’s animated face, thought: “She could be a girl from the High Village. I wonder what’s happening there now?”</p>

  <p class="normal">One hundred and forty-one great-great-grandchildren attended the festivities, and upon them Nyuk Tsin poured her special love. Whenever one was presented she would ask the child in Hakka, “And what is your name, my dear?” The child’s mother would poke her offspring and say in English, “Tell Auntie your name.” But if the child replied, “Harry Rodriques,” Nyuk Tsin would correct him and insist upon his real name, and the child would reply, “Kee Doh Kong,” and by decoding this according to the family poem, Nyuk Tsin understood who was standing before her.</p>

  <p class="normal">With her own name she also had trouble, for now there was no one alive in the world who knew what it was. Even her remaining sons, now in their agile seventies and eighties, had never known her name, for she had submerged her own personality in this powerful hui of which she was now the head. She was content to rule as Wu Chow’s Auntie, the concubine without a name, but when she thought of herself it was invariably as Char Nyuk Tsin, the daughter of a brave peasant who had risen to be a general. She was deeply moved, therefore, when the celebrations were ended and her sons Asia and Europe said to her, “Wu Chow’s Auntie, I see no further reason why we should continue to send money to our mother in the Low Village. She must surely be dead by now, and her family has never done anything for us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“On the other hand,” Nyuk Tsin. reasoned, “she may still be alive, just as I am, and if so she would need the money more than ever. After all, she is your mother and you owe her that respect.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Only one misfortune clouded her hundredth birthday: her principal grandson Hong Kong was obviously in trouble, for he was ill at ease, nervous and irritable. Nyuk Tsin guessed that he was having difficulty meeting payments on the various ventures into which she had goaded him, and she was sorry that it was he who had to bear the burden of these trying days and not she. Therefore, when the mammoth dinner at Asia’s ended, the little old lady told the women about her that she wanted to talk with Hong Kong, and after she was taken home and had examined her body for leprosy, and had inspected her big disgraceful feet, she appeared in a black gown with buttons down the right side and asked in Hakka, “Hong Kong, are things so very bad?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Auntie, the detectives are back again,” he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you don’t know whether that means good or bad,” she observed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Detectives are never good,” he assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you know they’re back?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kamejiro Sakagawa said they were digging into his land deal again. They were also asking sly questions at Australia’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How are we fixed for taxes and mortgage payments?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the one bright spot, and he said with some relief, “Not too bad. With the money we saved last year we’re out of trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then we’ll be prudent and wait,” she advised. “If someone wants to hurt you, Hong Kong, keep him off balance. Make him take the first step toward you, for then you can watch him coming and take precautions.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Four days later the first step came, in the person of a husky, quiet-spoken Irishman from Boston with huge, bushy-black eyebrows, who said that his name was McLafferty and who appeared in Hong Kong’s office asking idle questions about real estate, and from the assured manner in which the visitor behaved, Hong Kong deduced: “This one has the detective reports in his pocket. He knows.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Not much happened that first day. Hong Kong probed: “You looking for a hotel site? You got something else in mind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What hotel sites have you?” Mr. McLafferty parried, but it was obvious that he wasn’t interested. “I’ll be back,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">As soon as he was gone, Hong Kong started half a dozen Kees on his trail, but all they turned up was that he really was Mr. McLafferty and he was a lawyer from Boston, stopping at the Lagoon. Hong Kong took this information to his grandmother, and they carefully weighed the various possibilities that might bring a Boston lawyer to Hawaii, and Hong Kong was all for dispatching a cable to a Kee who was studying at Harvard asking for detailed information on McLafferty, but his grandmother told him to wait. “Don’t get excited until he makes some specific move,” she cautioned him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two days later Mr. McLafferty returned and said casually, “If my syndicate decided on one of the big hotel sites … at your price? Could you deliver title to the land?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong realized that considering the intricate Hawaiian system of land ownership, this apparently trivial question was a trap, so he answered slowly and cautiously, “Well, I’d better explain, Mr. McLafferty, that out here we don’t sell land fee simple. What I’d be willing to do is guarantee you a fifty-year lease.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You can’t sell us any land outright?” McLafferty probed cautiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My hui—are you familiar with the word hui?—well my hui has a little fee simple, but not choice hotel sites. What we do have is control of some of the best leases in Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why don’t you people sell fee simple?” McLafferty asked directly, but not bluntly. He was a careful operator.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong decided not to waste time. “Mr. McLafferty, I don’t think you’re paying attention to land problems here. If you’re far enough along to talk seriously about a hotel site you’re bound to know that our estates never sell land. They lease it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mr. McLafferty liked this blunt answer, liked all he knew about Hong Kong, which was considerable, and felt that the propitious moment had come. “Could we send your secretary out? For maybe an hour?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Certainly,” Hong Kong replied, his pulse hammering. He had learned that when this happened he must slow down . . . instantly. So he took some minutes giving his girl exaggerated instructions which Mr. McLafferty recognized as stalling. Then the wiry Chinese banker closed the door carefully, locked it, and returned to his desk, his pulse back to normal. In order to make his visitor think he had been taken in by the hotel talk he said, “Now we have three wonderful hotel sites . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not interested in hotels,” the visitor said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are you interested in?” Hong Kong asked evenly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I represent Gregory”</p>

  <p class="normal">The name literally exploded in the quiet office, ricocheted around Hong Kong’s ears and left him stunned. Finally he asked, “You going to bull your way into the islands?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have used exactly the right word,” McLafferty said coldly. “Six months from now, Mr. Kee, we will have bulled our way into the biggest goddamned store right,” and he whipped out a secret map of downtown Honolulu, “here.” Forcefully he jabbed his finger at a prime intersection.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Hong Kong saw the location he gasped. “The Fort will break you, Mr. McLafferty,” he warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nope. We’re too strong. We’re ready to lose five million dollars the first three years. We have resources of nearly half a billion behind that. The Fort is not going to break us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But it won’t let you buy that land, or lease it either. You simply aren’t going to get in there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re going to buy it for us, Mr. Kee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s not for sale,” Hong Kong protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I mean, you’re going to get the leases. You’ll use an assumed name … a dozen assumed names. After today I won’t see you again, but we’ll arrange some system of keeping in contact. Gregory’s is breaking into Honolulu, and don’t you ever doubt it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If The Fort doesn’t break you, it’ll break whoever buys the land for you. It has great power to retaliate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ve thought about that … a lot, Mr. Kee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why don’t you call me Hong Kong?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And we spent more than a year analyzing your position out here. If you keep in a solvent position, Hong Kong, nobody can hurt you. And if they try, we stand ready to spend a good deal of the five million we know we’ll lose, shoring you up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong liked this daring, cold-blooded Boston Irishman, and after a moment’s reflection asked, “You have to have that specific comer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No other,” the lawyer said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How long do I have?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Six months.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You agree to pay fifty per cent above going rates?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll do better. You give us a strict accounting of actual costs, and we’ll give you a hundred per cent commission.’</p>

  <p class="normal">“You know that if The Fort hears about this . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We know. That’s why we chose you to negotiate the leases.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong leaned back. “You’re certainly aware, Mr. McLafferty, that the profit to me is not very substantial. But nevertheless you’re asking me to risk my business life in a head-on tangle with The Fort. How do you reason?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We say this. O. C. Clemmons wants to come into these islands, but The Fort won’t let them. Won’t sell them land. Won’t provide shipping. Won’t do anything. Same with Shea and Horner, same with California Fruit. The Fort has cold-bloodedly decided that no mainland firm will be allowed in Hawaii. They are determined to sat their own prices, keep competition out, garner all profits to The Fort.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know all that,” Hong Kong said evenly. “Maybe better than you. But why should I fight your battle?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For two simple reasons,” the lawyer said. “You’re right that we can’t begin to pay you for the risks you’ll be taking if The Fort decides to eliminate you, as they may. But remember this, Hong Kong. Here is the real estate you control.” And on this map Mr. McLafferty pointed to almost every parcel Hong Kong then held. It was remarkable that the man knew so much. “Now if Gregory’s comes in, and O. C. Clemmons, and Shea and Homer, the entire economic life of Hawaii gets a boost. Land is scarce. They have got to buy from you, and every inch you have will double and treble in value. Hong Kong’, you’ve got to believe that an expanding economy is good for everyone, a stagnant economy is bad for us all. Your profits will come indirectly. And the irony of it is, if The Fort had let us in ten years ago when we first tried, for every dollar of profit we made, they would have made six, because we would have stirred up their whole economy for them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Fort has no intention of allowing things to be stirred up,” Hong Kong pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And that’s my second reason, Hong Kong. Anything that helps Gregory’s or California Fruit helps you people, and by you people I mean the Japanese and the Chinese. Did your spies find out who my old man was? Look, I know you sent cables to Boston to check on me. Well, my old man was Black Jim McLafferty, a bull-necked Irishman from downtown Boston with ferocious eyebrows like mine, and every fight you Chinese have had in Hawaii, we Irishmen had twice as bad in Boston. But my old man . . . Hong Kong, he was a terror. Wound up governor till the local Fort put him in jail. Then he became mayor on a vindication ticket. I’m Black Jim’s son, and I don’t scare easy. Believe me when I tell you that you’ve got to do to The Fort what my old man did to the stiff-necked Protestants in Boston.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong did not like the way the conversation was going, so he took it onto a higher level by observing, “Seems to me what you have to do sooner or later is get a bigger piece of land on the edge of the city where you can have lots of parking.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We plan to, after we get our first operation working.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you ought to do, if you’re smart, is buy the second piece of land right now before prices go up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Exactly what I wanted to discuss next. We’ve already settled on the location,, and we expect you to buy it for us at the same time you get the downtown leases.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?” Hong Kong asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“At the other end of town there’s a fine piece of land inside a big fence. It’s called the Swamp . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Hong Kong laughed. “Can’t be touched.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’d give two million for it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’d give two million … I’d give two million . . . anybody would, but it can’t be sold.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s owned by an elderly Hawaiian lady called . . .” He took out a piece of paper. “Malama Kanakoa, and she has one boy they call Kelly. He’s a beachboy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. McLafferty, you have remarkable judgment where land is concerned, but this parcel is tied up in a trust. To get it you’ve got to buck three trustees, appointed by the court. You know who they are in this case? First comes Hewlett Janders, from The Fort. Second, John Whipple Hoxworth, from The Fort. And third, Harry Helmore, married to Abigail Hewlett, from The Fort. You think they’re going to let you pick up that land?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll take it to court!” McLafferty stormed, and Hong Kong was pleased to see that the Irishman was in this fight to the finish.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good idea!” the Chinese agreed warmly. “And who do you suppose the judges will be who hear your appeal? Same ones who appointed the trustees. And what are the names of these judges? There’s Judge Clements, married to a Whipple. There’s Judge Harper, from Texas, came out a widower and married a Hoxworth. And there’s Judge McClendin from Tennessee. He’s not married to anybody, but his son is, to a Hale. How do you think they will hand down their decision in a case affecting The Fort?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are they all crooks?” McLafferty asked bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not a one of them,” Hong Kong replied. “In fifty years of pretty close watching The Fort I’ve never caught them in one crooked deal. They’re very honest men, upright, trustworthy. They just happen to believe with all their hearts that only they know what is best for Hawaii. No judge ever hands down a dishonest decision. Never. They just study who’s involved in the case, and if it’s Hong Kong Kee versus Hoxworth Hale, why, on the face of it I’ve got to be wrong, because Hale is a man known to be honest, and whatever he wants to do is unquestionably for the welfare of Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They got it real sewed up, don’t they?” McLafferty growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the best they’ve got is this trustee racket,” Hong Kong continued. “You take this Malama Kanakoa. She has parcels of land worth ten. million … at least. The judges say, ‘Malama, you’re a dear Hawaiian woman with no sense at all. We’re going to put you on a spendthrift trust. Three fine haoles will look after your interests, protect you. All we’re going to charge you for this service is fifty thousand dollars a year. You can have what’s left.’ And then the trustees, appointed by the courts, reason: ‘Best way to keep a Hawaiian in line is keep ‘em in debt.’ So within a year poor Malama is so deep in debt to stores run by The Fort, and she owes the government so many back taxes she never can get her head above water. But year after year the trustees get their fees, before the stores, before the government, before Malama. They filter down a little money to her, and things go on and on.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So by the trick of doing nothing and waiting, they steal the islands blind . . . but in an honest way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong studied this summary for some time, then cautiously observed: “I suppose so far The Fort has held us back two full generations. If we had paid labor a good wage twenty years ago, I suppose our gross island product would have increased maybe half a billion dollars each year.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You don’t call that stealing?” McLafferty asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Technically you can’t, if their intentions are honest. They may be dumb but they’re not crooks.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you’ll get the land for us?” McLafferty asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have to consult my hui,” Hong Kong countered, taking refuge in that word, for he knew that McLafferty would not understand if he said, “I must talk this over with my hundred-year-old grandmother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I needn’t warn you,” the Bostonian said, “that if any of your hui breathes a word of this . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My hui has been keeping secrets for almost a century,” Hong Kong replied cryptically, and next day he reported: “My hui says that now’s the time to strike. I have four Japanese, two Chinese and a Filipino starting to get your land. In six months you’ll have it. How do I slip messages to you in Boston?”</p>

  <p class="normal">McLafferty looked astonished. “Boston?” he repeated. “Didn’t I tell you? I’m living here from now on. I’m part of the revolution that’s about to hit these islands. Since I got my old man’s eyebrows, I suppose that in the elections I’ll be called Black Jim McLafferty. You see, I’m a working Democrat.”</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN</span> Hoxworth Hale, back in 1946, succeeded in frustrating the attempt of California Fruit to open a string of supermarkets in Hawaii, he reported to The Fort: “Within the past year we have been faced by formidable challenges from the mainland. This was to have been expected after the dislocations of war, and for a while it looked as if the dangerous radical movements we have detected in the population might lead to California Fruit’s success, for these outsiders came very close to snapping up several leases, and at one point I was afraid they might succeed in buying out Kamejiro Sakagawa, but we applied certain pressures on the little Japanese and forestalled that. So for the time being, at least, we have turned back a very dangerous enemy. But in a larger sense it seems to me that our real danger is going to come from Gregory’s. They have tried twice now to penetrate our market, and only by the most resolute action have we forestalled them. We must remain extremely alert to keep them out of Hawaii, and I shall consider any member of our group derelict to his duty who does not keep us informed of Gregory’s next move.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As for O. C. Clemmons and Shea and Horner, I feel certain we have scared them off, so that unless something unforeseen happens, we need expect no more challenges from them.” Hoxworth looked steadily at his colleagues, as if to instill into each the courage to keep Hawaii free of alien influences, and the members left that meeting with added resolution, but in 1947 Hale had to summon his confreres again, and this time he reported: “Something is happening around here that I neither like nor understand. I was alerted some time ago by the clerk at the Lagoon to the fact that a Boston lawyer named James McLafferty was in our city and acting rather suspiciously. For example, he was caught talking a long time with the beachboy Kelly Kanakoa—that’s Malama’s rather worthless son. We put some people on Kelly and found out that this McLafferty had brought up the subject,” and here Hoxworth paused for dramatic effect, “the subject of the Swamp.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A white-capped wave of excitement, marked by widely opened eyes, sped about the room, like a breaker heading for shore, and Hale continued: “So far as we can deduce from what Kelly was able to tell us, McLafferty had in mind the possibility of,” again he dropped his voice to underline the enormity of what was going on, “a hotel.” Once more the wave of opened eyes flashed about the room, for the owners of almost every important hotel sat that day in The Fort. “I’ve put tracers on this McLafferty and haven’t come up with much. Hewlett, will you read us what we’ve found so far?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hewlett Janders coughed, picked up a sheet of paper, and read: “James McLafferty, B.A. Holy Cross 1921, Harvard Law School 1926. Practices law in Boston. Served as colonel in the Army Air Corps 1941-45 in charge of land procurement for airstrips in Africa, Italy and England. Author with Professor Harold Abernethy of Harvard Land Procurement Policies of the U. S. Army Air Corps. Son of the infamous Black Jim McLafferty, long-time Democratic politician who served a term in jail for malfeasance while governor. Roman Catholic and visited Rome twice while on duty overseas, which endeared him to his father’s constituents. He himself has never run for office.” Big Hewlett Janders stopped, then added, “No clue as to who is employing him for whatever he’s doing in Hawaii.” Hewlett threw the paper on the table as if to say, “If you think you can make anything out of this, you’re welcome to try.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth Hale said, “Well, what does it add up to? We find that a stranger who knows a lot about land procurement, who is obviously a radical of some sort from Harvard, is interested in the Swamp . . . for a hotel. It certainly looks to me as if he were the kind of man we’ve been trying to keep out of our city.” The men about the table nodded, so Hale continued: “Do we have any of the Kanakoa Trust men among us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hewlett Janders replied, “I’m on the board, so is John Whipple Hoxworth. The third member is Harry Helmore and he can certainly be trusted.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you speak for Harry?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, he’s married to my cousin Abigail,” Hewlett pointed out. “I guess I can speak for him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is it agreed then that under no circumstances will Malama Kanakoa be allowed to sell the Swamp to McLafferty?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So far as I’m concerned,” Hewlett replied. “How about you, John Hoxworth?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It would be criminal to admit a man like that into our city.” “Then it’s agreed,” Hoxworth announced, but his natural caution in these matters was not yet satisfied, so he asked, “Let’s suppose for a minute that this talk about a hotel was a blind. Let’s suppose that McLafferty was acting as front man for someone entirely different. Gentlemen, I think that’s a fair supposition. Whom does this man really represent?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The wily, practiced men of The Fort turned their whole attention to this problem. Slowly John Whipple Hoxworth, a thin, clever man with a typical Whipple intellect, reasoned: “The group that was most furious when we turned them back was California Fruit, but I think that out of natural vanity they would refuse to recruit an agent from Boston. It just wouldn’t seem palatable to a Californian. I don’t think O. C. Clemmons is going to fight again, and after two bad whippings I doubt that Gregory’s will be back. Therefore I have to conclude that it’s Shea and Horner. It’s the kind of trick they’d pull, and after all, remember that Shea is a prominent Catholic.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wonder if it could be Gregory’s after all?” Hoxworth mused. “Has anybody met this McLafferty yet?”</p>

  <p class="normal">No one had, and the meeting ended with Hale’s final warning: “I suppose you’ve all read that California Fruit has signed a contract with their labor unions? Gregory’s entered into one three years ago, and you know the Shea and Horner stand. If you require any encouragement in this fight to keep men like McLafferty out of our city, keep the labor union angle in mind.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the others had left The Fort, Hoxworth Hale sat brooding upon the things they had been discussing, and he could not comprehend how any sensible man who loved Hawaii would even consider allowing an outfit like Gregory’s entrance to the islands. “Why, damn it all!” he growled. “They’re outsiders. They undercut established principles, and if they made a little money, what would they do with it? Siphon it off to New York. Does it ever do Hawaii any good? Not a penny of it.” He looked out his window toward the Missionary Public Library, built with family funds, then toward the Missionary Art Museum, which his Grandfather Ezra had endowed with half a million dollars and a Rembrandt. In the distance lay the Missionary Natural History Museum, housing an unmatched collection of Hawaiian artifacts, and beyond it stood the rugged, magnificent memorial to old Abraham Hewlett’s love of the Hawaiian people, Hewlett Hall, where Hawaiian boys and girls were given free a first-rate education. More important were the things that could not be seen: the family professorships at the university, the Missionary Foundation for Oceanic Research, the Missionary Fund for Retired Ministers. You could scarcely touch an aspect of Hawaii which had not been improved and nourished by some member of The Fort.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Suppose we allowed Gregory’s to come in and operate as they wished,” Hoxworth mused. “Let’s look at Honolulu fifty years from now. Is there going to be a Gregory’s Museum, or a Gregory’s School for Hawaiians? They will steal our money and give us nothing in return except lower prices for a little while. Will their executives raise large families here and put their children to work in the islands? They will not. We will have soulless absentee landlordism of the worse sort. If Gregory’s ever do wedge their way into the islands . . . after my death I hope . . . they will bring us nothing . . . nothing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked back and forth in real perplexity and came at last to the nexus of his thinking: “No, I’m wrong. They’ll bring two things. They’ll bring political unrest, because half of their people will be New Deal Democrats with radical ideas. And they’ll bring labor unions.” These two potentialities were so abhorrent that he paused to look out over the Honolulu he loved so well. “Why don’t the people down there trust us to know what’s best for these islands?” he asked in some bewilderment. “You’d think they’d bear in mind all we’ve done for Hawaii. Why, they ought to rise up as one man and kick outfits like Gregory’s or California Fruit right into the ocean. But they never seem to appreciate what’s best for them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His secretary interrupted to say, “That young Japanese is trying to see you again,” and Hale shook his head furiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not me! Negotiating with labor is Hewie’s problem,” and he ducked out a back door, calling for Hewlett Janders. When the big man appeared, Hale commissioned him: “See if you can handle this young troublemaker once and for all,” and he felt some assurance as big Hewie hitched up his belt and went forth to battle.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Janders entered the board room he found there a confident, crop-haired, smiling young man who extended his right hand across the table and said, “I’m Goro Sakagawa, sir. I remember how good you were to my brothers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The gesture caught big Hewie Janders off guard, and for a fleeting instant he thought: “This is the brother we didn’t take into Punahou. If we had, he’d never have grown up to be a labor leader.” Then he dismissed the thought and said sternly, “What is it you wish to see me about, young man?” Pointedly, he did not ask Goro to sit down.</p>

  <p class="normal">Displaying some of the polish he had acquired while serving with General MacArthur in Japan, Goro ignored the fact that he had to remain standing and said, “They tell me your son Harry was killed on Bougainville.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He was,” Janders replied, and that made it necessary for him to ask, “Wasn’t one of your brothers killed in Italy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two,” Goro replied, and somehow each of the negotiators realized that Hewlett Janders of The Fort had been subtly brought down to Goro Sakagawa’s level. They were equal, and Goro said, “You asked why I wanted to see you. I’ve been nominated by the men at Malama Sugar . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I won’t discuss a labor union.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I haven’t said anything about a labor union,” Goro pointed out, shifting from one foot to the other while Hewlett slumped back in his chair.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What else would you want to talk about?” Janders snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right, since you bring the matter up, Mr. Janders. Malama Sugar is going to organize . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Get out!” Janders said abruptly, his voice rising even though he remained seated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Quietly Goro replied, “Malama Sugar is going to be organized, Mr. Janders. Under federal law we are entitled . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Out!” Janders shouted. Leaping to the door he called for his assistants, and when they had piled into the room he commanded: “Throw this communist out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro, even stockier than he had been in high school, braced himself against the table and spoke quickly: “Mr. Janders, I’m not a communist and I’m not going to let your people throw me out, because if they did I’d have a court case against you. Then your position on the union would harden, and we’d have even more trouble discussing things intelligently. So call the dogs off.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will never accept a union,” Janders cried. “And don’t you ever come stomping back into this office.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Janders, I promise you that the first plantation we organize will be Malama Sugar, and when we reach the final negotiations I will sit in this chair . . .” Goro reached for a chair, lifted it carefully and set it down in (position. “This chair. Save it for me, Mr. Janders. The next time we meet here will be to sign papers. The name’s Goro Sakagawa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He left the room quietly and Janders dismissed his aides. Slumping into his chair he tried to understand what had happened: “A Japanese field hand stomped into my office and told me . . .” He collapsed in incredulity and called for Hoxworth Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How’d it go?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A Japanese field hand stomped into my office and told me . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Quit the dramatics, Hewie. What happened?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re going to organize Malama Sugar.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’ll never make it,” Hale said firmly. He summoned The Fort and told his men, “Hewie’s had a bad ten minutes. Young Sakagawa tipped his hand . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He stomped in here and tried to tell me . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hewie!” Hale interrupted. “He didn’t try to tell you. Damn it all, he told you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re going to organize Malama Sugar,” Janders repeated. “And if they succeed there . . . then they’ll try the rest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This has come sooner than I expected,” Hale observed. “When we beat back our Russian communists in the strikes of 1939 and 1946, I figured we had them licked. But apparently the dreadful Roosevelt virus has infected our entire society.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I never expected to see the day,” Janders mumbled, “when a Japanese field hand could stomp into my office . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hard, competent Hoxworth Hale, who from behind the scenes had masterminded the two preceding fights against the union, now began marshaling his forces. ‘Rapping on the table he said, “We shall present a unified force against them, and if anyone of you in this room wavers, we will show no mercy. On the one hand, the Japanese radicals will overwhelm you. And on the other, we’ll ruin you. No credit. No common merchandising. No legal support. Gentlemen, you stick with us or you perish.” He stopped, glared at the men, and asked, “Is that agreed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Agreed,” the plantation men muttered, and the strike was on.</p>

  <p class="normal">When policies had been set and the meeting adjourned, the plantation owners stood nervously about the room, unwilling to leave, and Hale asked, “How did a decent young man like Goro Sakagawa, with three brothers in Punahou, ‘become a communist?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders replied, “I think he was assigned to the A.F. of L. in Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A pall settled over The Fort. John Whipple Hoxworth mused: “To think that our government took a decent Japanese boy and instructed him in labor tactics!” Something of the world’s maniacal contradiction seeped into the room and mocked the managers, and Hoxworth Hale asked sadly, “You mean that a boy who might have gone to Punahou was perverted by our own government?” On this gloomy note the first meeting of The Fort’s strike committee ended.</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, when Hewlett Janders accused Goro Sakagawa of being a communist he was not far from the truth. When The Fort, in 1916, 1923, 1928, 1936, 1939 and 1946, refused point-blank even to discuss unionism and used every known device including force and subversion to block labor from attaining any of its legitimate ends, it made .normal unionization of the islands impossible. The hardhitting but completely American union organizers sent out from the mainland found that in Hawaii customary procedures got nowhere. Not even the vocabulary of unionism was understood, or acknowledged where it was understood, so that both The Fort and the Honolulu Mail invariably referred to any union activity as communism; as a result, over the course of years Hawaii developed its own rather strange definition for terms which on the mainland were understood and accepted as logical parts of modern industrial life. In brief, unionism was subversion.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were also physical difficulties. Oftentimes mainland men whom the course of history proved to have been rather moderate labor organizers were refused entrance to the islands. If they tried to talk to plantation hands they were bodily thrown off the premises. If they tried to hire a headquarters hall, none was allowed them. They were intimidated, vilified, abused and harassed by charges of communism.</p>

  <p class="normal">In obedience to Gresham’s Law of social change, when the moderates were driven out, the radicals moved in, and from 1944 on, a group of ultra-tough labor men quietly penetrated the islands and among them were many communists, for they had seen from afar that the situation in Hawaii made it a likely spot for the flowering of the communist creed. Among the leaders was a hefty, ugly Irish Catholic from New York named Rod Burke, who had joined the Party in 1927 and who had steadily risen in its ranks until he had reached a position of eminence from which he could be trusted to lead a serious attack upon Hawaii. His first step was to marry a Baltimore Nisei, and this Japanese girl, already a communist, was to prove of great assistance to him in his grand design for capturing the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">For example, when Rod Burke met Goro Sakagawa, returning to Hawaii after his instructive labor experiences in Japan, Burke instantly spotted the capable young army captain as the kind of person he required for the unionization and subsequently the communization of Hawaii. So Burke said to his Japanese wife, “Get young Sakagawa lined up,” and the dedicated Nisei girl succeeded in enlisting Goro not as a communist but as a labor organizer, and through him Burke conscripted other Japanese and Filipinos without confiding to them his membership in the Communist Party. In this way a solid-core labor movement was founded which in 1947 stood ready to confront The Fort and fight to the rugged, island-breaking end. In later years Goro Sakagawa often discussed these beginnings with his lawyer brother Shigeo, back from an honors degree at Harvard, and he allowed Shig to probe his motives and understandings as they existed in early 1947. “Did you know then that Rod Burke was a communist?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, I never knew for sure, but I guessed he was,” Goro explained. “He never gave me any proof. But I recognized him as a tough-minded operator.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you had these suspicions, Goro, why were you willing to hook up with him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I realized from experience that old-style methods would never break The Fort. We tried reasonable unionism and got nowhere. Burke knew how to apply power. That’s the only thing The Fort understood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did Burke ever try to sign you up in the Party?” “No, he figured he could use me and then dump me in favor of the dumber Japanese and Filipinos he did sign up in the Party,” Goro explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How did he select his men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, he picked them up where he could. Started enlisting Japanese who didn’t know too much . . . Filipinos too. But they were just for support. The real guts of the Party was Rod Burke and his wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where did that leave you?” Shig explored. “I figured just like Burke,” Goro explained. “I figured I was smart enough to use him and then dump him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Must have been a very interesting period,” Shig said wryly. “There were no illusions on either side,” Goro confessed. “Funny thing is that my wife, Akemi, figured the Burkes out the first time she saw them. She’d come up against a lot of communists in Japan, and she spotted Mrs. Burke instantly. And I think Mrs. Burke spotted her, so nobody was fooled,” Goro assured his brother.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did Burke sign up any really good men?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, most of the Japanese were dopes, pure and simple, but Hany Azechi was as able a man as we ever produced in the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Looking back on it, Goro, do you think the alliance was necessary?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro had often thought about this, especially since he had known so intimately the moderate A.F. of L. men on General MacArthur’s team, and he concluded: “If you remember the position taken by The Fort . . . that even a discussion of labor was communism . . . Hell, Shig, I’ve told you about the time I went in to see Hewlett Janders. He made me stand like a peasant with my cap in my hands. Abused me, ridiculed me. Shig, there was no alternative.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“None?” his brother asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“None. Hawaii could never have moved into the twentieth century until the power of The Fort was broken. I alone couldn’t have done it. The A.F. of L. men I knew in Japan couldn’t have done it. Only a gutter fighter like Rod Burke could have accomplished it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So when Hewlett Janders announced to the Honolulu Mail that mainland communists were endeavoring to capture the islands, he was right. And when he charged that Japanese had joined the Party under Rod Burke’s leadership, he was also correct. But when he said that the leader of the plantation part of the strike, Goro Sakagawa, was also a communist, he was not right, but in those tense years the hatred of labor was so great that a relatively minor error like that didn’t really matter.</p>

  <p class="normal">The strike was a brutal, senseless, tearing affair, and it frightened Hawaii as nothing previous had ever done, not even the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Rod Burke moved swiftly to tie up the waterfront so that not a single H &amp; H ship entered Hawaii for five and one half starving, agonized months. The Fort retaliated by cutting credit, so that everyone in the islands felt the pinch.</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro Sakagawa led his sugar-plantation workers out on strike. The Fort retaliated by suspending all sorts of benefits, so that soon it was not the workers who felt the cruelty of social warfare, but their families.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rod Burke allowed no cargoes of either sugar or pineapple to leave the islands and no tourists to come in. The Fort retaliated by closing two of its hotels, and the maids and waiters thus thrown out of work were less able to weather the strike than were the hotel owners.</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro Sakagawa got the pineapple workers to join the strike. The Fort coldly announced that its food-supply warehouses were nearly empty and it could no longer distribute to stores like Kamejiro Sakagawa’s, so one shopkeeper after another faced bankruptcy.</p>

  <p class="normal">No man can understand Hawaii who does not understand the great strike. It crippled the islands to the point of despair. Newsprint ran low and the existence of the papers was threatened. Food diminished to the one-week mark, and many families went hungry. Sugar plantations saw their crops rotting in the parching sunlight. Pineapple fields went untended, and millions upon millions of unrecoverable dollars were lost. Banks watched their normal flow of business halted. Big stores had neither new stocks nor old customers. Doctors went unpaid and dentists saw no patients. The major hotels could serve only inadequate foods, and the very life of the islands ground slowly to a halt.</p>

  <p class="normal">For a strike in Hawaii was not like a strike in Florida. It was like nothing the mainland ever knew, for in Florida if the waterfront was tied up, food could be imported by train, and if the trains were closed down, men could use trucks, and if they were struck, hungry families could organize car caravans, and if they failed, a desperate man could walk. But in Hawaii when the docks were tied up, there were no alternatives, and the islands came close to prostration. Reasonable industrial relations having proved impractical, stupidity on the part of both capital and labor nearly destroyed the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the beginning of the sixth month Goro Sakagawa, attended by four assistants, marched into the board room of The Fort, waited for the directors of the great plantations to assemble, and then sat in precisely the chair he had promised Hewlett Janders he would one day occupy, and in that symbolic moment some of the intractable fight went out of him. It was curious that seating oneself in a chair that had been insolently forbidden should affect a man, as if there were hidden emotional channels that ran from his bottom to his brain, but that is what happened. Secure in his chair, Goro said in conciliatory manner, “We think the strike has progressed long enough. We are sure you think the same. Is there not some way to end it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will not have a Japanese field hand stomp into my office . . .” Hewlett Janders began, but Hoxworth Hale looked at him in pity, as if the horrors of six months had been useless, in that Janders was using the same words he had used when the strike began.</p>

  <p class="normal">Quietly Goro ignored him and addressed Hale, a tough negotiator: “Mr. Hale, my committee is not going to take cognizance of the fact that your negotiator, Mr. Hewlett Janders, has attacked us for being Japanese, because we know that your cousin, Colonel Mark Whipple, laid down his life that we might be free citizens. We’re acting as free citizens, and I think you appreciate that fact.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The gracious tribute to Colonel Whipple softened the meeting, and all remembered what this same Goro Sakagawa, an army captain in those days, had said when it was proposed to bring Mark Whipple’s body home from the Vosges Mountains: “Let them bring my brothers home, but Colonel Whipple should sleep in the heart-land of the world, where he died. No island is big enough to hold his spirit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What new terms have you in mind, Mr. Sakagawa?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will never end the strike unless we get full union recognition,” Goro replied, and Hewlett Janders slumped in his chair. He could see it coming: the others were willing to surrender. The communists were about to triumph. But before Hewie could speak, Goro quickly added, “Then, to match your concession, well accept ten cents an hour less.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Gentlemen,” Hoxworth Hale said with fresh hope, “I think Mr. Sakagawa’s proposal gives us something to talk about.” Subtly the spirit of Colonel Mark Whipple, who had died for these Japanese boys, invaded the room, and Hale asked quietly, “Goro, will you bring your men back in about three hours?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will, Mr. Hale,” the union leader assured him, but as the group started to leave, Hewie Janders asked sharply, “How do we know that communist Rod Burke’ll allow us to open the piers?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what we’ve been negotiating about, Mr. Janders,” Goro replied. “When I reach an agreement with you men, the piers are open. That’s what negotiation means.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the delegation left—three Japanese, a haole and two Filipinos—Hewlett Janders left his seat at the head of the table and said, “I cannot participate in what you men are about to do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I appreciate your position,” Hale said coldly. “But will you bind yourself to accept what we decide?” At this question everyone turned to stare at Janders. If he refused to accept, in the name of J &amp; W, the principal plantation operators, no one knew what the eventuality might be, and it was just possible that he might be big enough to resist both the unions and his own associates. Desperately he was tempted to fight this out to a Gottedammerung conclusion, but he was prevented from doing so by cautious words from the man who twenty years before had taken the leadership of The Fort from him. Hoxworth Hale said slowly, “Hewie, your family and mine have always loved these islands. We cannot stand by and see them suffer any further.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The big man looked in dismay at his leader and was about to reject the proposals, but Hale reasoned: “If we must live with labor, and that seems to be the spirit of the times, let’s do so with a certain grace. I’m going to call Sakagawa back and make the best…”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do not wish to be present,” Janders said abruptly. He started to leave the room by the back door, but paused to warn his associates: “You’re turning these islands over to the communists. I refuse to watch a Japanese field hand come stomping into my, office to lay down . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you will consider yourself bound by our decision?” Hale interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Janders snapped grudgingly, and when Goro returned to ratify the mutual surrender, Hewlett Janders was not there.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the great strike ended, three of Hale’s plantation managers, men senior to himself, quit with these words: “We been doin’ things our own way too long to be told by a bunch of slant-eyed Japs how to raise sugar.” Younger men stepped forward to take their places—and it was a rueful moment when Hale discovered that he did not even know two of the replacements—and before the year ended, the new overseers were reporting: “We can work with the new system. Looks like we’ll make more sugar than before.” Hewie Janders snorted: “Something is eroding the character of America when young men are so eager to compromise with evil.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then Hewie made his point. At a meeting of The Fort he rushed in with the news that one of the lesser communists had broken with Rod Burke and had signified his willingness to identify both Burke and his wife as card-carrying members of the Communist Party. This caused a flurry of excitement, which a series of substantiating phone calls raised to fever pitch. “I knew the whole lot of them were communists!” Hewie cried triumphantly. “To think that we allowed Goro Sakagawa to come stomping into this office . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t believe he’s charged,” Hale cautioned. “At least when I called Jasper he didn’t . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re all communists,” Hewie warned. “I told you a year ago that Rod Burke was a red. And he was. I tell you now that Goro Sakagawa is a red. And he is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">John Whipple Hoxworth said icily, “Let’s wait till they’re indicted, then apply all our strength until they’re convicted.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Has anybody called the governor?” Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not yet,” John Whipple replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d love to!” Janders gloated. “Last time I saw him about communism he said . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nobody will call anybody,” Hale interrupted. “A great thing has happened in our favor. Nobody must spoil it.” And The Fort studied carefully how the new developments could be used to its advantage.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the day’s triumph was somewhat dampened by an assistant’s report that while everyone’s attention had been focused on the strike, something curious seemed to have been happening, something which he was unable to explain. Producing a map of downtown Honolulu, he pointed to certain areas hatched in red and explained: “This is the Rafer Hoxworth building, and the ground floor has been leased to a Japanese named Fujimoto. Nothing suspicious about that. He has the big dry-goods store in Kaimuki. Now this area is the restaurant whose building is owned by Ed Hewlett’s widow. It’s been leased to a Filipino who runs a restaurant in Wahiawa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are you driving at, Charley?” Hoxworth asked impatiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look!” the assistant cried. “Within the past six months, every store in this block has been leased, except the big Joe Janders holding. Do you see what that means?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Quiet descended over The Fort as the managers studied the map. Finally Hoxworth said, “If somebody has been leasing these sites under an assumed name . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">This ugly suspicion circulated, but it was soon stopped by robust Hewlett Janders, who said gruffly, “Hell, what are you worrying about? I’ve warned Cousin Joe a hundred times never to lease his building without clearing things with me. As long as he holds fast, there’s not going to be any trouble. What could a person do, with just these little . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Call Joe,” Hoxworth said imperatively.</p>

  <p class="normal">An ominous silence surrounded bluff Hewlett as he cried warmly, “Hell-lo, Joe! This is Hewie. Joe, you haven’t leased your big store site, have you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a ghastly silence, and Hewlett Janders, completely shaken, put down the phone. There was no cause to ask him what had happened; the news stood out from his sagging round face. “God damn!” Hoxworth Hale shouted, banging the table. “We’ve been outsmarted. Who did this?” he raged. “Hewlett, who leased that store?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Big Hewlett Janders kept his head down, staring at the table. “I’m ashamed to say. Kamejiro Sakagawa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll break him!” Hoxworth stormed. “We’ll not bring a single cargo of his into Honolulu. That man will starve on . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Icy John Whipple Hoxworth was speaking: “The problem is twofold. Who engineered this damnable thing? And for whom?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was long discussion as to who could have accumulated enough capital and wisdom to have effected such a coup, and by a slow process of elimination all came to agree that only Hong Kong Kee could have swung it. “Ill challenge him right now,” Hoxworth cried, and in a forthright manner he phoned Hong Kong and asked, “Did you buy up all the leases?” When the Chinese banker replied, Hoxworth nodded his head to his associates. “Whom were you representing, Hong Kong?” This time Hoxworth did not move his head, but listened in stunned silence. “Thank you, Hong Kong,” he said, and put down the phone.</p>

  <p class="normal">“California Fruit?” Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Gregory’s,” Hale replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an aching, dumb silence as an era came to an end. Finally one of the Hoxworths asked, “Can’t we fight this in the courts?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think so,” Hale answered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Surely we could get Judge Harper to issue an injunction on one of these leases. He’s married to my cousin and I could explain…”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If Hong Kong Kee arranged those leases . . .” Hale could not go on. He dropped his head into his hands, thought for a long time and then asked his associates, “How could these people do this to us? Your family, Whipple, why they looked after the Kees. Damn it, the whole Kee hui got its start with that land Old Doc gave them. And those damned Sakagawas. Imagine Kamejiro showing such ingratitude! Buying leases behind our backs. How do you explain it? You’d think they’d feel some kind of loyalty to us. We brought them here, gave them land, looked after them when they were so damned poor they couldn’t read or write. What’s happening in the world when such people turn against you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what McLafferty’s been doing!” Janders shouted. “He threw us off the track, talking about that hotel.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale now had control of himself and said, “Gentlemen, this is the beginning of an endless fight. I personally am going to obstruct Gregory’s and McLafferty at every turn. Not to keep them out of the islands, because if Hong Kong arranged these leases, they’ll stand up in court . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the Hoxworths interrupted: “You’d think that in view of all we’ve done for Judge Harper, we could at least rely on him to void one of the leases.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale ignored this stupid and unworthy observation, continuing: “We must fight for time. We’ll establish branches of our own stores in Waikiki, in Waialua and across the Pali. Every one of you who controls a going concern, move a branch out into the suburbs. Multiply and tie everything up. By the time Gregory’s get here, we’ll have our stores so prosperous they’ll die on the vine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So, in the curious way by which a deadly catfish, when thrown into a pool of trout, eats a few of the lazy fish but inspires the others to greater exertion, so that in the end there are more trout, and better, and all because of the evil catfish, the arrival of Gregory’s into Hawaii, followed by California Fruit and Shea and Horner, drove the Hawaiian economy ahead by such spurts that soon The Fort was much better off than it had been before. In the same obtuse way, the increased wages that Goro Sakagawa’s union had chiseled out of The Fort really made that establishment richer than ever, because much of the money filtered back into its enterprises, and the general prosperity of the islands multiplied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale’s determination to fight the mainland intruders with increased economic energy of his own had one unforeseen effect upon Hawaii, and in subsequent years this was often cited as the real revolution of that trying age: if The Fort was going to compete on an equal footing with outfits like Gregory’s, it could no longer afford to promote into top positions inadequate nephews and cousins and gutless second sons. So under Hoxworth Hale’s sharp eye, a good many Hales and Hoxworths and Janderses and Hewletts were weeded out. His policy was forthright: Either give them minor jobs where they can’t wreck the system, or give them substantial shares of stock on which they can live while real men run the companies.” As a result, what crude Hewlett Janders called “the chinless wonders” found themselves with a lot of stock, a good yearly income and freedom to live either in France or Havana; while in their places appeared a flood of smart young graduates of the Wharton School, Stanford and Harvard Business. Some, out of sheer prudence, married Whipple girls or Hales or Hewletts, but most brought their own wives in from the mainland. And all Hawaii prospered.</p>

  <p class="normal">But of the men who dominated The Fort, only shrewd, confused Hoxworth Hale, alternately fighting and surrendering, saw what the real menace of those days was. It was not the arrival of Gregory’s, nauseating though that was, nor the triumph of the unions, seditious as that was: it lay in the fact that Black Jim McLafferty was a Democrat. His legal residence was now Hawaii. He no longer worked for Gregory’s but had a small law practice of his own, which he combined with politicking, and whenever Hoxworth Hale passed McLafferty’s office he studied the door with foreboding, for he knew that in the long run Democrats were worse than Gregory’s or unions or communists.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was therefore appalled one morning when he saw that McLafferty’s door carried a new sign: McLafferty and Sakagawa. Shigeo was back from Harvard, an expert on land reform, a brilliant legalist, and thanks to Black Jim McLafferty’s foresight, an official Democrat.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>FOLLOWING THE STRIKE</span>, two of the main protagonists were taken out of circulation by family problems, and for some time not much was heard of either Goro Sakagawa or Hoxworth Hale. At first it looked as if the former’s troubles were the greater, for from that day in late 1945 when Goro had first met the slim and intense young Tokyo modenne, Akemi-san, their lives had been continuously complicated. First had come harassment by M.P.’s who had tried to enforce the no-fraternization edict of the occupation, and it had been unpleasant to be dating a girl you loved when, the M.P.’s had the right to intrude at any moment. Next had been the ridiculous difficulty faced by any American soldier who wanted to marry a Japanese girl, so that once Goro had remarked bitterly, “When good things are being passed out they never consider me an American, but when they’re dishing out the misery I’m one of the finest Americans on record.” The young lovers had evaded the anti-marriage edict by engineering a Shinto wedding at a shrine near the edge of Tokyo, and had later discovered that Goro couldn’t bring a Shinto bride back to America, so there had been renewed humiliation at the consul’s office, but in those trying periods Akemi-san had proved herself a stalwart girl with a saving sense of humor, and largely because she was so sweet to officialdom, her paper work was ultimately completed and by special connivance she found herself free to enter Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1946, when the troop transport neared Honolulu, Akemi-san had been one of the most practical-minded brides aboard, suffering from few of the illusions whose shattering would mar the first days in America for many of the other girls. She had not been bedazzled by her young American, Goro Sakagawa. She had recognized that he was what modennes called a peasant type, stubborn, imperfectly educated and boorish; and even in the starving days when he had had access to the mammoth P.X.’s that blossomed across Japan, where his military pay had made him a millionaire compared to the Japanese she had known that he was not a rich man. Furthermore, she had been specifically warned by friends who knew others who had lived in Hawaii that the islands were populated mostly by Hiroshima-ken people, who were clannish to a fault and not altogether contemporary. One lively Tokyo girl had whispered to her: “I’ve been to Hawaii. In the entire area, not one modenne.” Akemi had no illusions about her new home, but even so she was not prepared for what faced her.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the dock she was met by Mr. Sakagawa and his son-in-law Mr. Ishii, with their wives standing stolidly behind the stocky little men, and she thought: “This is the way families used to look in Japan thirty years ago.” However, she took an instant liking to bulldog little Sakagawa-san, with his arms hanging out from knees, and thought, as she looked down at him: “He is like my father.” But then she saw grim-faced Mrs. Sakagawa, iron-willed and conservative, and she shivered, thinking to herself: “She’s the one to fear. She’s the kind we had to fight against in Tokyo.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She was right. Mrs. Sakagawa never eased up. Gentle with her husband, she was a terror to her daughter-in-law. Long ago in Hiroshima, when a son brought home a wife to work the rice fields, it was his mother’s responsibility to see that the girl was soon and ably whipped into the habits of a good farm wife, and Mrs. Sakagawa proposed to perform this task for Goro. In fact, as soon as she saw Akemi at the railing of the ship she realized that Goro had made a sad choice, for she whispered contemptuously to her daughter Reiko, “She looks like a city girl, and you know what expensive habits they have.”</p>

  <p class="normal">If Goro had had a well-paying job which permitted him to live away from home, things might have settled down to a mutual and smoldering disapproval in which the two women saw each other as little as possible and were then studiously polite for the sake of Goro, but this could not be, for Goro’s salary at the union did not permit him to have his own home, so he stayed with his parents. Early in her battle to subdue Akemi, Mrs. Sakagawa established her theme: “When I came to Hawaii life was very difficult, and there is no reason why you should be pampered.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does she expect me to go out and chop a few fields of sugar each afternoon?” Akemi asked Goro one night, and in time he began to hate coming home, for each of his women would in turn try to grab him off to some corner to explain the faults of the other and the turmoil of that day.</p>

  <p class="normal">What angered Akemi most was a little thing, yet so recurrent that it began eroding her happiness with Goro. The Sakagawas had not spoken the best Japanese even while growing up in Hiroshima, and their long imprisonment in Hawaii had positively corrupted their speech, so that they now used many Hawaiian, Chinese, haole and Filipino words, with a lilting melody to the speech borrowed from the Mexican. Much of their phraseology was incomprehensible to Akemi, but she said nothing and would have been, polite enough never to have commented on this to the Sakagawas, for as she told another war bride whom she met at the store, “I find their horrible speech rather amusing,” and the two girls had laughed pleasantly together.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Sakagawas were not so considerate. They found Akemi’s precise Japanese, with its careful inflections and pronunciations, infuriating. “She thinks she’s better than we are,” Mrs. Sakagawa stormed one night at Goro. “Always talking as if her mouth were full of beans which she didn’t want to bite.” Often when the family was gathered for evening meal, Akemi would make some casual observation and Mrs. Sakagawa would repeat one or two words, pronouncing them in the barbarous Hawaiian manner. Then everyone would laugh at Akemi, and she would blush.</p>

  <p class="normal">She fell into the habit of waiting at the market till one or another of the war brides came in, and hungrily, like refugees in an alien land, they would talk with each other in fine Japanese without fear of being ridiculed. “It’s like living in Japan a hundred years ago,” Akemi said angrily one day. Then she broke into tears, and when the other girl handed her a mirror, so that she could make up her face and be presentable, she looked at herself a long time and said, “Fumiko, would you think that I had once been the leader of the modennes? I love Bruckner and Brahms. I was fighting to set the Japanese girl free. Now I’m in a worse prison than any of them, and do you know why it’s worse? Because it’s all so horribly ugly. Ugly houses, ugly speech, ugly thoughts. Fumiko, I haven’t been to a concert or a play in over a year. Nobody I know, except you, has ever even heard of Andre Gide. I think we’ve made a terrible mistake.” Later, when alone at the Sakagawas, she thought: “I live for the few minutes I can talk with a sensible human being, but every time I do, I feel worse than before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One night she said forcefully, “Goro, there’s an orchestra concert tonight, and I think we should go.” Awkwardly they went, but she did not enjoy it because Goro felt ill at ease, and the entire audience, except for a few students, were haoles. “Don’t the Japanese ever go to plays or music?” she asked, but he interpreted this as the beginning edge of the complaint, so he mumbled, “We’re busy working.” “For what?” she snapped, and he said nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Akemi next met Fumiko at the market she asked, “What is it they’re working for? In Japan, a man and woman will work like idiots to get tickets for the theater or to buy a beautiful ceramic. What do they work for here? I’ll tell you what for. So that they can buy a big black automobile, and put the old mama-san in the back, and drive around Honolulu and say, ‘Now I am as good as a haole.’ I’m ashamed whenever I see Japanese doctors and lawyers in their big black automobiles.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am too,” Fumiko confessed. “To think that they surrendered everything Japanese for such a set of values.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Things got a little better when Shigeo returned from Harvard with his honors degree in law, for then Akemi had an intelligent person with whom she could talk, and they had long discussions on politics and art. Akemi was astonished to find that Shig had been to visit the museums in Boston, but he explained: “I’d never have gone on my own account, but I was living with Dr. Abernethy and his wife, and they said that any Sunday on which you didn’t do something to improve your mind was a Sunday wasted, and I had a great time with them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell me about the Boston Symphony,” Akemi pleaded. “In Japan we think it’s one of the best.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point shrewd Mrs. Sakagawa took Shigeo aside and said, “You must not talk any more with Akemi-san. She is your brother’s wife, and not a good girl at all, and she will try to make you fall in love with her, and then we will have a tragedy in the family. I told both you and Goro that you ought to avoid city girls, but neither of you would listen, and now see what’s happened.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What has happened?” Shigeo asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Goro has been trapped by a vain and silly girl,” his mother explained. “Music, books, plays all day long. She wants to talk about politics. She is no good, that one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The reasons his mother gave did not impress Shigeo, but the fact that Akemi was temptingly beautiful in her soft Japanese way did, and he stopped being alone with her, so that her life became even more desperate than before. It was rescued by the arrival one day of a young sociologist from the University of Hawaii, a Dr. Sumi Yamazaki, whose parents were also from Hiroshima. Dr. Yamazaki was a brilliant girl who was conducting three hundred interviews with Japanese girls married to G.I.’s, and she got to Akemi late in her study, when her findings had begun to crystallize.</p>

  <p class="normal">Akemi, hoping that her intended visitor might be a woman of sophisticated intelligence, had first dressed in her most modenne Tokyo style, so that she looked almost as if she had come from Paris; but when she saw herself in the mirror she said, “Today I want to be very Japanese,” and she had changed into a languorous pale blue and white shantung kimono with silver zori, and when she met Dr. Yamazaki, she found that it was the attractive young sociologist who was dressed like a real modenne, with bright eyes and quick intelligence to match. The two women liked each other immediately, and Dr. Yamazaki made a brief mental note that she would transcribe later: “Akemi Sakagawa appeared in formal kimono, therefore probably very homesick.” And after two exploratory questions the sociologist was able to categorize her hostess with precision.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your kimono has told me all about you, Mrs. Sakagawa,” she joked, in excellent Japanese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Call me Akemi, please.”</p>

  <a id="section_1"></a>

  <p class="normal">“These are your complaints,” the clever young sociologist said. “In Tokyo you were a modenne, fighting for women’s rights. Here you find yourself in an ancient Japan that even your parents never knew. You find the local speech barbarous, the intellectual outlook bleak, and the aesthetic view of life nonexistent.” Dr. Yamazaki hesitated, then added, “You feel that if this is America, you had better go back to something better.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Akemi-san gulped, for she had not yet formulated that bitter conclusion, though for some time she had suspected its inevitability. Now, through the soft speech of another, the frightening words had been spoken. “Do many feel as I do, Yamazaki-sensei?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would it help you to know?” the young woman asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Indeed it would!” Akemi cried eagerly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You understand that my figures are only tentative . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Akemi laughed nervously and said, “It’s so good to hear a person use a word like tentative.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m afraid you’re bitter,” Dr. Yamazaki said reprovingly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Any more than the others?” Akemi asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think you reached me just at the right time,” Akemi said eagerly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The general pattern is this,” Dr. Yamazaki said, but before she could continue, Akemi interrupted and asked, “Would you think me a very silly girl, Yamazaki-sensei, if I said that I wanted to serve you tea? I am most terribly homesick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two women sat in silence as Akemi prepared tea in the ceremonial manner, and when the ritual was ended, Dr. Yamazaki continued: “Suppose that a hundred local soldiers married Japanese girls. Sixty of the husbands were Japanese. Thirty were Caucasians. Ten were Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How have the marriages worked out?” Akemi-san asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, if you take the thirty lucky girls who married Caucasians, about twenty-eight of them are quite happy. Some of the girls say they’re deliriously happy. They say they wouldn’t go back to Japan even if I gave them all of Hibiya Park.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They wouldn’t go back to Japan?” Akemi gasped. “Were they girls who were interested in books or plays or music?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Much like you. But you see, when a haole man marries a Japanese girl, his parents are so shocked that they make a true spiritual effort to like the girl. And when they meet someone like you, gentle, well-bred, sweet to their son, they overcompensate. They love her more than is required. They make her life a heaven on earth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do such people listen to music?” Akemi asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Usually a haole man hasn’t the nerve to marry a Japanese girl unless he’s rather sophisticated culturally. Such couples experience a very full spectrum.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Akemi looked glumly at the bleak walls of the Sakagawa home, with a four-tube radio invariably tuned to a station that alternated American jazz with Japanese hillbilly songs. Whenever she and Goro went to a movie it was invariably a chanbara, a Japanese western in which the samurai hero fought sixty armed villains without suffering a wound.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Japanese girls who marry Chinese soldiers,” Dr. Yamazaki continued, “face a different problem. The Chinese parents are totally disgusted and convinced that there is no possibility of their liking the unseen daughter-in-law, so they spend the time till she arrives hating her so much that when she finally gets here, they find she isn’t anywhere near as bad as they had feared. When she demonstrates that she really loves their son, everyone reaches a plateau of mutual respect, and things go reasonably well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the Japanese marriages?” Akemi asked. “You won’t dare say they go well.” ‘</p>

  <p class="normal">“Some do,” Dr. Yamazaki assured her. “Where farm boys here have married farm girls from Hiroshima-ken, things worked out rather well. But in a surprising number of cases, the Japanese-Japanese marriage does not do well. I think our figures are going to show that over fifty-five per cent of such marriages have run into trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” Akemi pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was born in Hawaii myself,” Dr. Yamazaki said. “From the very kind of family you married into. Stout Hiroshima peasants-- and remember that even in modern Hiroshima our Hawaii people would seem very old-fashioned. Anyhow, I’m partial to the local people. But the curious fact is this. The Caucasian mothers-in-law and the Chinese realize that they have to make a special effort to understand and love their strange new daughters. So they do so, and find happiness. The stolid Japanese mothers-in-law, and God help the Japanese girl who marries my brother and who has to put up with my mother . . . Well, it’s obvious. They all think they’re getting the kind of Japanese bride that used to flourish in southern Japan forty years ago. They make no effort to understand, so they haven’t the slightest chance of finding happiness with their new daughters.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know what’s killing my marriage?” Akemi asked bluntly. Dr. Yamazaki was not surprised at the forthrightness of the question, for she had watched the dissolution of several such marriages, but now Akemi paused, and it was apparent to Dr. Yamazaki that she was supposed to guess, so she volunteered: “In Japan young men are learning to accept new ways, but in Hawaii they have learned nothing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Akemi confessed. “Is that what the other girls say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They all say the same thing,” Dr. Yamazaki assured her. “But many of them outgrow their distaste, or somehow learn, to modify their husbands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But do you know what will keep me from doing that?” Akemi asked. “What cuts me to the heart day after day?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” the sociologist asked professionally.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The way they laugh at my correct speech. This I will not bear much longer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Yamazaki thought of her own family and smiled bitterly. “I have the same problem,” she laughed. “I have a Ph.D. degree.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, imitating her mother, she asked, ‘Do you think you’re better than we are, using such language?’ So at home, in self-defense, I talk pidgin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will not,” Akemi said. “I am an educated Japanese who has fought a long time for certain things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you love your husband,” Dr. Yamazaki said, “you will learn to accommodate yourself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To certain things, never,” Akemi said. Then she asked abruptly, “Have you ever been married, Yamazaki-sensei?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m engaged,” the sociologist replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To a local boy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, to a haole at the University of Chicago.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I see. You wouldn’t dare marry a local boy, would you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Dr. Yamazaki replied carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">Akemi tapped the sociologist’s notebook and laughed. “Now I’m embalmed in there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“One of many,” Dr. Yamazaki said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But can you guess where I’d like to be?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In a small coffee shop in the Nishi-Ginza, surrounded by exciting conversation on books and politics and music.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How could you guess so accurately?” Akemi asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because I’d like to be there, too,” Dr. Yamazaki confessed. “That’s where I met my fiance, so I know how lovely Japan can be. But I would say this, too. Hawaii can be just as exciting. To be a young Japanese here is possibly one of the most exhilarating experiences in the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you said you wouldn’t marry one of them,” Akemi-san reminded her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As a woman, seeking happiness in a relaxed home, I’ll stick with my haole from Chicago. But as a pure intellect, if I were not involved as a woman, I would much prefer to remain in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell me truthfully, Yamazaki-sensei, do you think that any society which has as its ideal a long, black automobile can ever be a good place to live?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Yamazaki considered the question for some moments and replied: “You must understand that the visible symbols of success which our Japanese here in Hawaii are following are those laid down by the established haole society. A big home, a powerful car, a boy going to Yale whether he learns anything or not . . . these are the symbols people living in Hawaii must accept. You can’t suddenly require the Japanese to prove themselves superior to the symbols upon which they’ve been raised.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For three years I’ve hoped my husband would,” Akemi said bitterly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Be patient,” Dr. Yamazaki pleaded, “and you’ll find Hawaii improving.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think not,” Akemi said slowly. “It’s a barren, stupid place and nothing will ever change it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two young women parted, and that night Dr. Yamazaki called Shig Sakagawa, whom she had known at Punahou, and said, “Shig, it’s none of my business, but your brother Goro is going to lose his wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You think so?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know so. She used every phrase the girls use before they catch the boat back to Japan. I’ve watched nineteen of them go back so far.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What could he do?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Buy her three Beethoven symphonies,” Dr. Yamazaki said, knowing that to blunt Goro such a step would be beyond the outer limits of imagination. Besides, Mrs. Sakagawa Senior would never allow such music in her house.</p>

  <p class="normal">WHILE the labor leader Goro Sakagawa faced these problems-- or rather did not face them--Hoxworth Hale was concerned principally with the forthcoming marriage of his daughter Noelani to her cousin twice removed, Whipple Janders, the son of bold, straightforward Hewlett Janders, on whom Hoxworth had grown to depend so much in recent years. At one time, when Noelani was younger, Hoxworth had rather hoped that she might go outside The Fort and find herself a completely new kind of husband . . . somebody from Yale, of course, but perhaps an easterner who had never seen Hawaii. For a while when Noelani was a senior at Wellesley she dated an Amherst boy, which was almost as good as Yale, but nothing had come of it, and when young Whip Janders, who was belatedly completing his Yale education, asked her to a spring dance at New Haven, each of them instinctively knew that they ought to marry. After all, they had known each other at Punahou; they were from families who understood each other; and Whip had been the closest friend of Noelani’s brother, who had been killed over Tokyo.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, at one point in. their engagement Noelani had experienced haunting doubts as to the propriety of their marriage, for Whipple had returned from the war somewhat changed. He was thinner, and his fashionable crew-cut did not entirely hide a tendency toward strongly individualistic behavior. Once at a Vassar dance he had appeared in formal dress but with a garish vest made of Hong Kong silk embroidered in purple dragons. He had been a sensation, but he had also been disturbing, for he had told one of the professors’ wives, “Thorstein Veblen would have loved this vest,” and she had stammered, “What?” and he had given his imitation of a dying tubercular patient, adding, “If you’re going to have consumption, it ought to be conspicuous.” It had been gruesomely funny, but unfortunately the professor’s wife didn’t catch on.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Whip and his crew-cut were back in Honolulu, dressed in Brooks Brothers’ most austere fashion, and the wedding was about to take place. Shortly before the event, Noelani asked her father, for her mother was in one of her spells and could not comprehend questions, “Do you think it’s proper for kids like us to go on intermarrying, Dad? I mean, frankly, what are the chances that our children will be more like Mother than like you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In considerable embarrassment, for this was the nagging fear that had made him hope that Noelani would marry some easterner, Hoxworth dodged the question and suggested: “Why don’t we look into this with Aunt Lucinda. We always ask her about the family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Which family?” Noelani asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The family … all of it,” Hoxworth replied, and he drove his daughter up to see Aunt Lucinda in the mist-haunted house in Nuuanu Valley. When they arrived, they found that she was entertaining half a dozen ladies of nearly her own age, and most of them were drinking gin, so that the conversation wasn’t exactly on focus, but there was a sweet, relaxed gentility about it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is my great-niece, on my grandmother’s side, Noelani Hale,” Lucinda explained graciously, whisking her pale-blue lace handkerchief toward the girl. “She’s Malama Janders Hale’s daughter, and on Saturday she’s going to marry that fine young Whipple Janders, who is the great-grandson of Clement and Jerusha Hewlett.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At once, Noelani’s place in the great succession was established, and the women smiled at her admiringly, one saying, “I knew your husband’s great-grandmother Jerusha very well, Noelani. She was a marvelous women and could play polo better than the men. If young Whipple has her blood, he’ll be a stalwart man, I can assure you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What Noelani came to ask about,” Aunt Lucinda explained, “is the extent to which she is related to Whip, and I would like to say right now that in my opinion it’s a good deal safer to marry into a substantial island family, whose blood lines are known, than into some purely speculative mainland family whose backgrounds could have originated God knows where.” The women all agreed to this, and a Japanese maid in crisp white took their cups for more tea or their glasses for more gin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The only possible question about the marriage of Noelani and Whip,” Aunt Lucinda began, “is that each of them,” and she lowered her voice, “does have a strain of Hawaiian blood. If you go back to her great-great grandmother on her father’s side, you find Malama Hoxworth, who was the daughter of Captain Rafer Hoxworth, who was not a missionary but who was a most marvelous and courtly gentleman of the finest character and breeding. Of course, he married Noelani Kanakoa, the last Alii Nui, but I think it safe to say that the Malama of whom we are speaking . . . the one that married the great Micah Hale, that is … well anyway . . .” and with an airy gesture she dismissed the whole matter. One of the most gratifying aspects of talking with Aunt Lucinda was that she threw out so many names that you didn’t really have to listen, for when she found herself hopelessly involved in family lines she stopped and started over again. Now she switched abruptly and said, with no one able to guess how she had arrived at the conclusion, “Anyway, no finer gentleman ever lived in Hawaii than Captain Rafer Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Japanese maid brought back the drinks, and Aunt Lucinda asked, “Where was I? Oh, yes. So from that unfortunate marriage of Micah to the half-caste girl Malama . . . You know, I often wondered where Micah got the courage to appear in public so much when he was saddled with such a marriage. Well, anyway, our little Noelani here does have a strain of Hawaiian blood, but it’s more than overcome, I should think, by the Hale and Whipple strains, except that the Whipple girl her great-grandfather married was not from what I like to call the uncontaminated Whipples, to which I belong, but from the branch that married into the Hewletts, which as you know were also half-castes, except for the first boy who married Lucy Hale, from whom I am descended.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The mists from the Pali began to fill the valley, and a waterfall echoed mournfully as Aunt Lucinda continued her analysis of the family lines. Most of the meandering comments she made were meaningless to her listeners, but since all were descended from these early ancestors who had done so much to build Hawaii, each kept in the back of her mind some three or four specially prized progenitors to whom she attributed her character, and whenever Aunt Lucinda mentioned one of those names, that listener snapped to attention through the gin and nodded with special approval. Through the years Lucinda had noticed that three names in particular evoked veneration: it was best to be descended from Jerusha Bromley Hale, the great missionary mother; or from Rafer Hoxworth, the courtly and gracious sea captain; or from Dr. John Whipple, the patrician intellect. Aunt Lucinda, with modesty, could point out that she was descended from two of the three, and in a way she was happy that she was not related to Captain Hoxworth, for of course all of his offspring were part Hawaiian.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s not that I’m against Hawaiians,” she assured her visitors. “It’s just that I get frightfully irritated at the hero-worship that goes on around here over the so-called Hawaiian royalty. I sit in the library and I can spot every malihini girl who is going to ask me, ‘Do you have that book on Kelly Kanakoa?’ I have to stop myself from warning them, ‘You’ll have to put your chewing gum away while you look at the pictures.’ And when she hands the book back reverently she always says, ‘Gee, his grandfather was a king!’ As if that meant anything. I’ve always thought it was one of the most ridiculous aspects of Hawaiian life, the way they memorize these pathetic old lists of kings, as if a litany of imaginary names meant anything. You remember what Abner Hale, he was my great-grandfather, wrote about such ancestor worship: ‘I think it impedes Hawaii as much as any other one thing, for the poor fools are so attentive to their past that they have no time to contemplate eternity.’ And nothing makes me more irritated than the way a Hawaiian will point to some pathetic dregs of humanity and say accusingly, ‘If the missionaries hadn’t interfered, he would now be our king,’ as if we had halted something fine and good. Do you know who the present king of Hawaii would be if the missionaries hadn’t put a stop to such nonsense? The beachboy Kelly Kanakoa! Have you ever heard him speak? He insists on using a vocabulary of about ninety words, half of them blalah. Everybody Kelly likes is blalah except that he calls me his seestah.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth coughed and his aunt collected her thoughts. “Oh yes, now about Whipple Janders. He went to Punahou and Yale, as you know, and had a very good record in the war. Handsome boy, but not so fleshy as his father, which is understandable, because Hewlett takes after the Hewlett side of the family, and they were always unprepossessing types, if you’ll allow me to say so, Abigail, because as you know Abraham married a Hawaiian . . . well, he picked up a Hawaiian wahine after Urania died, but that’s neither here nor there.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suppose what you’re really interested in is how the intended bridegroom Whipple relates to the Hales. If you’ll go back to Micah, who married the half-caste girl Malama Hoxworth, you’ll remember that he had two children, Ezra and Mary, and Ezra of course was your great-grandfather, Noelani, and that takes care of that.” The Japanese maid returned to pass coconut chips, toasted a delicious salty brown. “You may fill tie glasses, too, Kimiko,” Aunt Lucinda reminded her.</p>

  <p class="normal">She never got back to Mary Hale, Micah’s daughter, but the group understood that somehow Mary was related to Whipple Janders, but what Aunt Lucinda did say was perhaps of greater importance: “So you can see that Whipple comes from some of the finest stock in the islands. For three generations, Whipples have married Janderses, which accounts in part, I suppose, for the way in which their family fortunes have been conserved.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Turning directly to Noelani, the beautiful girl who was soon to be married, Lucinda said, “I can think of no one you could have chosen finer than Whipple Janders, and I am extremely happy for you, Noelani. When I look at your marvelous face I see your great-great-grandfather Micah Hale, the savior of these islands. You have his high forehead, his courage and his force of character. But your beauty comes from the Whipples. Isn’t it strange,” she asked the hushed group, “how the seed of one handsome man could have produced so much beauty in these islands? I know it’s fashionable to laugh at old maids who haven’t married, and I’m sure you’ll think me vain if I claim that when I was young I too was a typical Whipple beauty. Kimiko, fetch me that portrait in the bedroom!” And the Japanese maid silently brought in one of the last great portraits completed by Sargent, and it showed a glowing young beauty in white, with lace and combs, and Lucinda said, “That’s what I mean by the Whipple complexion. You have it, Noelani, and it’s a great consolation to me to think that it will be reunited with the male side of the Whipple family. What handsome children you are bound to have!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The maid stood awkwardly with the heavy picture, and Miss Lucinda said, “You may take it back, Kimiko.” And when the maid was gone she confided: “Sargent did that of me when I was engaged to an Englishman, but Father felt that it would be better if I found a young man closer to home, and as you know I became engaged to my cousin Horace Whipple, but he . . .” She hesitated; then realizing that all of her listeners except perhaps Noelani knew the story anyway, she concluded: “Before the wedding Horace shot himself. At first it was suspected that he might have stolen money from J &amp; W, but of course that was quickly disproved, for there has never been a case of theft in the family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Which family?” Noelani asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The family. All of us,” Aunt Lucinda replied, and when her nephew Hoxworth had departed with his attractive daughter, she summoned Kimiko to refill the glasses, remarking, “That Noelani is one of the loveliest these islands have ever produced. She did marvelously well at Wellesley, and I think we’re lucky that she’s come home to marry with her proper kind. After all, she comes from excellent stock.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a major characteristic of Hawaii that everyone claimed distinguished ancestors. In 1949 there were no Hawaiians who were not descended from kings. The Hales had constructed the myth that cantankerous old Abner from the miserable farm near Marlboro had been, were the truth known, of knightly ancestry dating far back in English history. The Kees never mentioned the fact that their progenitor was a shifty little gambler who had bought his concubine from a Macao whorehouse; he was, if you listened closely, something of a Confucian scholar. And even Mrs. Yoriko Sakagawa always loved to tell her children, “Remember that on your mother’s side you come from samurai stock.” Of all these gentle fables, only Mrs. Sakagawa’s was true. In 1703 the great Lord of Hiroshima had had as one of his flunkies a stocky, stupid oaf whose principal job it was to stand with a feathered staff warning away chance intruders when his lord was going to the toilet. Technically, this male chambermaid was a samurai, but he had been too stupid even to hold the toilet signal well, and after a while had been discharged and sent back to his home village, where he married a local girl and became the ancestor of Yoriko Sakagawa; and if she, like the others in Hawaii, derived consolation from her supposed illustrious heritage, no harm was done.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hale-Janders wedding was a splendid affair, held in the flower-decked old missionary church, with Reverend Timothy Hewlett officiating; but as I said earlier, it only seemed that Goro Sakagawa was having more domestic trouble than his adversary, Hoxworth Hale, for Noelani and Whipple had been married only four months when Whipple suddenly announced, out of a clear blue sky if ever an announcement were so made: “I just don’t love you, Noelani.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” she asked in heartbroken astonishment.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m going to live in San Francisco,” he said simply.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is there some other girl?” Noelani pleaded, without shame.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. I guess I just don’t like girls,” he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whip!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s nothing wrong with you, Noe, but Eddie Shane and I are taking an apartment.&#160; He’s the fellow I was with in the air corps.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, my God, Whip! Have you talked with anyone about this?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, Noel Don’t make a federal case of it, please. Marriage isn’t for me, that’s all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you’re willing to marry Eddie Shane, is that it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you want to put it that way, all right. I am.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He left Hawaii, and word filtered back that he and Eddie Shane had a large apartment in the North Beach area of San Francisco, where Eddie made ceramics which were featured in Life magazine, in color.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aunt Lucinda loved to explain what had happened. She said, as Kimiko passed the gin, “Go back to Micah Hale’s daughter, Mary. This girl was one-eighth Hawaiian, through her mother Malama Hoxworth, who was the daughter of Noelani Kanakoa, the last Alii Nui. Now that’s bad enough, but as you know, Mary Hale married a Janders, and you’d expect that rugged stock to have counterbalanced the weak Hawaiian strain, but unfortunately she married into the Janders’ line that had married one of the Hewlett girls, and as you know, they were Hawaiian. So poor Whipple Janders, when he ran off with the air corps man, was only doing what could be expected, because he had Hawaiian blood from both sides of his family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Hoxworth Hale, seeing the effect of this pathetic marriage on his high-strung daughter Noelani, thought: “Unless I can help her, there’s going to be another woman sitting upstairs in the late afternoons.” But what help he should offer, he did not know.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1951 Nyuk Tsin engineered her last big coup for the Kee hui, and in many ways it was her most typical accomplishment, for it derived from intelligence and was attained through courage. She was a hundred and four years old, sitting in her ugly house up Nuuanu listening to her grandson Harvey read the paper to her, when, in a shaky old voice, she interrupted: “What’s that again?” Since Harvey was reading in English and speaking in Hakka, he could not be certain that he himself understood the confusing story, so phrase by phrase he repeated: “In American business today it is possible for a company which is losing money to be more valuable than it was a few years ago when it was making money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Impetuously the old matriarch forced her grandson to read the strange concept three times, and when she had comprehended it she said in her piping voice, “That’s exactly the kind of trick smart haoles think up for themselves and which we stupid Chinese never catch on to until it’s too late.” Accordingly, she summoned her great-grandson Eddie, Hong Kong’s boy, whom she had sent to Harvard Law School, and told him: “I want a complete report on how this works.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At that time not much was known in Hawaii relating to this marriage of losing companies to those that were prosperous, but Eddie Kee applied himself to the task of assembling opinions from mainland tax courts, and within two months he was an expert in the field. Then, with several tax reports airmailed in from New York he reported back to his great-grandmother in her little house, and when he came upon her she was picking lint from a shawl, and he thought: “How can she be so old and yet so interested?” “Can you explain it now?” she asked in a high, cackling voice. “Fundamentally,” Eddie began in his best professional style, “it’s an old law and a good one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t care whether it’s good or bad,” Nyuk Tsin interrupted, her voice suddenly lower. “What I want to know is how it works.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Take the Janders Brewery. For years it’s been losing money. Now suppose next year it makes money. It won’t have to pay any taxes because recent years’ losses can be used to offset next year’s gains.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Makes sense,” Nyuk Tsin nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But look at what else we can do,” Eddie lectured stolidly, as if addressing a class of legal students. “If the Kee hui buys the brewery, we can then add to its assets all of our old pineapple land. Then if the brewery sells the land, the profits will be offset by the past losses of the brewery. Do you see what that means, Wu Chow’s Auntie?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Little Nyuk Tsin did not reply. She sat in the late afternoon sun like a winsome old lady embroidered on a Chinese silk. She was smiling, and if an outsider had seen her beatific, wrinkled face he might have thought: “She’s dreaming of an old love.” But he would have been wrong. She was dreaming of the Janders Brewery, and she said, “How heavenly! We can use the Janders’ losses to balance the Kee profits!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Auntie!” Eddie cried. “You see exactly what I’m talking about.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I’m afraid you don’t see what I’ve been talking about,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Eddie asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Suppose that we do buy the Janders Brewery and do hide our pineapple lands inside it . . .” she began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what I’ve been explaining,” Eddie said gently. It was the first sign that day that Wu Chow’s Auntie was losing her acuity.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what I’m explaining,” Nyuk Tsin said firmly, “is that after we have done this clever thing we will put some member of our family in charge of the brewery, and he will give it good management and he will turn what has been a loss into a profit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the beatific smile passed over to Eddie’s face and he said, “If you could arrange that, Wu Chow’s Auntie, we’d make a fortune.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what I had in mind,” the old woman replied. “This law seems to have been expressly written for the Kee hui. It is our duty to use it sagaciously.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She summoned Hong Kong, and after discussing the theory of the law, told him abruptly, “Make us up a list of all the companies in Honolulu that are losing big money. Then write alongside each one the name of someone in our hui who could turn that loss into a profit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where will we get the money to buy the sick companies?” Hong Kong parried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t have to buy them for cash,” Nyuk Tsin replied, “but we’ll need money for down payments. So we have to sell some of our holdings now and pay the taxes on our profits, but if the plan works we’ll more than make up for those taxes in the end.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you determined to go ahead on such a wild scheme?” Hong Kong asked. “Getting rid of profitable businesses in order to take a big gamble?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin reflected a moment, then asked Eddie, “Does anyone else in Honolulu understand how this law works?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They must know,” the Harvard man replied, “but they aren’t doing anything about it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin made up her mind. Clapping her hands sharply she said, “We’ll go ahead. In six months everyone will know what we’re doing, but by then there’ll be nothing left to buy.” And as Hong Kong and his son departed, old Nyuk Tsin looked at the back of the latter and thought: “I wonder what his education at Harvard cost us? It’s been worth rubies and jade.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The next day Hong Kong returned to the weather-beaten old house up Nuuanu with his homework well done. Spreading papers which Nyuk Tsin could not read, he indicated all the businesses that had accumulated large losses: the brewery, a taxicab company, a chain of bakeries, some old office buildings, some stores. But now the perpetual drive of Nyuk Tsin manifested itself with unbroken force, and as each item was listed she asked simply, “How much fee-simple land does it have?” And if Hong Kong said that it owned no fend of its own, she snorted: “Strike it off. Even better than accumulated back losses is land.” So the final list that the Kees were going to buy contained only companies with big losses and bigger parcels of land.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when Nyuk Tsin heard Hong Kong’s second list--the Kee holdings that were to be liquidated to cover the new purchases-- she perceived with displeasure that the biggest project of all was missing, and she wondered why. Beginning querulously and with a piping voice she said, “This is a good list, Hong Kong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong smiled and observed expansively: “Well, I thought we might as well get rid of the old projects.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But if I heard your list correctly,” Nyuk Tsin continued softly, “there was no suggestion that we sell the land upon which we are now sitting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong looked with some embarrassment at his son Eddie, but neither spoke, so Nyuk Tsin continued: “Surely, if we need money for new ventures, we ought to sell first of all this old taro patch. And everything on it. Didn’t you think of that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In a burst of confidence Hong Kong said, “Of course we thought of it, Wu Chow’s Auntie. But we considered this land too precious to you. We cannot sell it during your lifetime.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank you, Hong Kong,” the old woman replied, bowing her thin gray head. “But one of the reasons why this idea of selling old businesses to go into new is appealing to me is that we will not only make money but we will also be forced into many new operations. We will have to work and will not be allowed to grow lazy and fat.” She folded her hands, smiled at her clever men and added, “Have you noticed, Hong Kong, how every Chinese family that tries to hold on to old businesses loses everything in the end?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you always preached to us, ‘Hold on to the land!’” Hong Kong protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, yes!” Nyuk Tsin agreed. “But not always the same land.” Then she added, “Old land and old ideas must be constantly surrendered.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A new concept had come into the room, a concept of change and going-forwardness, and for some moments Hong Kong and his son contemplated the old woman’s vision of a great family always in flux and always working hard to profit from it. The silence was broken by Nyuk Tsin, who said, “So we must sell this precious old land, Hong Kong, and in our liquidation, let it be the first to go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The land we will sell,” Hong Kong said quietly, “but we will keep the old house for a little while longer. I could not imagine you living anywhere else.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank you, my dutiful grandson,” Nyuk Tsin replied. Then, briskly, she added, “So we must start this day teaching Bill how to run a brewery. Sam must study how to make money from bakeries, and I want Tom to begin reading about new ideas in architecture for old buildings.” She proposed ways by which every losing venture they were about to buy could be transformed into a money-maker, and she warned: “Hong Kong, you must study carefully to see that we acquire only the best land. Eddie, organize everything in the best business procedure. I must depend upon you two to keep your eyes on everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As the meeting was about to break up, the old matriarch said, “It’s very exciting to see a family launching out into bold new projects. You’ll be proud of this day, but remember, Hong Kong, as you buy, be very secret, and do it all at once. And when you buy, always allow yourself to be forced into paying a little more than the seller has a right to hope for. When your plan is understood by all, nobody must feel he’s been cheated.” She paused, then added, “But don’t pay too much more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Three weeks later, at a meeting of The Fort, bluff Hewlett Janders laughed and said, “If we didn’t follow the old missionary law about no alcohol here, I’d send out and buy drinks all around.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good news?” John Whipple Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The best. Just managed to unload the brewery. What a millstone it’s been. My sainted grandmother told me once, if she told me a hundred&#160; times,&#160; ‘No&#160; good&#160; will come of a&#160; Hale going into&#160; the brewery business.’ And she was so right.” “Get a good price for it?” Hoxworth Hale asked. “I got thirty-five thousand more than I ever hoped to,” Janders replied. “I’ve been wanting to stick Hong Kong Kee ever since he pulled that fast one in buying the Gregory’s leases.” “Did you say Hong Kong?” Hoxworth asked. “Yes. He slipped this time. Nobody can make money from that brewery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s odd,” Hale said. “I just sold Hong Kong the old Bromley Block. It’s been losing money for years.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point one of the Hewletts arrived with the good news that he had unloaded the taxicab company. “To Hong Kong Kee?” a chorus asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, and at a good price,” young Hewlett replied. A gray silence fell over the board room while Hale looked at Janders and Janders at Hewlett. “Have we been made fools of?” Hoxworth asked slowly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally dour John, Whipple Hoxworth said, glumly, “I guess it’s my turn to confess. I just sold Hong Kong that chain of bakeries we started before the war. Big losers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s he up to?” Hewlett Janders cried. “What’s that tricky Chinaman up to?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It must be real estate. He’s buying property just to get real estate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” one of the young Hewletts interrupted. “Because he just sold the old Kee taro patch. For a million five.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My God!” Janders choked. “He’s selling, he’s buying. What’s that wily sonofabitch up to?” The men looked at one another in exasperation, not so much because they were angry at Hong Kong, as because they suspected that he had some clever deal cooking, one which they ought to have anticipated for themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">The deal was clever; in truth it was, but only the first half. Anyone, if he had had the advice of a hard-working lawyer like Eddie Kee, could have bought losing firms and sold prosperous ones, making a nice profit on the transaction. That was clever. But what really counted was the fact that Bill Kee, backstopped by his father Hong Kong and his smart brother Eddie, was learning how to brew fairly good beer.</p>

  <p class="normal">It wasn’t easy, and some of the first batches, introduced by a florid advertising hullabaloo featuring the slogan “Kee Beer, Your Key to Happiness,” was dreadful stuff which the local population christened “Chinese arsenic.” But soon, with the aid of a Swiss-German whom the hui flew in from St. Louis, the beer began to taste reasonably palatable, and since it sold for a nickel a can less than others, workingmen began acquiring a taste for it. So without even considering the $1,800,000 worth of real estate on, which the old Janders Brewery had sat, the Kee hui made a very strong profit out of that particular tax purchase.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the big money-maker, to everyone’s surprise, turned out to be the bakeries. Each store brought with it enough real estate so that of itself the deal was favorable, but Sam Kee, at the age of sixty-four, discovered a real affinity for selling cakes, and he showed substantial profits on each unit in the chain.</p>

  <p class="normal">Not all the projects turned out so well. For example, the taxicab company resisted every attempt to make it pay, and finally Hong Kong reported to his grandmother: “This one is no good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Give it away,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hate to surrender so easily,” Hong Kong protested. “There ought to be some way to make money out of taxicabs.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Somebody else probably can,” Nyuk Tsin agreed. “But not the Kees. Anyway, I don’t like taxis. They seem to aim at me whenever I go out. By the way, I saw what Tom is doing to the old Bromley Block, and he’s making it into quite a handsome building. If we had traded even, giving away the taro patch for the Bromley Block, we’d still have been ahead. I like to see the family working,” she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">And as the year ended, her hundred and fourth, she sat in her little house at midnight, and with a flickering oil lamp she undressed, until she stood completely naked, a tremendously frail old woman made up mostly of bones, and with the lamp moving cautiously near her body she inspected herself for leprosy. There were no spots on her hands, none on her torso, none on her legs. Now she sat down and lifted in turn each of her ungainly big feet. There were no spots on the toes, none on the heel, none at the ankles. At peace for another night, she slipped into a flannel nightgown, blew out the lamp, and went to sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">The coup which Nyuk Tsin had engineered had one unexpected result. The Fort, after it had an opportunity to study exactly what Hong Kong Kee had accomplished by his revolutionary manipulations, concluded, in the words of Hoxworth Hale: “We could use a man like that on some of our boards,” and everyone agreed that the man had a master intellect.</p>

  <p class="normal">After one of the meetings of Whipple Oil Imports, Incorporated, Hoxworth asked his fellow board member, jokingly, “Hong Kong, now that the Gregory’s deal is over, and nobody got too badly hurt, are you happy that you sneaked the outfit into Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Hong Kong asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well,” Hoxworth pointed out amiably, for he was growing to like the clever Chinese whose business judgments usually proved sound, “Gregory’s has been here for nearly five years. They’ve taken enormous sums out of the Territory, but what have they done for Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like what?” Hong Kong asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like museums, schools, libraries, medical foundations.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong thought a while and said in apparent seriousness, “Every year the manager of Gregory’s has his picture in the paper handing the community drive a check for three hundred dollars.” Hale looked at his new friend in astonishment, and saw that Hong Kong was laughing. “They don’t do very much for Hawaii,” the Chinese admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And as the years go by, Hong Kong, you’ll see that they do even less. You have a lot of Kees in Hawaii, Hong Kong. How many?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We figure that the old grandmother has over two hundred great-great-grandchildren, but not all of them are in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you ever thought that each one of them will be cheated just a little bit if there are no new museums or orchestras? Put it the other way, doesn’t everyone of your family who grows up here go to college on the mainland a little bit stronger because of what the old families did for the islands?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re right!” Hong Kong agreed hastily. “And nobody expects Gregory’s to copy you. But it looks to me, Hoxworth, as if we’re entering a new age. We don’t have to have handouts from above any longer. We pay good wages. We tax. We get the economy moving real fast. Everybody is better off. Even you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you ever heard of an art museum financed by taxation? Do you think the smart young Japanese who are coming up so fast will put aside one penny for a good university or an orchestra? Will a dozen Gregory’s ever make a decent society?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hoxworth, you’re going to be surprised,” Hong Kong assured him. “When we get a functioning democracy here, our boys are going to vote for museums, universities, medical clinics. And they’ll tax their own people like hell to pay for them. Hawaii will be the paradise people used to talk about.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t believe it,” Hoxworth argued. “The good society is always the reflection of a few men who had the courage to do the right thing. It is never voted into being. It is never accomplished if it’s left to the Gregory’s of the world.” But when they parted he said something&#160; that&#160; would&#160; have&#160; been&#160;&#160; totally&#160; unthinkable&#160;&#160; two&#160; years earlier:&#160; “By the way, Hong Kong, if you spot any smart young Japanese who are as intelligent as you are, let me know.” “What do you have in mind?” Hong Kong asked. “You’re doing so well on our boards we thought it might be a good idea . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It would be,” Hong Kong said quickly. “If you pick up young Shigeo Sakagawa, you’ll be getting a winner.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Isn’t he running for senator … on the Democratic ticket?” “Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How could I take such a man onto our boards?” Hoxworth asked. “You won’t find any good young Japanese running on the Republican ticket,” Hong Kong said flatly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are you, Hong Kong?” Hale asked. “When I was poor, I was a Democrat. Now that I have responsibilities, I’m a Republican. But I make my campaign contributions only to smart young men like Shigeo .. . and they always seem to be Democrats.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s talk about this again, after the election,” Hoxworth said, and for the first time he started listening to Shigeo Sakagawa’s campaign speeches. But as the campaign grew hotter, he heard Shig saying one night: “All over the world nations have had to fight for land reform. In England they accomplished it by the vote, and things went well. In France they had to have a bloody revolution, and all went badly. I have worked in Japan for General MacArthur, giving great landed estates to the peasants, and all the time I worked there I said to myself, ‘I ought to be home in Hawaii, doing the same thing.’ Because I knew what you know. Hawaii is generations behind the times. Our land is held by a few big families, and they lease it out to us in niggardly amounts as they see fit . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The young fool’s a communist,” Hale snorted as he turned off the radio, and there was no more talk about inviting Shigeo Sakagawa to join The Fort.</p>

  <p class="normal">AFTER the presidential elections in 1952, Congressman Clyde V. Carter of the Thirty-ninth District in Texas appointed himself a committee of one to investigate--for the fourteenth time-- Hawaii’s fitness for statehood. He reached Honolulu in mid-December bearing with him only three minor prejudices: he hated to the point of nausea anyone who wasn’t a white man; he knew from experience that rich men were the saviors of the republic; and he loathed Republicans. Thus he was not completely happy in Hawaii, where rich men were invariably Republicans, and where sixty per cent of the people he met were obviously not Caucasian. In the first five minutes he decided: “This place must never be a state.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was therefore surprised when the welcoming committee, consisting of Hoxworth Hale, Whipple Janders and Black Jim Mc-Lafferty, head of the Democratic Party in the islands, gave florid but hard-hitting defenses of statehood. He was particularly impressed by what Hoxworth Hale cried over the loud-speaker: “We are an American community here, with American ideals, American standards of public behavior and a truly American system of education. Congressman Carter, we citizens of Hawaii want you to move among us as a brother. Stop anyone you see. Ask any questions you please. We are here to be inspected. We have no secrets.” The crowd applauded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Black Jim McLafferty was also impressive. He said in a flowing brogue, “Today we citizens of God’s fairest group of islands welcome a distinguished congressman from the great State of Texas. We know, Congressman Carter, that our terrain, magnificent though it is, would be lost in the confines of your vast kingdom of Texas. I am reminded, sir, of a story I heard while serving with the air corps in England, when a loyal son of Texas, somewhat under the influence of Scotch, that wonderful beverage, shouted in a local pub, ‘Why, Texas is so big, you can get on a train at El Paso and travel all day and all night and all the next day and all the next night, and when you wake up the next morning, where are you? You’re still in Texas!’ And the Englishman replied, ‘I know how it is, Jack. We got trains like that in England, too.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the crowd chuckled, the congressman bowed graciously and raised his hand to Black Jim, whereupon the Democrat continued: “But what may surprise you about Hawaii, sir, is that although you have always heard that these islands are rock-ribbed Republican^ which is probably why you voted against statehood at the last two sessions, I want to tell you here and now that the islands are going to be Democratic, and even though my good friend Hoxworth Hale is doing his very damnedest to keep them Republican, I’m doing just the opposite to make them Democratic, so that when you finally admit us to the Union, sir, you will be able to boast to your constituents, ‘I’m responsible for bringin’ Hawaii into the Union, yassuh. Best Democratic state in America, after Texas.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">This prospect so intrigued the congressman that he asked if he could meet with McLafferty, so the Irishman, never one to miss the pregnant moment, volunteered: “Ride into town with me, and we can talk.” To the dismay of the welcoming committee, who had planned things rather differently, big, comfortable Congressman Carter settled down beside Black Jim as the latter steered his 1949 Pontiac—”Never drive a better car than fifty per cent of the people who have to vote for you,” his father had decreed, and Black Jim had found it a good rule.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do the islands really want statehood?” Carter asked, glad to be in private with a practicing politician.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sir, you can believe this one fact. The islands want to be a state.” “Why?” Carter asked. “We treat them real well in Congress.” “I’m sure that’s what George the Third said about the colonies. Parliament treats them decently. Why do they want self-government?’ That’s why we fought the Revolution.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This marvelous bit of sophistry was quite lost on Carter, for as a boy he had lived along the Mexican border and the word revolution had no appeal to him whatever; were he able to repeal American history he would have done so, and the Thirteen Colonies would have gained their independence by the efforts of gentlemen in powdered wigs who made polite speeches. “What would you have under statehood that you now don’t have?” he asked coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“People usually answer that with some statement about taxation without representation, or the fact that under statehood we’d elect our own governor. But I have only one explanation, sir. If we were a state, we’d either elect or appoint our own judges.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you do so now?” Carter asked, for like most visitors to the islands, he knew nothing about them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Indeed we don’t,” Black Jim said with feeling. “They’re appointed from Washington, and even when we have Democratic presidents, they usually appoint worn-out mainland Republicans.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How does that hurt you?” asked Carter, who had once been a judge himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re a feudal society here . . .” McLafferty began, but again, he used the wrong word, for the South Texas which Carter represented was also feudal, and as he recalled his happy youth, he rather felt that this was one of the better patterns of life. As McLafferty droned on, the congressman reflected: “By God, under a benevolent feudalism you didn’t have Mexicans trying to tell decent men! . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So the one vital thing,” McLafferty concluded, “is to have judges from the islands. Because in our peculiar society here in Hawaii, the judges decide all the things that really matter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s so wrong about that?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Congressman!” Black Jim cried, as he dodged a truck. “Hey, you! Manuelo!” he shouted at the Filipino. “You look good next time, maybe, eh?” And the little brown man yelled something back, happily, for that evening he would be able to tell his friends at the sugar plantation: “This afternoon I had a talk with Black Jim McLafferty.” All the plantation hands knew him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I was saying,” the Irishman continued, “was that as long as judges from the mainland control the great trusts and the land laws, it’s easy for the rich local Republicans to control the judges. Well, not control them, because our judges have been reasonably honest men, legally speaking, but the rich Republicans get next to them, and court decisions usually follow their interests.” The more Carter heard about Hawaii, the less need he saw for change. In Texas, too, society was subtly rigged so that rich Democrats stayed fairly close to judges and legislators and got things&#160; their way. “Frankly,” Carter thought, “what’s wrong with that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was therefore not too pleased with McLafferty—had him tagged as one of those radical northerners who call themselves Democrats—when the biggest blow of the day came. Black Jim had his offices on the ground floor of a building on Hotel Street, at the grubby edge of Chinatown, where Japanese and Filipino workmen were not afraid to visit him, and as he brought his car to the curb, Carter gasped: “Why these people are all slant-eyes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Almost half of the people in the islands are,” McLafferty said offhandedly. “Some of the best citizens you ever saw. Only trouble I find is that most of the damned Chinese are Republicans. But I’m trying to change that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can they be trusted?” Carter asked in honest fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe you better meet one of them,” McLafferty laughed. “And there’s no better one to meet than my partner . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Carter did not hear the words, for he saw to his astonishment that McLafferty, the head of the Democratic Party in Hawaii, had as his partner a Japanese: McLafferty and Sakagawa. And when Black Jim kicked open the door, the congressman saw, from the big poster inside, that this Japanese was running for office: “Sakagawa for Senator.” And finally, beneath the poster he saw the Japanese himself, a crisp, crew-cut young man. with polished manners and quiet deportment. Shigeo Sakagawa stuck out his hand and said, with a slight Boston accent, “Congressman Carter, we are proud indeed to welcome you to Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The next moment was an agonizing one, for Shig’s hand stayed out; the congressman, who had never before seen a Japanese face-to-face, simply could not take it. His jaw dropped as if he had been hit over the head by a falling oil derrick, and he stared at the fearsome, curious man before him. The expression on Shig’s handsome face did not change as he lowered his hand. Belatedly Carter started to accept the greeting, moving his right hand slightly, but by then he saw that Shig had dropped his. Black-browed Mc-Lafferty, whom nothing fazed, said brightly, “Young Shig’s going to be our first Democratic senator. He’s going to win the unexpired term in the Nineteenth District.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good luck,” Carter said awkwardly. “We need Democrats.” He backed out of the office into the street, where the passing Orientals frightened him as he had rarely been scared in his life. Then, with a sigh of profound relief, he saw the big black automobiles of Hoxworth Hale and Hewlett Janders swing into view on Hotel Street, and he ran up to the cars as if their occupants were his brothers.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll go now,” he gasped with relief. Quickly jumping in beside Hale, and feeling himself secure at last in the Cadillac, he waved professionally at McLafferty and called, “Best of luck in the campaign.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the big black cars had moved away, Black Jim started laughing. Slapping his leg, he returned to his office and continued laughing. “Shig,” he cried, “hold out your hand!” And as Shig did so, his partner gave a hilarious burlesque of an American congressman, the friend of the people, desperately afraid to touch one of the people. “Shig,” he laughed, “there’s one vote for statehood we better not count on. But don’t you worry about it, son. Do you know why I hauled that fat-ass sonofabitch down here to our offices? Not to give him a pitch about statehood, because what he thinks concerns me not at all. Look at the crowds outside! They’re impressed that a United States congressman came down to Hotel Street to see you. Now get out there and walk over to the mailbox, casually, and post something.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t give a damn what. Fold up a piece of paper and stick it in the mailbox, as if you had congressmen visiting you all the time. And speak pleasantly to everybody.” So Shig walked out among his constituents and acquired great face.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the meantime, one of the recurring miracles of Hawaii was taking place. In the Roosevelt-Truman years, from 1932 to 1952, thousands of important Democratic politicians and officials passed through the islands, but they rarely saw any Democrats. At the airport or the dock they were met by either Hoxworth Hale or Hewlett Janders or by trim little John Whipple Hoxworth, and they were whisked away to the big houses of The Fort. They were fed well, wined to perfection, and told what to believe. Sometimes when the Japanese maids, in crisp white uniforms, had withdrawn, a Roosevelt appointee would ask timorously, “These Japanese, can they be trusted?” And The Fort invariably replied, “We’ve had Sumiko for eighteen years, and we’ve never known a better or more loyal maid.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At such parties the Roosevelt appointees met military leaders and stout island judges and cool, sharp Hoxworth Hale. Together these people created the impression of a solid citizenry, one that avoided scandal, one that honestly intended doing well, and one that was certainly content with things as they were. At public meetings the two men who could always be counted upon to give rousing speeches on behalf of statehood for Hawaii were Hoxworth Hale and John Whipple Hoxworth, and visiting statesmen were impressed by the arguments marshaled by these advocates, but in the privacy or The Fort these very men, without saying anything, always managed to convey an impression exactly the opposite of their speeches.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale always found occasion to comment: “There is one thing about our islands that you must not overlook. We have the finest judges in America.” He would pause and then add, “We would truly deplore the day when Oriental lawyers, untrained in American values, took over the judgeships. We fear that the American way of life would be terminated at that instant.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not that the Orientals aren’t brilliant,” John Whipple Hoxworth usually interposed. “Perhaps clever’s the word I’m looking for. They’re able men, clever, but they aren’t schooled in American values.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For nine languorous, pleasant days Congressman Clyde V. Carter of Texas got the standard Fort treatment, not knowing that every incident in his entertainment was leading up to the two climactic experiences reserved for visiting dignitaries. On the morning of the last day Hoxworth Hale observed brightly: “Congressman, we’ve been monopolizing you for more than a week, and you haven’t really seen the islands for yourself. So we’ve arranged to drop out of the picture today. We’ve got a tour car for you, and we want you to go exploring.” A long black car was waiting in the driveway, and Hoxworth introduced the driver. “This is Tom Kahuikahela, and he knows more about Hawaii than anyone you’ve met so far. Tom, this is a very important visitor, Congressman Carter. Take mighty good care of him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, as Carter climbed out of the car to enjoy the glorious Pali, he found Tom Kahuikahela at his elbow, whispering, “It’s to men like you, Congressman, that all of us look for the salvation of Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t give us statehood, Congressman. Please.” The robust Hawaiian begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought everybody was for statehood,” Carter gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no! The Hawaiians tremble for fear you’ll give us statehood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The day we become a state, the Japanese will capture the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For the rest of that day an appalled Congressman Carter listened as his driver told him the truth about Hawaii: how the local Japanese had plotted to destroy Pearl Harbor; how they were trying to marry all the Hawaiian girls so as to destroy the race; how they craftily bought all the land; how they controlled the stores and refused to extend credit to Hawaiians; how the young Japanese lawyers were planning to steal control of the islands; how truly desperate things were. “The only thing that saves us, sir, are the appointed governor and the judges.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Several times Carter interrupted. “I thought it was the Chinese who owned the land,” he suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They buy it only for the sly Japanese,” the driver assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It looked to me as if Black Jim McLafferty was the head of the Democratic Party here, but you say the Japanese . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re using him for a front man . . . just for a while . . . then they take over.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But why doesn’t a man like Hoxworth Hale . . . Now surely, he must know everything you’ve told me. Why hasn’t he told me these things?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s scared to,” the driver whispered ominously. “Everybody’s scared of what’s happening, and that’s why we have to depend on good men like you to save us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do all Hawaiians feel this way?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Every one,” Tom Kahuikahela replied. “We dread statehood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Congressman Carter had not stayed on top of Texas politics for twenty-four years by being a fool, and he knew that you often found out what a man was really talking about only when he was done with his main pitch and had relaxed. Then you could sometimes slip in a fast question and dislodge the truth, so that it came tumbling out, and now Carter probed: “Just what kind of government would you like to see in the islands, Tom?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well I’ll tell you, sir!” the big man replied, adding a dimension beyond what his employers, Janders and Hale, had paid for. “What I’m working for is the return of the monarchy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did you have in mind?” Carter asked in a confidential manner.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, I’d like to see a king back on the throne, with a Hawaiian senate and the old nobles sort of running things. The big laws could be made in Washington, because we don’t really need a legislature with a lot of lawyers arguing all the time. And the king would give big parties and the palace would be restored.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where would the United States come in?” Carter asked, and to his surprise Tom had a good answer.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, like I said, we’d want you to pass the big laws, and coin our money for us, and you’d control all of our foreign policy. Our secretary of state would be appointed by your President, with approval of your Senate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You say my President. Isn’t he yours, too?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To tell the truth, sir, he isn’t. My family boycotted the annexation. We keep a Hawaiian flag at home. We pray for the day when the alii come back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were your family alii?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir,” Tom replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">And Carter muttered, “I think I’m beginning to understand Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The average people of the islands had a pretty shrewd idea of what occurred when congressmen were driven around Oahu, and they called this gambit “government by taxi driver,” but they respected the device as the most effective lobby in Hawaii, But on this day a Democratic spy at a filling station phoned Black Jim McLafferty and reported: “They’ve got Congressman Carter going around the island today. Giving him the taxi-driver needle.”</p>

  <p class="normal">McLafferty slammed down the phone and stared at his partner. “Shig,” he confided, “they’re giving our boy the old ‘government by taxi driver’ routine. And that can hurt.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What can we do?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two tacticians studied the problem for a long time, and finally the Irishman snapped: “Shig, one way or another I’m going to get hold of our congressman. I’m going to bring him down here, and you’re going to take him home with you. Show him an average Japanese family. But, Shig, you run over there right now and see that your dad’s service flag is hanging on the wall in the front room. The one with two gold stars. And you get your mother’s box, the one with the glass cover and all the medals, and you see that every goddamned medal is polished and lying flat so our boy can read them. Now get going, and be back here, waiting, in half an hour. Because I’m coming back with Congressman Carter, dead or alive.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in this way that Congressman Clyde V. Carter, of Texas, became one of the few Democrats ever to meet a Democratic family during a visit to Hawaii. Black Jim spotted the tour car returning to Honolulu along Nimitz Highway, and he elbowed it over to the shoulder, explaining, “Congressman, I’ve just got a damned interesting cable from Democratic Headquarters in Washington. I thought you ought to advise me as to how I should answer it.” McLafferty had peeled off the date line, trusting that Carter would fail to notice this, and his luck held, so while Carter was reading the complex message, Black Jim politely eased him out of the taxi and into the old Pontiac. “We’d better answer it at the office,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Carter entered the door of McLafferty and Sakagawa, there stood Shigeo waiting, and the young man said bluntly, “While Mr. McLafferty’s answering the cable, I thought you might like to see a Japanese home. Just an average place.” And although this was the last wish in Carter’s mind, he could find no graceful escape, and a few minutes later he was being hauled into the Sakagawa cottage. “This whole thing’s a transparent trick,” he decided.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the front door he met old and bent Mrs. Sakagawa, who knew little English and who wore funny Japanese sandals with things between the toes. Shig did the interpreting and said, “Mom, this is a famous United States congressman.” Mrs. Sakagawa sucked in her breath audibly, and bowed. “And this,” Shig said proudly, “is my bow-legged, tough-minded little father, Kamejiro Sakagawa.” The old man sucked in his breath and bowed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he an American citizen?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not allowed become citizen,” Kamejiro said belligerently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s right,” Shigeo explained. “I am, because I was born here. But people like my father and mother, they were born in Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And they can’t become citizens?” Carter asked in surprise. “Mexicans can.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Little Kamejiro stuck out his jaw and wagged his finger at the congressman: “Mexicans okay. Colored people okay. Anybody okay but not Japanese. How do you like dat?</p>

  <p class="normal">Congressman Carter, looking away from the argumentative little man, saw the service flag, with two blue stars and two gold. As a professional politician he automatically grew reverent and asked quietly, “Were you in service, Mr. --” He couldn’t recall the name.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I and my three brothers,” Shig said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And two gave their lives for America?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">In Japanese Shigeo asked, “Mom, where’s that picture of the four of us in football uniforms?” His mother, who prized this picture above all others, found it and jabbed it into Carter’s hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This one is Tadao,” Shigeo said of the fleet young halfback. “He died in Italy. This one is Minoru,” he added. “He died in France. This is my brother Goro, a labor-union man . . .” And the spell was broken. That was all Congressman Carter required to hear, and he drew away from the picture of four average American boys. He had voted against the Norris-La Guardia Act and all of its successors, and he felt that to be a labor-union man was worse, in many respects, than being a Russian communist, because the Russians, God forgive them, didn’t know any better, whereas a decent, Godfearing American who . . . The speech was running in his mind, and Shigeo knew it. The two men drew apart.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, by one of those lucky flukes that save some meetings and wreck others, Mrs. Sakagawa thrust into the congressman’s hand her glass box of medals, and in Japanese said, “These are Minoru’s. These are Tadao’s. These are Goro’s. And these five are Shigeo’s.” As she said the latter, she patted her son on his arm, and communion was re-established.</p>

  <p class="normal">Carter studied the medals and said, “Your family accomplished a great deal.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Congressman,” Shig began quietly, “each of us boys had to fight his way to get into uniform. We had to be better soldiers than anyone else in the world.” He felt words coming into his mouth that he would be ashamed of later, but he could no longer hold them back. “We performed as perhaps no other family of boys did in the last war. We accumulated wounds and glory, and by God, sir, when you refused to shake my hand the other day I almost wept. Because whether you know it or not, Congressman, I’m one of your constituents, and by God I will never again accept such treatment from you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Constituent?” Carter gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir. Congressman, have you heard of the Lost Battalion?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Carter had not only heard of it, he had orated about it; and in relief the words came back to him: “It was one of the high water marks of Texas bravery, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many of your men died there, Congressman?” Shigeo pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Too many,” Carter replied sorrowfully. “The scars upon Texas are great.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know why any escaped?” There was a pause, and Shig asked harshly, “Well, do you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I supposed that the gallant fighters of Texas . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Horse manure!” Shig snapped. “Your men of Texas live today, sir, because my dead brother Minoru, one of the finest men who ever touched earth, and Goro and I led a gang of Japanese boys to their rescue. We lost eight hundred men, rescuing three hundred Texans!” He cried bitterly, “I want you to read this.” And from his wallet he produced a treasured card, and Carter took it and read it, and he saw that it had been signed by a friend of his, a governor of Texas, and it stated that in gratitude for heroism beyond the call of duty, Shigeo Sakagawa was forever an honorary citizen, of the State of Texas. Said the card: “On our day of desperate need, you succored us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Gravely Carter handed back the card, but as he did so, he kept his hand extended, saying, “In all humility, Mr. Sakagawa, I should like to shake your hand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I should like to shake yours,” Shig said, and the moment could have been extremely fruitful for Hawaii statehood, except that Mr. Ishii chose this instant to break into his father-in-law’s house with momentous news.</p>

  <p class="normal">The skinny little man with eyes like bowls of frightened tapioca saw the tall stranger, hesitated and started to back out, but his wife Reiko-chan blocked the doorway, and Carter, always careful to catch the eye of a pretty girl, bowed in a courtly manner and said, “Have you come with your father?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is my husband,” Reiko-chan said in perfect English.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is a congressman, from Texas!” Shig announced proudly, and at this news Reiko-chan, who knew what her husband was up to, tried to edge him out of the house, but he had heard the word congressman, and now asked with compassion, “You come to arrange the surrender?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What surrender?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">In desperate embarrassment, Reiko-chan tugged at Mr. Ishii’s sleeve, but she could not silence him. “The surrender of Hawaii to Japan,” Mr. Ishii explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How’s that?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“See what the paper says!” Mr. Ishii cried joyously, flashing the Honolulu Mail, which headlined: “Japanese Fleet to Make Courtesy Visit to Islands.” When the paper had passed from hand to hand the excited little man cackled, “Long time, sir, I tell them, ‘Japan won the war.’ But nobody listen, so I ask you. ‘If Japan lose, how their fleet come to Hawaii?’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he saying what I think he’s saying?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is a poor old man,” Reiko-chan said softly. “Don’t listen to him, Congressman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But now Mr. Ishii produced a worn photograph of the Japanese surrendering on board the Missouri. “You can see who won,” he explained. “The Americans had to go to Tokyo. And see how all the American admirals are without neckties, while the Japanese have their swords. Of course Japan won.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And what will happen when your fleet gets here?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Japanese very honorable men, sir. You see tonight when they come ashore. They behave good.” He went to the door, threw it open and pointed down to the blue waters of the Pacific, where a squadron of five warships steamed under the bold red flag of the new Japan. Mr. Ishii’s heart expanded, and he forgave his wife for her years of arguing against him. From his coat he whipped out a Japanese flag, long hidden, and waved encouragement to the conquerors as they came to take control of Pearl Harbor.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I guess we’d better be going,” Carter said. “I have to catch the plane.” But as he was not fooled by crazy old Mr. Ishii; he knew that in the Sakagawas, as he called them, he had seen a tremendous American family, and he was impressed, so that when he got Mc-Lafferty’s message that the Hales would pick him up at the corner of Fort and Hotel on the way to the airport, he said, “I’d just like to stand outside and watch the people for a few minutes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as he stood there in the late afternoon, in the heart of Honolulu, watching the varied people of the island go past, he had a faint glimmer of the ultimate brotherhood in which the world must one day live: Koreans went by in amity with Japanese whom in. their homeland they hated, while Japanese accepted Chinese, and Filipinos accepted both, a thing unheard of in the Philippines. A Negro passed by, and many handsome Hawaiians whose blood was mixed with that of China or Portugal or Puerto Rico. It was a strange, new breed of men Congressmen Carter saw, and grudgingly an idea came to him: “Maybe they’ve got something. Maybe I wasted my time here in Hawaii, living in the big houses of the white people. Maybe this is the pattern of the future. That Japanese boy today, he’s as good . . . Look at that couple. I wonder who they are. I wonder if they would mind . . .” But before he could speak to them, a long black car driven not by a chauffeur but Hewlett Janders drove up, and Hoxworth Hale jumped out to whisk the congressman back into reality. Icy John Whipple Hoxworth shared the front seat, and as the car slowly crept away from the turmoil of Hotel Street, the three senior citizens of Hawaii provided their guest with the second climax of any official visit to the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Coldly, and with no inflection in his voice, Hoxworth Hale laid it on the line. He spoke rapidly and looked the congressman right in the eye. “Carter,” he said, “you’ve seen the islands, and you’ve heard each man in this car make public speeches in favor of statehood. Now we’ve got to get down to cases. If you’re insane enough to give us statehood, you’ll wreck Hawaii and do irreparable damage to the United States. Save us from ourselves, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Carter gasped. “Is that your honest opinion, Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s the opinion of almost every person you met in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But why don’t you . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re afraid to. Reprisals … I don’t know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Give me the facts straight,” Carter said. “What’s wrong with statehood?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is in confidence?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You understand,” Janders threw back over his shoulder, “that if you were to betray us, we’d suffer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand,” Carter said. “That’s often the case in governing a democracy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Here are the facts,” Hale said simply. “The white man in Hawaii is being submerged. He has some financial power left, a good deal, I suppose. He has the courts to defend him, and an appointed governor upon whom he can rely. Sir, if you change any one of those factors, Hawaii will become a toy in the hands of Japanese. They’ll control the courts and start bringing in decisions against us. They’ll upset our system of land holding. They’ll elect their own governor and send Japanese to Congress. Do you want to serve with a Jap?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long silence in the car, and more in the way of eliciting further information than in disclosing his own conclusions Carter replied, “This afternoon I met a Japanese, a young man! named Shig Sakagawa, and for a while I thought that maybe . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders spoke. “Did he tell you that his brother, Goro, was the leading communist in Hawaii? A proved, card-carrying, subversive, filthy communist. That’s the brother of the man who’s running for senator from this district. That’s a picture of Hawaii under Japanese rule.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I must admit,” Carter said, “that nobody told me about this brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The leader of the communist movement in Hawaii,” Janders reiterated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Carter was somewhat shaken to think how nearly he had been taken in by the plausible young Japanese lawyer, so he decided to check additional items of information. “By the way,” he asked casually, “what’s the sentiment out here for a return of monarchy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Up front Hewie Janders and John Whipple Hoxworth stared at each other in amazement and muttered, “Monarchy?” while in the back Hoxworth Hale gasped. Then he said forcefully, “Congressman . . .” but Hewie was now recovered and blurted out, “Jesus Christ, nobody in his right mind pays any attention to those monarchy crackpots.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What were you about to say, Hale?” Carter pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As you may know, I’m descended from the royal alii of Hawaii, and my great-great-great-grandmother was one of the noblest women I’ve ever heard of. Her daughter was quite a girl, too. Magnificent. But if one of those pathetic, incompetent alii ever tried to get back on the throne of Hawaii, I personally would take down my musket and shoot him through the head.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d do it first,” Hewie Janders interrupted. “You know, sir, that Hale’s great-grandfather brought Hawaii into the Union?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He did?” Carter asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Hale said simply. “Practically by force of his own character. But I’d like to add this, sir. I’m also descended from the missionaries. And if one of them tried to come back and govern in. the harsh, bigoted old way, I’d shoot him through the head, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let me get it straight then, what is it you want?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t want royalty, we don’t want missionaries, and we don’t want Japanese,” Hale summarized. “We want things to go along just as they are.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a very somber carload of men that finally pulled up at the airport, and Black Jim McLafferty, as he watched them disembark, thought: “I’ll bet they’ve been pumping that one with a load of poison.” He started to join the congressman, but when Carter saw him coming, he retreated to the safety of Hewlett Janders, for he did not want to be photographed with a man, even though he was leader of the Democratic Party, who had as his partner a Japanese whose brother headed the Communist Party in the islands. “In fact,” he mused as he checked his tickets, “Hawaii’s a lot like most parts of the north. You can travel from state to state and never find a Democrat you really like. They’re all either tarred with labor or communism or atheism or Catholicism. I’ll be glad to get back to Texas.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as he climbed aboard the Stratoclipper and sank into his comfortable seat he thought: “Basically, it’s the same everywhere. A handful of substantial honest men govern and try to hold back the mobs. If you can get along with those men, you can usually find out what the facts of the case are.” He stared out the window glumly as Japanese airport mechanics wheeled away the steps while other Japanese waved wands directing the big airplane on its way. He closed his eyes and thought: “Well, I found out what I wanted. These islands won’t be ready for statehood in another hundred years.” And that took care of Hawaii for the eighty-third session of Congress.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1952, passage of the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act was greeted with joy in Hawaii, for the new law permitted persons born in the Orient to become American citizens. Schools were promptly opened in which elderly Chinese and Japanese were drilled in the facts of American government, and it was not uncommon in those days to see old men who had worked all their lives as field hands reciting stubbornly: “Legislative, executive, judicial.”</p>

  <p class="normal">By early 1953 hundreds of Orientals were applying for the citizenship that had so long been denied them, and as Black Jim McLafferty watched&#160; this&#160;&#160; impressive&#160; stream&#160;&#160; of&#160; potential&#160; Democratic&#160; voters entering political life he made a speech in which he cried: “They built the islands, but they were kept outside.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It is true that many of the applicants did not really appreciate what citizenship meant, but on the other hand it was impressive to see old weather-stained faces light up when the solemn words were pronounced by the federal judge: “You are now a citizen of the United States of America.” And it was not uncommon to see a sedate businessman suddenly grab his old Japanese mother and swing her into the air with a joyous cry of, “I knew you could make it, Mom!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The real heroes of these exciting days were the old people who had refused to learn English, but who now had to learn or forgo American citizenship. Their children screamed at them: “Pop, I told you for twenty years, learn to speak English. But no, you were too smart!, Now you can’t become a citizen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But why should I become a citizen now?” these old people asked. “Only a few more years.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Often the children broke into tears and sniffled: “You must learn English, Pop, because I have always wanted you to be an American.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For me it is nothing,” the old people said, “but if it will make you happy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will, Pop! It’ll remove the last stigma. Please learn English.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With a fortitude that is difficult to believe, these stubborn old Orientals went to the language schools. All afternoon they practiced: “I see the man,” and most of the night they recited: “Legislative, executive, judicial.” That so many mastered the two difficult subjects was a credit to their persistence, and when they finally received certificates they understood their value. In succeeding years, at mainland elections only about sixty per cent of the eligible voters bothered to vote; in Hawaii more than ninety per cent voted. They knew what democracy was.</p>

  <p class="normal">In two Honolulu families the McCarran-Walter Act struck with contrasting effect. When Goro and Shigeo Sakagawa proposed to their tough old father that he enroll in the English school and get a book which explained the legislative, executive and judicial functions he surprised them by saying in unusually formal Japanese, “I do not wish to become a citizen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro protested: “It’s the opportunity of a lifetime!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Continuing with his precise Japanese, Kamejiro said, “They should have made this offer fifty years ago, when I arrived.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Pop!” Shigeo reasoned. “It’s a new world today. Don’t hark back to fifty years ago.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For fifty years we were told, “You dirty Japs can never become Americans.’ For fifty years we were told, ‘Go back to Japan.’ Now they come to me and say, ‘You’re a fine old man, Kamejiro, and at last we are willing to let you become an American.’ Do you know what I say to them? ‘You are fifty years too late.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">His sons were astonished to discover the depth of their father’s feeling, so they turned to their mother and endeavored to persuade her, but before she could react to their pressures, old Kamejiro said flatly, “Yoriko, you will not take the examination. All our lives we were good citizens and we don’t need a piece of paper to prove it now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Shigeo produced two reasons which threw quite a different light on the matter. First he said, “Pop, last time I almost lost the election because people brought up that nonsense about Mr. Ishii and his crazy Japanese flag when the fleet visited here. They pointed out that he was my brother-in-law and that I probably felt the same way too. Now if you turn down citizenship they’re going to shout, ‘That proves it! The whole damned family is pro-Japanese!’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">Old Kamejiro reflected on this, and Shig could see that his father was disturbed, for none of the old Japanese had been more delighted during the last election than Kamejiro. He had stood for hours in his store, staring at the big poster of his son. “There our boy was,” he proudly told his wife, “asking people to vote for him.” When Shig won, the old man had paraded up and down Kakaako announcing the fact to all Japanese families, assuring them that at last they had a personal protector in Iolani Palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">While Kamejiro twisted this first bait about in his mouth, Shig dangled another, more tempting than the first: “Pop, if you and Mom become citizens, in 1954 you can march up to the election booth, say, ‘Give us our ballots,’ and march inside to give me two more votes.” Now Shig could see his father imagining election day, with himself striding to the polls, his wife trailing four feet behind. The old man loved nothing more than the panoply and ritual of life, and Shig could remember from his earliest days the pride with which his father dressed in Colonel Ito’s uniform to stand beside the reciter. This had been the highlight of Kamejiro’s life, matched only by the days in World War II when he saw his four sons march off to their own war. Therefore Shig was not prepared for what happened next.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will not take citizenship,” the old man said resolutely. “If this hurts you, Shigeo, I am sorry. If my vote and Mother’s cause you to lose the election, I am sorry. But there is a right time to eat a pineapple, and if that time passes, the pineapple is bitter in the mouth. For fifty years I have been one of the best citizens in Hawaii. No boys in trouble. No back taxes. So for America to tell me now that I can have citizenship, at the end of my life, is insulting. America can go to hell.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He would not discuss the question again. Once Shig and Goro approached him with the news that Immigration had a new rule: “People who have lived in the islands for a long time don’t have to take their examinations in English. What that means, Pop, is that you and Mom can now become citizens without bothering with the language school.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It would be insulting,” Kamejiro said, and the boys withdrew.</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig talked the problem over with McLafferty, and his partner said, “Hell, your old man’s right. It’s as if they had told our people in Massachusetts, ‘We kicked you Catholics around for two generations. Now you can all become Protestants and run for office.’ Like he says, it would have been insulting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think there’s any analogy,” Shig said coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Probably you’re right,” the Irishman agreed. “But it sounds good if the other guy doesn’t listen too dose.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This may hurt me in the next election,” Shig said carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">McLafferty boomed: “Shig, if your old man hadn’t always been the way he is now, you wouldn’t be the kind of guy you are. And if you weren’t that kind of person, I wouldn’t want you for a partner. What he’s given you, nobody can take away.” .</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, but he’s become so provoked about this he says he’s going back to Japan to live.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He won’t like it,” McLafferty predicted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wouldn’t that hurt me in the election?” Shig pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My father found,” McLafferty said, “that just a little scandal helped rather than hurt. It made the electorate feel that the candidate was human. That’s why I warned you about never disclosing in a lawsuit that a witness kept a mistress. For sure, somebody on the jury has either had a mistress--or if she’s a woman, has been one-- and your evidence is bound to backfire, because the juror says, ‘Hell, I had a mistress, and I’m no scoundrel.’ So if your old man acts up, Shig, it won’t hurt you . . . not with the people whose votes we want . . . because their old folks act up too.” And that was the end of Kamejiro Sakagawa’s citizenship.</p>

  <p class="normal">With Nyuk Tsin the case was quite-different. From the day she had landed in Honolulu eighty-eight years before, she had forsworn forever the starving villages of China and had determined to become a permanent resident of Hawaii. When the United States annexed the islands, she desperately sought American citizenship, but to no avail. From her frail body had descended some seven hundred American citizens, and not one had so far been in jail. In a lockbox she still kept her tax receipts covering nearly a century, and when she heard that there was a chance that she might become an American citizen, truly and without limitation, she felt that she could know no greater joy.</p>

  <p class="normal">She therefore had her Harvard-trained great-grandson, Eddie Kee, study the new law and heckle the Immigration authorities until she understood every nuance. When the first language class convened, she was present, and although she was well over a hundred years old at the time, she drove her eager brain to its extent, and in the evenings sat listening to the English-language radio. But she was so ingrained in Chinese thought that English escaped her, and one night she faced up to her failure. She told Hong Kong, “I can’t learn the language now. Why didn’t somebody force me to learn it years ago? Now I shall never become a citizen.” And she looked disconsolately at her grandson.</p>

  <p class="normal">But then Eddie arrived with the exciting news that certain elderly Orientals would be allowed to take the examinations in their own tongue, provided they were literate in it, and at this news Nyuk Tsin covered her old eyes for a moment, then looked up brightly and said, “I shall learn to write.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong therefore hired a learned Chinese to teach the old woman what was undoubtedly the most difficult language in the world, but after a while it became apparent that she was simply too old to learn, so Eddie went to the Immigration authorities and said honestly, “My great-grandmother is a hundred and six, and she wants more than anything else in the world to become an American citizen. But she can’t speak English . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No trouble!” the examiner explained. “Now she can be examined in Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But she can’t read and write Chinese,” Eddie continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well!” The examiner studied this for a while, then went into the back office, and in a moment Mr. Brimstead, an official from Washington, appeared with one question: “You say this old woman is a hundred and six?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She got a family?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Probably the biggest in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good! We’ve been looking for something dramatic. Pictures we could use for publicity in Asia. You get the family together. I’ll give her the exam myself and we’ll waive the literacy. But wait a minute. Is she able to answers questions. I mean, is she competent?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Auntie is competent,” her great-grandson assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because on the questions I can’t fudge. You know: legislative, executive, judicial.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can I accompany her, to give her moral support?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure, but our interpreters will report her answers, and they have to be right.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She will be right,” the young lawyer guaranteed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He therefore entered upon a long series of cramming sessions with his great-grandmother, teaching her in the Hakka tongue the many intricacies of American government, and this time, with citizenship hanging like a silver lichee nut before her, she summoned her remarkable energies and memorized the entire booklet.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The father of our country?” Eddie shouted at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“George Washington.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who freed the slaves?” Hong Kong drilled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abraham Lincoln,” the little old woman replied, and Eddie reflected: “It’s difficult to believe, but she came to Hawaii in the year that Lincoln died.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the day of her examination, the Immigration Department assembled several newsreel cameras, officials in white coats, and about two hundred members of the Kee hui, who were told to cheer when the old lady arrived in Hong Kong’s Buick. When she stepped down, brushing aside Eddie’s arm, she was very short, weighed less than ninety pounds, and was dressed in an old-style black Chinese dress above which her nearly bald head rose with its deep-set eyes, legendary wrinkles and anxious smile. She did not speak to her accumulated family, for she was repeating in her mind many litanies alien to ancient China: “The capital of Alabama is Montgomery; Arizona, Phoenix; Arkansas, Little Rock; California, Sacramento.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The cameras were moved into the examination room, and an announcer said in a hushed voice, “We are now going to listen in upon a scene that is taking place daily throughout the United States. A distinguished elderly Chinese woman, Mrs. Kee, after nearly ninety years of life in America, is going to try to pass her examination for citizenship. Mrs. Kee, good luck!”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the mention of her name, which in that form she did not recognize, Nyuk Tsin looked at the cameras, but her great-grandson said hurriedly, “Look over here. This is the examiner, Mr. Brimstead,” and the announcer explained who the distinguished visitor from Washington was. The lights were adjusted; Nyuk Tsin began to sweat in nervous apprehension; and Mr. Brimstead, who was proving to be quite a ham on his first appearance before a camera, asked in a sweetly condescending voice, “Now tell us, Mrs. Kee, who was the father of our country?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The official interpreter shot the question at the old lady in Hakka, and both Hong Kong and Eddie smiled superiorly, because they knew that Wu Chow’s Auntie knew that one.</p>

  <p class="normal">But there was silence. The cameras ground. Mr. Brimstead looked foolish and the Hakka interpreter shrugged his shoulders. “Wu Chow’s Auntie!” Eddie whispered hoarsely. “You know. The father of our country!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now, no coaching!” Mr. Brimstead rebuked. “This has got to be an honest examination.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wasn’t coaching,” Eddie pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He didn’t say nothing,” the interpreter said in English.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right!” Mr. Brimstead snapped. “No coaching. Now, Mrs. Kee,” and his voice was all honey again, “who was the father of our country?” And again the interpreter droned in Hakka and again there was silence. In agony Hong Kong stared at his grandmother and opened and shut his fingers by his mouth, signifying, “For God’s sake, say something.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the scene was too vital for old Nyuk Tsin to absorb. All her life she had wanted to belong: first to her brave and gallant father, whose head had perched in the village square; then to her Punti husband, who had scorned her big feet; then to her children, who were afraid of her possible leprosy; then to America, which had repulsed her as it did all Orientals. Now, when all that she hoped for was attainable, she fell mute. She heard no questions, saw no men, felt nothing. But she sensed inwardly that some golden moment, some crystal opportunity that would never come again was slipping by, and she looked up with mute anguish at the people about her.</p>

  <p class="normal">She saw kindly Mr. Brimstead, almost wetting his pants in his eagerness for her to say something so that he could appear in the moving pictures. She saw bright young Eddie, who had coached her. She saw resolute Hong Kong, who must be praying for her to save the family reputation. And then over Hong Kong’s shoulder she saw an official government etching of a long-dead hero with a determined chin and a three-cornered hat, and she heard as from a great distance the Hakka interpreter begging for the last time, “Mrs. Kee, tell the man, who was the founder of our country?” And with the floodgates of passion breaking over her, she rose, pointed at the etching of George Washington, and screamed, “That one!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then she started: “The capital of Alabama is Montgomery; Arizona, Phoenix; Arkansas, Little Rock; California, Sacramento . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell her that’s enough!” Mr. Brimstead shouted. “I didn’t ask that question yet.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Keep those cameras grinding,” the director shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You!” Hong Kong shouted at the interpreter. “Keep interpreting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The legislative passes the laws,” Nyuk Tsin cried, “and the executive administers them and the judicial judges them against the Constitution.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s enough!” Mr. Brimstead shouted. “Tell her it’s all right.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And the Bill of Rights says that there shall be freedom of worship, and freedom of speech,” Nyuk Tsin continued. “And no troops may search my house. And I may not be punished in cruel ways.” She was determined to omit nothing that might swing the decision in her favor. “There are two houses in Congress,” she insisted, “the Senate and the House . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">When she left the Immigration building, with her citizenship proved and in her hand, the Kees who had been waiting outside cheered, and she passed happily among them, speaking to each and asking, “What is your name?” and when they told her, she was able to place each one. And as she ticked off her great family she realized for the first time that they were neither Hakka nor Punti, for in Hawaii those old enmities had dissipated and all who had arrived in the Carthaginian had been transmuted into something new. In truth, the Kees were not even Chinese; they were Americans, and now Nyuk Tsin was an American too. Standing by Hong Kong’s car she whispered, “When you are a citizen, the earth feels different.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But these fine words did not erase from Hong Kong’s memory the anxiety he had suffered when in the examination room his auntie had sat in stolid silence like a Chinese peasant and now when he looked down at her citizenship paper, his former irritation returned and he protested with some petulance: “Oh, Wu Chow’s Auntie! You didn’t even pick up the right paper.” He took the document from her and showed her where the strange name was written: Char Nyuk Tsin. But when he had read this name aloud to her, she said quietly and yet with great stubbornness, “I told the helpful man, ‘Now that I am an American you must write on this paper my real name.’” And she climbed purposefully into the car, a small old woman who had made a great journey.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night, terribly tired from the ordeal of citizenship, she lit her oil lamp, undressed, and inspected herself for leprosy. There were no lumps on her arms; her fingers were still good; her face was not deformed; and her legs were clean. Greatly relieved, she put the lamp on the floor so that she could examine her big feet, and in the morning Hong Kong found her there, a frail, naked, old dead body of bones, beside a sputtering lamp.</p>

  <p class="normal">As <span>THOUSANDS</span> of once-proscribed Orientals gained citizenship and the vote, and as labor attained fresh power, haoles gloomily predicted that their day in Hawaii was ended, and no one felt this more strongly than Hoxworth Hale, for he was passing through a period of mist and fog, and his bearings were insecure: he was unable to understand his mercurial daughter or to communicate with his elfin-minded wife, who flitted from one inconsequential subject to the next. He tried diligently to maintain control of both H &amp; H and of Hawaii, but he suspected that each was slipping away from him. Finally, the great pineapple crisis of 1953 struck and it looked as if Hawaii itself were crumbling.</p>

  <p class="normal">The disaster first became known when a luna on Kauai inspected one of the far fields and discovered that all the plants which should have been a rich bluish green were now a sickly yellow. He immediately thought: “Some damn fool forgot to spray for nematodes.” But when he consulted the records, he found that the field had been sprayed to control the tiny worms, so one of the pineapple botanists employed by The Fort flew over to inspect the dying plants and said, “This isn’t nematodes. As a matter of fact, I don’t know what it is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the second week of the blight, the once-sturdy plants fell over on their sides, as if some interior enemy had sapped their vitality, but there were no scars, no boring insects, nothing. The botanist became frightened and phoned Honolulu to discover that plants on scattered fields throughout the islands were beginning to show similar symptoms.</p>

  <p class="normal">It would be an understatement to say that panic struck the pineapple industry. A raging fear swept the red fields and echoed in the Fort Street offices. Hoxworth Hale bore the brunt of the anxiety, because H &amp; H had a good deal of its wealth in pineapples, while outfits like Hewlett’s and J &amp; W, who looked to him for leadership, were even more vulnerable. The loss in one year alone threatened to exceed $150,000,000, and still the botanists had no due as to what was happening to their precious charges.</p>

  <p class="normal">The famous Englishman, Schilling, who had licked mealy-bugs and nematodes, was now dead, but research scholars went through his papers to see if he had left any clues as to further apprehensions. But that was only a figure of speech, for the drunken expert had left no orderly papers and no suggestions. He had died one night in a fit of delirium tremens in a poverty ward on the island of Kauai, the nurses not recognizing who he was until after his death. Nevertheless, the botanists repeated all of Schilling’s work on the pineapple and assured themselves that the fault lay not with iron, nor bugs, nor nematodes. They discovered nothing about the current disease except that hundreds of thousands of plants seemed determined to die.</p>

  <p class="normal">In desperation, Hoxworth Hale suggested: “We know we’re being attacked either by some invisible virus or by some chemical deficiency. It doesn’t seem to be the former. Therefore, it’s got to be the latter. I am willing to spray-feed every plant in the islands. But what with?”</p>

  <p class="normal">A young chemist from Yale suggested: “We know the complete chemical component of the pineapple plant. Let’s mix a spray which contains everything that might possibly be lacking. We’ll shoot blind. At the same time, you fellows compare by analysis a hundred dead plants with a hundred unaffected ones. Maybe you can spot the deficiency.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young man mixed a fantastic brew, a little of everything, and sprayed one of the dying fields. Almost as if by magic the hungry plants absorbed some tiny, unspecified element in the concoction, and within two days were both upright and back to proper color. It was one of the most dramatic recoveries in the history of pineapple culture, and that night for the first time in several months Hoxworth Hale slept peacefully. In the morning his board asked him, “What was it that saved the crop?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nobody knows. Now we’re going to find out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He encouraged the scientists, who withheld from the magic brew one component after another, but the fields responded dramatically no matter what was sprayed on them; and then one day zinc was omitted, and that day the plants continued to die.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Zinc!” Hale shouted. “Who the hell ever heard of adding zinc to pineapple soils?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nobody had, but over the years the constant leaching of the soil and the introduction of chemical fertilizers had minutely depleted the zinc, whose presence to begin with no one was aware of, and when the critical moment was reached, the zinc-starved plants collapsed. “What other chemicals may be approaching the danger line?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t know,” the scientists replied, but prudence warned him that if zinc had imperceptibly fled from the fields, other trace minerals must be doing so too, and he launched what became perhaps the most sophisticated development in the entire history of agriculture: “We are going to consider our famous red soil of Hawaii as a bank. From it we draw enormous supplies of things like calcium and nitrate and iron, and those are easy to replace. But we also seem to draw constant if minute supplies of things like zinc, and we haven’t been putting them back. Starting today, I want the chemical components of every scrap of material harvested from our pineapple fields analyzed and their total weight calculated. If we take out a ton of nitrate, we’ll put a ton back. And if we withdraw one-millionth of a gram of zinc, we’re going to put the same amount back. This marvelous soil is our bank. Never again will we overdraw our account.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was strange what depletions the scientists found: zinc, titanium, boron, cobalt, and many others. They were present in the soil only in traces, but if one vanished, the pineapple plants perished; and one night when balance had been restored to the vast plantations, and the economy of Hawaii saved, Hoxworth Hale, who had refused to surrender either to nematodes or to the depletion of trace minerals, suddenly had a vision of Hawaii as a great pineapple field: no man could say out of hand what contributions the Filipino or the Korean or the Norwegian had made, but if anyone stole from Hawaii those things which the tiniest component added to the society, perhaps the human pineapples would begin to perish, too. For a long time Hale stood at the edge of his fields, contemplating this new concept, and after that he viewed people like Filipinos and Portuguese in an entirely different light. “What vital thing do they add that keeps our society healthy?” he often wondered.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Hong Kong Kee had served on various boards of The Fort for a testing period the unbelievable happened. He was summoned to the chambers of Judge Harper, who had married one of the Hoxworth girls, and was advised by that careful Texan: “Hong Kong, the judges have decided to appoint you one of the trustees of the Malama Kanakoa Estate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong stepped back as if the good judge had belted him across the face with a raw whip. “You mean that without applying, I’ve been appointed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. We felt that with Hawaii’s commerce and politics falling more and more into the hands of our Oriental brothers, certain steps ought to be taken to recognize that fact.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In spite of his cynical knowledge of how The Fort and its ramifications operated, Hong Kong was visibly moved by the appointment, for he knew that when the evening papers revealed this story the extent of the Hawaii revolution could no longer be ignored. With bright young Japanese politicians taking over the legislature, the only remaining bulwark of the old order was the great trusteeships, and for The Fort voluntarily to relinquish one was an event of magnitude. Hong Kong was therefore inspired to complete frankness, for he wanted to be sure that Judge Harper knew what he was doing.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am deeply touched by this gesture, Judge Harper,” he said with real humility. “I guess you know what it means to be the first Chinese on such a board. You judges are giving me an accolade I’ll never forget. But do you know how I stand on land tenure? Leasehold? Breaking up the big estates that don’t use their land creatively? You understand all those things, Judge?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Big Judge Harper laughed and pointed to a paper on his desk. “Hong Kong, you apparently forget who your brother trustees will be. Hewlett Janders and John Whipple Hoxworth. You think they’re going to let you run wild with any crazy idea?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But even with such men, Judge, ideas repeated often enough sometimes catch on … where you least expect them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We judges think you’re the kind of man who will bring good new ideas, but we certainly aren’t going to back you against your two fellow trustees.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not looking for a fight, Judge.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We know. That’s why we’ve appointed you. But before you take the job, Hong Kong—and I appreciate even better than you how signal an honor this is, because we have been petitioned for years to appoint some Oriental—I want you to understand with crystal clarity the nature of the task you’re undertaking.” The big man adjusted his considerable bulk in his judge’s chair and told his secretary he didn’t want to be interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The very existence of Hawaii, Hong Kong, depends not upon what cynical outsiders like to term The Fort. The outsiders are wrong. It’s not The Fort that controls Hawaii. It’s the sanctity of the great trusts. They form the solid backbone of our society. The Fort is only the ribs and the people are the flesh. But the backbone has to be kept strong, and it is up to us judges to be its guardians.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The trusts control the land and establish the systems of tenure. They control the sugar and the pineapple fields. They continue, where companies rise and fall. They remain productive while the families who profit from them subside into decay. Look at the one you’re entering. It controls millions of dollars in the vital heart of Hawaii, for whom? For a dear old Hawaiian lady and her no-good beachboy son. We judges don’t spend our time worrying about that trust because we’re interested in those two poor Hawaiians. They aren’t worth it. But the idea that Malama Kanakoa and her son Kelly are assured of a square deal from the courts is terribly important.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I have to say next, Hong Kong, I don’t want to say sitting down.” The big man rose, adjusted his dark brown suit, and pointed directly at his Chinese visitor. “In the history of our great trusts, there has never been a scandal because some trustee stole money. There have been no defalcations, no illegal conversions, no overtrading for personal commissions, no theft. The trustees have often been accused of being too conservative, but in a trustee that’s not a weakness. It’s a virtue. Hong Kong, so long as we were satisfied to choose our trustees from the missionary families we enjoyed a spotlessly clean record. We’re now branching out, and in a sense we’re taking a risk. If you make one error, I personally will hound you out of the islands. The courts will never rest till you’re behind bars. If you want to do one thing which will set the Orientals in Hawaii back three generations, abuse the Malama Kanakoa Trust.” He sat down, smiled at Hong Kong, and added, “Of course, if you want to prove to our entire society that Orientals are as responsible as the missionaries ever were, you have that opportunity, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong wished that his grandmother were alive to guide him at this moment, but he felt that she would have counseled courage, so he said bluntly, “What will you judges say when I recommend that Malama Kanakoa go mostly into some pretty radical investments?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Judge Harper thought this one over a long time and finally said, “One of the reasons why we judges decided to appoint you to Malama’s trust is that Hoxworth Hale told us about your investing ideas. He said they ought to be looked into, that maybe they were the answer to some of these trusts with vast back-tax structures.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then Hoxworth Hale got me this job?” Hong Kong asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You misunderstand, Hong Kong, I appointed you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Chinese bowed slightly, but could not keep from smiling, and soon Judge Harper joined him. Rising from his desk and putting his arm about Hong Kong’s shoulders, he said, “Let’s put it this way. If you turn out badly, Hoxworth doesn’t suffer the opprobrium. I do. Hong Kong, you are really going to be watched. By me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do they call these Negroes who are the first to move into a white neighborhood?” Hong Kong laughed. “The blockbusters? Looks as if I’m the trustbuster.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The word has an entirely different meaning,” Judge Harper pointed out amiably, but when the able Chinese had gone he had a moment of nostalgic reflection, saying to himself, “He’s probably right. Appointing him was probably the beginning of the end … at least of the safe, comfortable, honest old system we knew.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong drove immediately home and asked the cook, “Where is Judy?” and when he found that she was teaching at the conservatory, he drove there and went in to fetch her. Since the death of Nyuk Tsin, the oldest woman of his family, he had found himself drawing markedly closer to Judy, his youngest girl. He liked women’s habits of thought, and he particularly appreciated Judy’s cool, clean reasoning.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a few minutes she joined him, a sparkling, winsome Chinese girl of twenty-six, with two braids down her back, a starched pink dress and wide, clever eyes. She bounced into the Buick and asked, “What’s up, Dad?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want you to accompany me to a very important meeting. I’ve just been appointed a trustee for the Malama Kanakoa Trust.” “Are the judges out of their minds?” Judy chortled. “The Fort has the ability to see the inevitable,” her father said. “Where are we going?” Judy asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to see Malama. I’d like to find out what her ambitions are, her hopes for the land she owns, and at the same time doesn’t own.” “Dad! You know Malama won’t have any ideas.” “That’s what everybody has said for years. But I suppose she’s as bright as you or I, and I’d like to find out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He drove toward Diamond Head until he crossed the Ala Wai canal, then turned into the gate at the board fence that surrounded the Swamp. When he drew up to the shingled house, with its spacious porch, Malama thrust open the screen door and appeared with a gigantic smile, her silver hair disheveled and her dress askew. “Hong Kong, the defender of my interests, come in! The judges told me last night!” With widespread arms she welcomed him, and Judy saw with some surprise that her father had had foresight enough to purchase a flower lei for his first visit. Graciously he bestowed it upon the woman who towered over him, then leaned up to give her two kisses while she beamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come in, my good friends!” she said expansively, adding, with the instinct that marked Hawaiians, “I never thought I should see the day when a distinguished Chinese banker was appointed one of my guardians. It is a happy day for me, Hong Kong. Your people and mine have blended well in the past, and I hope this is a good augury for the future.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s a new day in Hawaii, Malama,” he replied. “And is this your lovely daughter?” Malama asked, and when Hong Kong said that it was, she laughed and said, “In the old days I could never tell, when I saw a rich Chinese with a young girl, whether she was his daughter or his number four wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I feel the same way when I go to a night club in New York,” Hong Kong replied happily, “and see the haole bankers and their companions. We poor Chinese aren’t allowed to get away with plural marriages any longer . . . only the haoles.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want you to meet my friends,” Malama chuckled. “We gather now and then for some Hawaiian music. This is Mrs. Choy, Mrs. Fukuda, Mrs. Mendonca and Mrs. Rodriques.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong bowed to each of the huge ladies and then returned to Mrs. Choy. “You the pretty girl named after the race horse?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Mrs. Choy laughed gaily. “My name is Carry-the-Mail. You see, Father won a lot of money on that horse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know! My grandmother found out that my father had bet a lot of money on Carry-the-Mail, and she gave him hell, but the horse won. So my father and your father probably got drunk together, Mrs. Choy,” Hong Kong said easily, and the women laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is my daughter Judy, the musician. She has a job at the conservatory.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How wonderful!” Malama cried, shoving a ukulele at the lovely Chinese girl, who slipped easily and without embarrassment into the great frieze of Hawaiian ladies who lined the wall of the chandeliered room. “You won’t know the words, but you can hum.” And the six women began an old Hawaiian song from the days when royalty lived at Lahaina, on Maui. It was true that Judy Kee knew none of the words, but she harmonized well, and once the others stopped singing while she vocalized a verse, and Mrs. Choy cried, “If we could do something about those slant-eyes, we could make her into a good Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The crowd laughed and Hong Kong asked easily, “What I’d like to find out, Malama, is what are the opinions of a Hawaiian who is placed on a spendthrift trust?” It was like asking the Pope his impressions of Martin Luther, but Hong Kong’s blunt approach often proved best, and this was an occasion when it did, for all the Hawaiian ladies were interested in this question, which affected many of their friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll tell you, Hong Kong,” Malama confessed, as she asked Judy to help her serve tea. “I graduated from Vassar with very good grades, and I was shocked when the court said, ‘You are not competent to handle your own affairs. We will pay three white men huge salaries to do it for you.’ This was insulting, and I tried to fight back, but then I remembered what the sweet haole teachers had taught us at Hewlett Hall. I was Hawaiian. I was different. I was supposed to be incompetent, so I relaxed and found no shame in being judged a spendthrift. I love my friends, I love a guitar well played, I love the Swamp, so I have rather succumbed to the passing of the days. A little friendship, the birds in the Swamp . . . until I die. I am a spendthrift, so I suppose I deserve to be disciplined by a spendthrift trust.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Fukuda said, “What always infuriates white men, and frugal Japanese like my husband, is the way a woman like Malama gives things to her friends. This they cannot understand. In their pinched and miserable hearts they can’t understand it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s money?” Malama asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much does the spendthrift trust allow you?” Hong Kong asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t blame the trustees,” Malama evaded. “When the courts stepped in I’d worked things around so that I owed the federal government $350,000 in back taxes. Somebody had to do something. So now all I get is $22,000 a year for myself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And all her friends,” Mrs. Mendonca said. “After all, she is an alii nui and she does have some obligations.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you like the system?” Hong Kong repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I neither understand it nor like it,” Malama replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama,” Hong Kong said bluntly. “I’m going to make some radical investments for you. You’ll have two very lean years, and you’re going to make some kind of deal with the federal government, but if you behave, in three years you’ll be off the spendthrift trust.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The faces of the five Hawaiian women bloomed like flowers after a providential rain, and Hong Kong could see them envisaging endless parties, good food, new automobiles and trips to Europe, like in the old days, but Hong Kong warned bleakly, “And when you’re off the spendthrift trust, you’ll be under my supervision, and you know a Chinese is ten times tougher than a haole judge.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hawaiians laughed, for this was the truth, and Malama cried, “I hope we can do it, Hong Kong.” She kissed him on both cheeks as she placed over his head the lei he had previously given her. “I am not joking when I say that Hawaiians and Chinese have always been good for one another.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She was about to cite examples when she was interrupted by the screen door’s banging open suddenly, then slamming shut as someone retreated down the porch. “Kelly!” Malama cried. Come on in. It’s only Hong Kong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall beachboy shuffled into the room, barefoot, in his tight knee-length pants and waiter’s jacket that failed to cover his rugged chest. He wore a yachting cap far back on his head, and his black hair was uncombed. “Aptemoon, Hong Kong,” he grunted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ve been talking about plans for the trust,” Malama said graciously as she handed her son a cup of tea. He brushed it aside and plucked a few notes on his mother’s ukulele.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You da new trustee da kine?” Kelly said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Hong Kong said with obvious distaste for the pidgin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I speak true. You akamai dis trust, you fix heem up, you one damn good pella.” He banged the ukulele and pointed at his mother, adding, “Because dis wahine spend, spend.” He motioned with his uke to Mrs. Fukuda, who began strumming hers, and soon the women were singing, but as they entered into one of their most loved songs Kelly was aware of a Chinese voice, high and lyrical, and while he continued plunking his ukulele, he studied with approval the relaxed manner in which Hong Kong’s daughter sang. Then he paid no more attention to her, but at the end of the song he grabbed a guitar and began a throbbing slack-key solo, to which the other instruments gradually joined in subdued harmonies. Finally, when the slack-key had ended, with its intricate fingerings echoing in the air, Kelly plucked the first few chords of the “Hawaiian Wedding Song,” then threw the guitar to Mrs. Fukuda and rose to begin the majestic male solo. When it came time for the soprano to enter, he pushed his mother into the background, and with his right hand imperiously grabbed Judy and brought her to her feet. At the appropriate moment, he pointed at her, and for the first time in Hawaii an impressed audience heard the Chinese girl soar into the upper reaches of this passionate evocation of the islands. Her voice was like a clear bell in some island church where a true wedding was being performed, and when it came time for Kelly to join her, he did not fool around with falsettos or effects; he projected his handsome baritone until it filled the old room and caused the chandelier to sway. In the final passages Malama and the four big Hawaiian women hummed softly, so that Hong Kong remained the only listener. Against his will, for he did not like his daughter singing Hawaiian songs, he had to applaud, and the four visiting women cheered and Kelly leaped into the other room and returned with a length of tapa, which he twisted about Judy’s waist. He stuck three flowers into her braids and used his right forefinger as if it were a make-up pencil, dabbing it about her eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She gonna look more Hawaiian than I do,” he cried. Then he pointed in turn at each of his mother’s guests. “Choy!” he cried. “Fukuda, Mendonca, Rodriques, and you, Malama!” He stood back to survey them. “Tomorrow night. Your hair long. Old muumuus. Flowers. Three ukuleles, two guitars. Da Lagoon gonna hear Hawaiian music like nevah before.” He bowed to Judy and asked, “Seestah, you sing wit’ me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will,” she said simply.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama was an unusually outspoken woman, for a Hawaiian, and she asked, “Will it be taken with grace if a Chinese girl sings that particular song? It’s so especially Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Da kine people better get accustomed,” Kelly snapped, “because dis wahine … a true meadowlark.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you think, Hong Kong?” Malama asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was apparent from his scowl that he was going to reserve his negative judgment until he got Judy alone, but his daughter said for him, “He’ll be there, and so will I.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Back in the Buick, Hong Kong stormed: “I don’t want my daughter singing in a night club!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I want to sing,” Judy said firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“People will laugh, Judy. My daughter, singing in a club. You, a Chinese making believe you’re Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dad, for a long time I’ve wanted to sing . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Kelly Kanaka! A no-good, broken-down Hawaiian!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s wrong with a Hawaiian?” Judy snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t raise a respectable Chinese girl to be messing around with a Hawaiian!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re messing around, as you call it, with Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s business, Judy. You’re asking for trouble, girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You be there tomorrow night, Dad. I want to see at least one friendly face.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The team of Kelly and Judy created a sensation in more ways than one. To the mainland tourists they were the first pair in the islands who showed any real sense of professional savoir-faire, and the five powerful gray-haired women who accompanied them on that first night were remarkable, for they set off the frail beauty of the girl and the lithe young masculinity of the baritone, so that if only the tourists had to be considered, the team was both an artistic and a financial success. But to the residents of Hawaii it was shocking on two counts. To the Chinese community it was inconceivable that on the very day that Hong Kong’s appointment to the Malama Kanakoa Trust was announced, confirming as it were his respectability in the community, his well-trained daughter should appear in a public night club, her navel showing, singing and doing the hula with a man like Kelly Kanakoa. At least four major Chinese families whose sons had been thinking of marrying the delectable music teacher said flatly, “We will never accept her as a daughter-in-law.” But to the Hawaiian community it was an affront past understanding that an alii family like the Kanakoas would choose as Kelly’s singing partner a pure Chinese girl, and for her to presume to dress like an honest Hawaiian and thus palm herself off to the public was morally outrageous.</p>

  <p class="normal">So the Chinese boycotted Judy and the Hawaiians boycotted Kelly, but Manny Fineberg of Clarity Records heard them on the second night and signed them up to a profitable contract, but he did stipulate, “On the cover of the album, we got to have a pure Hawaiian girl. Judy can sing like an angel, but she can’t get over them slant-eyes.” As the young singers were driving home that night Judy said, “Kelly, I think that for our next album we ought to form our own company, right here in Hawaii.” And that was the start of Island Records, which Judy Kee ran with an iron hand, seeking out fresh talent to sing famous old songs, so that before long, half the Hawaiian, melodies played in America were produced by this clever Chinese girl.</p>

  <p class="normal">She also devised the costume by which Kelly became famous in the island night clubs. She had a tailor make him skin-tight pants, one leg blue, the other red, with frayed ends reaching below the knee. For a top she found a subdued tapalike fabric from Java and had it made into a tight jacket with long ends that tied at the waist. His hat continued to be a yachting cap, worn on the back of his head, but his shoes were heavy leather sandals which she designed and which he could kick off when he wished to dance. “You must become a visual symbol,” she insisted, and she did the same, with her exotic face framed in flowers and her two braids showing over an island sarong. But the thing that tourists remembered longest was the curious whale’s tooth that Kelly wore on a silver chain about his neck. It became his trade-mark.</p>

  <p class="normal">Judy made other changes in Kelly. When he spoke to her, he had to speak English, but when he was on the stage she encouraged him to use a wild pidgin, as when in the middle of a performance he would suddenly halt Florsheim’s guitar solo and cry, “Eh you, Florsheim blalah. Las’ night I t’ink. More’n hunnerd years ago de missionary come dis rock and find my gradfadder you gradfadder wearin’ nuttin’, doin’ nuttin’, sleepin’ under de palm tree, drinkin’ okolehau, dey raise hell. Bimeby hunnerd years later you me kanaka we doin’ all de work while de missionary kids sleepin’ under de palm tree, drinkin’ gin, wearin’ almos’ nuttin’, and doin’ nuttin’. Florsheim blalah, wha’ in hell hoppen?”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Judy who insisted that Florsheim learn to play the steel guitar with an electronic booster, and she also encouraged the big slob to dress in disreputable costumes so as to set off Kelly’s grandeur, but there were two problems concerning the huge Hawaiian that not even Judy could solve. If he was a member of a group, everyone unconsciously spoke pidgin, even Judy; and no one could keep the big man’s girls straightened out. After a while Judy stopped trying, but one change she did make. She insisted that when Kelly got cables from divorcees on the mainland, he ignore them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re an important artist, Kelly!” she hammered day after day. “You don’t have to peddle yourself to every neurotic dame who sends you a distress signal.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re friends of my friends,” he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were they good for you, Kelly?” she asked bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then cut it out,” she said simply, and in time she even got Florsheim to stop running in breathlessly with the news: “Kelly blalah, I got dem two da kine wahine, one got convertible. Kelly blalah, you help me out, huh?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was one point on which Judy Kee never deceived herself. It was true that the financial success of her trio stemmed from her managerial ability, but its artistic reception derived solely from the infectious Polynesian charm of her two companions. When tourists saw handsome Kelly and ponderous Florsheim, they instinctively loved them, for the Hawaiians reminded them of an age when life was simpler, when laughter was easier, and when there was music in the air. No stranger to Hawaii ever loved the islands because Judy Kee and her astute father Hong Kong were making profound changes in the social structure; people loved Hawaii because of the Polynesians. All Judy did was make it possible for her two beach-boys to live, for under her guidance they earned about $70,000 a year, with time off to go swimming almost every afternoon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two older people followed the regeneration of Kelly and Florsheim with interest. To Malama the arrival of the strong-minded Chinese girl was a blessing from the old gods who had looked after Hawaiians. She told her tea-party friends, “I tried to make him grow up and failed. But this little Pake says jump, and he jumps. Always in the right direction!.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hear she has the recording company in her name,” Mrs. Rodriques probed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She does,” Malama admitted. “But I suggested it. I didn’t want Kelly free to shuffle out of his arrangements.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then if he wants to get his fair share of the company, he’ll have to marry her, won’t he?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing could please me more,” Malama said frankly. Then, looking sadly out over the swamp where the alii of a past age had boated, she said softly, “By ourselves, we Hawaiians cannot maintain our position in the new world that surrounds us. I was staggering under frightful burdens till Hong Kong came along. He has such a peasant, earthy power that the boards of the porch seem a little firmer when he passes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Mendonca said, “I never thought to witness the day when you would approve the marriage of your son to a Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama continued looking out the window and said gravely, “You forget, Liliha, that she is not just a Chinese girl. She is the great-granddaughter of the Pake Kokua. When nobody else on this earth dared to help the Hawaiian lepers, that woman did. Any member of her family merits our special affection.” Then she looked back into the room and asked, “Where would Kelly be today if it were not for the Pake girl? Do you think I was happy, the way he used to live? One divorced woman after another? I wish the world could somehow maintain just a little corner where Hawaiians could live as they liked and prosper, but since that is not the way of the world, the next best thing is to have a Chinese helping us. They can’t hurt us any worse than the haoles did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think they’ll get married?” Mrs. Mendonca asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama evaded this question by volunteering a short speech: “I remember, Carry-the-Mail, when you married Leon Choy, and all the alii wept because a fine Hawaiian girl was marrying a Chinese, and I wept too, but as I recall, my father assured your father that it was all right, and that sometimes the Chinese were good people. How different things are now, because it is no longer a question, of what we five elderly Hawaiian ladies think of such a marriage. The problem is: ‘Will a leading Chinese family like Hong Kong Kee’s allow their daughter to marry a Hawaiian?’ We have fallen so swiftly on the slide of history.” She strummed idly on her ukulele while her guests picked up an old song that had come down from better days.</p>

  <p class="normal">The other older person who watched Kelly’s new position with meticulous care was Hong Kong Kee, and one night he waited up till three in the morning to greet his beautiful, competent daughter. “Were you out there kissing him in the car?” he stormed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is what the haoles call necking?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, don’t let me catch you again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then don’t peek!” And she flounced up the stairs, but he trailed after her, protesting that the entire Chinese community was worried about her. Singing in a hotel was bad enough, but now it began to look as if …</p>

  <p class="normal">“As if what?” she asked sternly, whirling about to face her anguished father.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It begins to look as if you were thinking of marrying him,” Hong Kong stammered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Judy said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, Judy!” her father gasped, and to her surprise the tough old warrior burst into tears. “You mustn’t do this!” he pleaded. “You’re a fine Chinese girl. You’ve got to think of your position in the community.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Father!” Judy cried, pulling his hands down from his red eyes. “Kelly’s a good boy. I love him and I think I’m going to marry him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Judy!” her father wept. “Don’t do it.” The noise awakened the rest of the family, and soon the hallway was filled with Kees, and when they heard Hong Kong’s ominous warning that “Judy insists she’s going to marry the Hawaiian,” her brothers began to weep, too, and one said, “Judy, you can’t bring this disgrace upon us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For some time Judy had been aware of her family’s apprehension about her growing friendship with Kelly, but she had considered it merely a normal expression of family concern. Now, as the weeping male members of her family stood about her, she realized that it was something much deeper. “You’re a Chinese girl!” Brother Eddie stammered. “Don’t you think that when I was at Harvard Law I met a lot of attractive haole girls? Even some I wanted to marry? But I didn’t do it because I thought of the family here in Hawaii. And you can’t do it, either.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Kelly’s a settled-down citizen,” Judy stubbornly repeated. “He makes more money than any of you, and if Dad can get the trust straightened out . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s a Hawaiian,” Mike said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You think I want my lovely daughter to marry a man with a vocabulary of seven hundred words, most of them seestah and blalah?” Hong Kong demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelly is an educated young man,” Judy insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Very well,” Hong Kong snapped. “If you marry him . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t say it, Father,” Judy begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you insist upon bringing disgrace upon, the whole Chinese community,” Hong Kong said ominously, we want nothing more to do with you. You’re a lost girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Kees went officially to bed, but through the night one after another crept to Judy’s room to explain how deeply they opposed such a marriage. “It isn’t that Kelly has a vocabulary of seven hundred words,” one sister whispered. “It’s that you’re a fine Chinese girl, and he’s a Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Many Chinese married Hawaiians,” Judy argued. “Look at Leon Choy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And whenever one did,” the sister explained, “we all felt sorrowful. You’re a Chinese, Judy. You can’t do this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would you feel the same way if Kelly were a haole?” Judy asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Identically,” the sister assured her. “You’re a Chinese. Marry a Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Judy Kee was a very tough-minded girl, and in spite of constantly renewed pressures from her entire family she came home one night at four and announced loudly: “Now hear this! Now hear this! Everybody wake up. The most precious flower of the Celestial Kingdom is going to marry Kelly Kanakoa. And what are you going to do about it?” She stomped off to bed and waited as one by one the family came to see if she were sober and in her right mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">At first Hong Kong flatly refused to attend the wedding, as did many of the leading Chinese and some of the remaining Hawaiian alii, but Judy said bravely, “Tonight at the Lagoon, Kelly, we’ll announce our engagement, and then we’ll sing ‘The Wedding Song’ in our own honor.” And they did, and among the tourists it was a very popular wedding, but among the affected citizens of Hawaii it was a catastrophe. At the last moment Hong Kong thought of his obligations to Malama Kanakoa, and out of respect for her, he attended the ceremony, but he would not walk down the aisle with his daughter.</p>

  <p class="normal">But at The Fort, Hong Kong found that the disgrace he was suffering through his daughter’s headstrong marriage brought him closer to his colleagues. Hewlett Janders, whose son Whip was still living with the air force man in San Francisco, said simply, “You can never tell about kids, Hong Kong.” And Hoxworth Hale, whose daughter Noelani was still brooding about the house and trying to sneak in a divorce without publicity, clapped his Chinese friend on the shoulder and confided: “We all go through it, but by God I wish we didn’t have to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You think I did right?” Hong Kong asked in a sudden longing to talk.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d attend my daughter’s wedding, no matter whom she married,” Hoxworth said flatly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m glad I did,” Hong Kong confessed. “But I can’t bring myself to visit them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait till the first baby’s born,” Hoxworth wisely counseled. “It’ll give you an excuse to retreat gracefully.” And Hong Kong agreed, but he felt that he might not want to look at a grandchild that was only half Chinese.</p>

  <p class="normal">To <span>THE SAKAGAWA FAMILY</span> 1954 was a year that brought dislocation and frustration. It started in January when iron-willed Kamejiro, whose threats about leaving America no one had taken seriously, announced unexpectedly that he was sailing on Friday to spend the rest of his life in Hiroshima-ken. Consequently, on Friday he and his bent wife boarded a Japanese freighter and without even a round of farewell dinners departed for Japan. He told the boys, “The store will pay enough to feed me in Hiroshima. I worked hard in America, and Japan can be proud of the manner in which I conducted myself. I hope that when you’re old you’ll be able to say the same.” Never a particularly sentimental man, he did not linger on deck gawking at the mountains he had pierced nor at the fields he had helped create. He led his wife below decks, where they had a sturdy meal of cold rice and fish, which they enjoyed.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was usually overlooked in both Hawaii and the mainland that of the many Orientals brought to America, a substantial number preferred returning to their homelands, and in the years after World War II there was a heavy flow from America to Japan, of which the Sakagawas formed only an inconspicuous part. With their dollar savings such emigrants were able to buy, in the forgotten rural areas of Japan, fairly substantial positions in a poverty-stricken economy, and this Kamejiro intended doing. He would buy his Japanese relatives a little more land beside the Inland Sea and there it would wait, the family homestead in Hiroshima-ken, in case his boys Goro and Shigeo ever decided to return to their homeland.</p>

  <p class="normal">The old folks’ departure grieved Shigeo, because the more solidly American he became, with a seat in the senate and a canny man like Black Jim McLafferty as his partner, the more he appreciated the virtues old Kamejiro had inculcated in his sons; but Goro felt otherwise, for although he too treasured his father’s moral teachings, he was glad to see his stern, unyielding mother go back to Japan, for he felt that this would give him a chance to keep his own wife, Akemi-san, in America. Accordingly, he and Shigeo gave Akemi a comfortable allowance, command of the Sakagawa house, and freedom from the old woman’s tyranny. The brothers never laughed at Akemi’s precise speech, and they showed her that they wanted her to stay.</p>

  <p class="normal">But it was too late. One morning, as they were breakfasting, she said, “I am going back to Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” Goro gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where will you get the money?” Shigeo said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve saved it. For a year I’ve bought nothing for myself and eaten mainly rice. I haven’t cheated you,” she insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No one’s speaking of cheating, Akemi dear,” Goro assured her. “But why are you leaving?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because Hawaii is too dreadfully dull to live in,” she replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Akemi!” Goro pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">She pushed back from the table and looked at the hard-working brothers. “In Hawaii I’m intellectually dead . . . decomposing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can you say that?” Shig interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because it’s true . . . and pitifully obvious to anyone from Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But don’t you sense the excitement here?” Shig pleaded. “We Japanese are just breaking through to power.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know what real excitement is?” she asked sorrowfully. “The excitement of ideas? Quests? I’m afraid Hawaii will never begin to understand true intellectual excitement, and I refuse to waste my life here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But don’t you find our arrival as a group of people exciting?” Shig pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” she granted, “if you were going to arrive some place important it would be exciting. But do you know what your goal is? A big shiny black automobile. You’ll never arrive at music or plays or reading books. You have a cheap scale of values, and I refuse to abide them any longer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Akemi!” Goro pleaded in real anguish. “Don’t leave. Please.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What will you do?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll get a job in a Nishi-Ginza bar where people talk about ideas,” she said flatly, and that day she started to pack.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it became obvious that she was determined to leave Hawaii, Goro disappeared from his labor office for several days, and Shigeo found him sitting dully at home, waiting for Akemi-san to return from the market, where she was informing her envious war-bride friends that she was sailing back to Japan. Goro’s eyes were red, and his hands trembled. “Do you think that all we’ve been working at is useless, Shig?” he pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t believe what this girl says,” Shig replied, sitting with his brother.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I love her. I can’t let her go!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Goro,” Shigeo said quietly, “I love Akemi-san almost as much as you do, and if she walks out, I’m broken up, too. But I’m sure of one thing. You and I are working on something so big that she can’t even dimly understand it. Give us another twenty years and we’ll build here in Hawaii a wonderland.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro knew what his brother was speaking of, but he asked, “In the meantime, do you think we’re as dull as she says?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig thought several minutes, recalling Boston, on a Friday night, and Harvard Law with its vital discussions, and Sundays at the great museums. “Hawaii’s pretty bad,” he confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you think Akemi-chan’s justified?” Goro asked with a dull ache in his voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s not big enough to overlook the fact that we’re essentially peasants,” Shig replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Goro argued contentiously. “We got good educations.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But fundamentally we’re peasants,” Shig reasoned. “Everybody who came to these islands came as illiterate peasants. The Chinese, the Portuguese, the Koreans, and now the Filipinos. We were all honest and hard-working, but, by God, we were a bunch of Hiroshima yokels.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro, lacerated by his wife’s threatened desertion, would not accept this further castigation and cried, “Yokels or not, our people now get a decent wage in the sugar fields and our lawyers get elected to the legislature. I call that something.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s everything,” Shig agreed, pressing his arm about his brother’s shoulder. “The other things that Akemi-chan misses . , . they’ll come later. It’s our children who’ll read books and listen to music. They won’t be peasants.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro now changed from misery to belligerency and cried, “Hell, fifty years from now they’ll put up statues to guys like you and me!” And he thought of many things he was going to tell his wife when she returned, but when he saw her come into the room, after carefully removing her geta at the door and walking pin-toed like a delicate Japanese gentlewoman, his courage collapsed and he pleaded, “Akemi-chan, please, please don’t go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She walked past him and into her room, where she completed her final packing and when she was ready to go to the boat she said softly, “I’m not running away from you, Goro-san. You were good to me and tender. But a girl has only one life and I will not spend mine in, Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’ll grow better!” he assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">In precise Japanese the determined girl replied, “I would perish here.” And that afternoon she sailed for Japan.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mr. Ishii, of course, wrote a long letter in Japanese script to the Sakagawas in Hiroshima-ken, and when the local letter reader had advised Mrs. Sakagawa of its contents, Goro began getting a series of delighted letters from his mother, which Ishii-san read to the boys, for although they could speak Japanese they could not read it: “I am so glad to hear that the superior-thinking young lady from Tokyo has gone back home. It’s best for all concerned, Goro, and I have been asking through the village about suitable girls, and I have found several who would be willing to come to America, but you must send me a later picture of yourself, because the one I have makes you look too young, and the better girls are afraid that you are not well established in business. I am sending you in this letter pictures of three very fine girls. Fumiko-san is very strong and comes from a family I have known all my life. Chieko-san is from a very dependable family and when made-up looks rather sweet. Yuri-san is too short, but she has a heart which I know is considerate, for her mother, whom I knew as a girl, tells me that Yuri is the best girl in the village where taking care of a home is concerned. Also, since Shigeo now has a good job and ought to be looking for a wife, I am sending him two pictures of the schoolteacher in the village. She is well educated and would make a fine wife for a lawyer, because even though she went away to college, she is originally from this village. After the grave mistake Goro made with the girl from Tokyo, I am sure it would be better if you boys both found your wives at home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The brothers spread the five photographs on the table and studied them gloomily. “It’s too bad we’re not raising sugar cane,” Goro growled. “That quartet could hoe all the fields between here and Waipahu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The next mail brought three more applicants, stalwart little girls with broad bottoms, gold teeth and backs of steel. Mr. Ishii, after reading the letters to the brothers, got great pleasure from studying the photographs and making therefrom his own recommendations. “Of all the things I have done in my life,” he explained, “I am happiest that I married a Hiroshima girl. If you boys were wise, you would do the same thing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then came the letter that contained two better-than-average pictures, and as they fluttered out, Mr. Ishii studied the portraits with care and said, “I think these may be the ones,” but his spirits were soon dampened by a passage from Mrs. Sakagawa which he could not find the courage to finish reading to the boys. It began, “Last week danna-san and I went to see Hiroshima City, a place we had not visited before, and I am ashamed to have to say that what the Americans reported is true. The city was bombed. It was mostly destroyed and you can still see the big black scars. Ishii-san, who will be reading this letter to you, ought to know that the damage was very bad and from looking at this city I don’t see how anyone could believe any longer that Japan won the . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mr. Ishii’s voice trailed off. For a long time he sat looking at the fatal pages. Coming as they did, from his own mother-in-law, and a Hiroshima woman too, he could not doubt their veracity; but accepting her statement meant that all his visions for the past thirteen years since Pearl Harbor were fallacious, his life a mockery. The boys were considerate enough not to mention the facts which their mother had hammered home, and when the time came for them to go to work, they said good-bye to the little old man, their brother-in-law, and left him staring at the letter.</p>

  <p class="normal">At about eleven that morning a Japanese man came running into the law offices of McLafferty and Sakagawa, shouting in English, “Jesus Christ! He did it on the steps of the Japanese Consulate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig experienced a sinking feeling in his throat and mumbled, “Ishii-san?” And the informant veiled, “Yes. Cut his belly right open.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll go with you,” McLafferty called, and the two partners roared up Nuuanu to where, from the days of the first Japanese in Hawaii, the little bow-legged laborers had taken their troubles. At the consulate a group of police waited for an ambulance, which in due time screamed up, and Shig said, “I’m a relative. I’ll go with him.” But the little old labor leader was dead. He had felt that if his fatherland had indeed lost the war, the only honorable thing he could do was to inform the emperor of his grief, so he had gone to the emperor’s building, and with the emperor’s flag in his left hand, had behaved as his institutions directed. With his death, the Ever-Victorious Group died also, and the sadness of national defeat was at last brought home even to the farthest remnants of the Japanese community.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the funeral Shigeo faced his first difficult decision of the year, for Goro hurried home late one afternoon with this dismaying news: “The communist trials begin next month, and Rod Burke wants you to defend him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig dropped his head. “I knew it would come . . . sooner or later,” he said. “But why does he have to ask me just as I’m getting ready to run for a full term as senator?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro replied, “That’s when the case was called. Will you take the job?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig had anticipated that the communists would seek him as their counsel, and he had tried to formulate a satisfactory reply to the invitation; but whereas it is easy to prefabricate an answer to an expected question like “Shall we go to Lahaina next week?” it is not so easy to anticipate the moral and emotional entanglements involved in a more complex question like, “Am I, as a lawyer, obligated to provide legal aid to a communist?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wish you hadn’t asked me,” Shig stalled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wish Rod hadn’t asked me,” Goro countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you determined to help him?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, I’d have accomplished nothing without him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you’re sure he’s guilty?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suppose so,” Goro grunted. “But even a communist is entitled to a fair trial . . . and a defending lawyer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because you’re my brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t answer this one so fast, Goro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Neither could I at first,” Goro said. “Take your time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Shigeo spent long hours walking the streets of Kakaako, wondering what he ought to do. He reasoned: “In Hawaii I have one overriding responsibility—the land laws. To do anything about these, I’ve got to keep getting re-elected. If I defend Rod Burke, I’ll surely lose all the haole votes I apparently picked up last time, and that would mean I’d be licked in November. So from that point of view I ought to say no.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Rod Burke isn’t the only defendant. There’s his Japanese wife and two other Japanese. And if I go into court and give those people a stirring defense, I’ll bind the Japanese vote to me forever, simply because I have dared to defend the underdog. So although I might lose this election, I’d probably be in stronger position next time, and the time after that.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But are my personal interests the ones that ought to determine this decision? A man, charged with a crime has a right to a lawyer, and when the community is most strongly against him, his right is morally greatest. Somebody has got to defend Rod Burke, and I suppose it ought to be me.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I am not just the average, non-attached lawyer of the case books. I’m the first Japanese to get into the senate from the Nineteenth. I’m the one who has a chance of getting in again. If my brother Goro has come to represent labor, then I represent a cross-section of all the Japanese. That’s a major responsibility which I ought not destroy carelessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But there are others in our family than Goro and me. There are Tadao and Minoru, and they gave their lives defending an ideal America. They never found it for themselves . . . certainly not here in Hawaii. But in Italy and France, fighting to defend America, they did find it. So did Goro and I. And what we found is definitely threatened by a communist conspiracy. How then can I go into court and defend identified communists?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then came the question of the age. It struck Shigeo as he was walking past a sashimi parlor on Kakaako Street, as it was striking hundreds of similar Americans in garages or at the movies or in church: “But if I turn my back on a supposed communist, how do I know that I am not turning my back on the very concept of liberty that I am seeking to protect? Honest men can always get someone to defend them. But what does justice mean if apparently dishonest men can find no one?”</p>

  <p class="normal">So through this precise waltz the mind of Shigeo Sakagawa swayed, day after day. Finally he took his confusion to Black Jim McLafferty, asking, “How are you going to feel, Jim, first, as head of the Democratic Party, and second, as head of McLafferty and Sakagawa, if your partner defends the communists?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now it was Black Jim’s turn to follow the devious paths of logic, emotion, politics, patriotism and self-interest. His two most interesting comments were stolen right from his father’s Boston experiences: “It never hurts a Democratic lawyer to defend the underdog,” and “As long as my half of our partnership is known to be Catholic, you’re fairly free to defend whom you want to.” Then, drawing from his Hawaiian experience, he added, “It would be a damned shame for the first Japanese elected from the Nineteenth to be thrown out of office on an irrelevancy.” But prudently he refused to give a concrete recommendation.</p>

  <p class="normal">With McLafferty’s concepts adding to his confusion, Shigeo walked more miles, and the consideration which finally made up his mind for him was one that seemed at first wholly irrelevant. He recalled Akemi-san, his former sister-in-law, saying, on the day she left Hawaii, “In the entire Japanese community of Hawaii I have never encountered one idea.” And Shig thought: “I have an idea. I have a concept that will move the entire community ahead,” and he decided not to imperil his land-reform movement, so he refused his brother’s request. “I won’t defend the communists,” he said, “and may God forgive me if it is cowardice.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“At least I do,” Goro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">This long travail explained why, when the electioneering season finally opened, Senator Shigeo Sakagawa spoke with unusual force and seriousness on the problem of land reform. He drew up charts showing how The Fort, and its members through their directorships on the great trusts, controlled the land of Hawaii. He pointed out how they released this land in niggardly amounts, not for social purposes, but to keep up values, “the way the diamond merchants of South Africa release an agreed-upon number of diamonds each year, to keep up prices. It’s legitimate to do that with diamonds, which a man can buy or not, as he pleases, but is it right to do it with land, upon which we all exist or perish?”</p>

  <p class="normal">His most damning chart was one which showed that certain families contrived to have their land, which they held back for speculation, assessed by a compliant government at two per cent of its real value, whereas three hundred typical shopkeepers with small holdings from which they lived had theirs assessed at fifty-one per cent of its real value. “You and I,” Shig cried to his audiences, “are subsidizing the big estates. We allow them to pay no taxes. We encourage them to hold their land off the market. We permit them a tax refuge under which they can speculate. I am not angry at these families. I wish I were as smart as they appear to be. Because you and I know that when they sold their last piece of land to Gregory’s for the big new store, they sold it for $3,000,000. What value had they been paying taxes on? $71,000. Because you and I have been careless, we have allowed the Hewletts to keep valuable land off the market and pay taxes on it at one-fortieth of its real value.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In public parks, on the radio and on television Shigeo Sakagawa hammered home his dominant theme, and when citizens asked him if he was a radical, advocating the breaking up of landed estates the way they did in Russia, he kept his temper and replied, “No, I am a conservative English parliamentarian, trying to do in Hawaii what men like me accomplished in England one hundred years ago. Remember this. I am the conservative. It is the people who think that this problem can be endlessly postponed who are the radicals. Because their course leads to tragedy, mine to democracy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But at every rally somebody sooner or later heckled: “Aren’t you a communist, too, like your brother Goro?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shigeo had worked out a good answer to this question. He dropped his arms, looked off into space, and said quietly, “In any American election that’s a fair question, and the voters have a right to an honest answer. I wonder in what form I can best give you my answer?” He seemed to be thinking, and after a moment, in a very relaxed voice he started speaking.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is the man who asked that question old enough to remember the McKinley-Punahou game of 1938? It was in the last fifteen seconds of the game, if you’ll remember, and Punahou was trailing by four points, 18-14. Then, from a rather rough scrimmage, Punahou’s star back broke loose, and I can see him now dashing down the sideline . . . ten yards, twenty, forty. He was going to score a magnificent touchdown and win the game, and I can remember even to this day how thrilled I was to see that run, because that runner was my brother Tadao Sakagawa, the first ordinary Japanese ever to get into Punahou and one of the greatest stars they ever had.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But can you recall what happened next? From the McKinley players a tackle got up from one knee and started out like a fire engine after my brother, and although Tad could run fast, this McKinley man ran like the wind, and on the five-yard line, that close mind you, this McKinley man brought my brother down and saved the game. You all know who he was. He was my other brother, Goro, the one who had wanted to get into Jefferson and couldn’t.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now the point of my story is this. Goro could have held back and let his brother Tad score the winning touchdown and be the biggest hero of the year, but he never wavered in his duty. He tackled his own brother on the five-yard line and saved the day. That’s the way we Sakagawas were brought up by our parents. Duty, duty, duty.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the more important point of my story is this. Do you know where the great halfback Tadao Sakagawa is now? Buried beneath a military cross in the Punchbowl. He gave his life for America. And where is his brother, Minoru Sakagawa? Buried beneath a military cross in the Punchbowl. He also gave his life for his country. That is also the kind of boys we Sakagawas are. Tough, resolute, uncompromising fighters.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will tell you this. If my brother Goro Sakagawa was, as you charge, a communist, I would personally hound him out of the islands. I would never cease fighting him. I would tackle him down the way he tackled down Tadao, for I will make no compromise with communism.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then his voice would take on a harder tone as he continued: “But Goro Sakagawa is not a communist. He is a very fine labor leader, and the good he has done for the working people of Hawaii is beyond calculation. I am for such labor leaders, and I want that fact to be widely known. Goro and I are two edges of the same sword, he in labor, I in politics. We are cutting away old and unfair practices. We are slashing at the relics of feudalism.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In conclusion his voice changed to one of exhortation: “And neither Goro nor I will stop, because we can remember the day our father took us to the old plantation camp on Kauai and showed us the barracks where the lunas used to tramp through with whips and lash the field hands, and we swore that that would stop. Now, sir, you who asked the question about communism, I want to ask you two questions in return: where were you when, my brothers Minoru and Tadao were giving their lives for American democracy? What have you done comparable to what Goro and I have done to clean up the democracy they saved? Won’t you please come up to see me after the rally, and if you have done half as much as we have done, I want to embrace you as a damned good American, because, brother, you are certainly not a communist, nor am I.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The audience always applauded madly at this point, and when Black Jim McLafferty first heard the reply he cried, “My God, we’ve got to plant somebody in the audience to ask that question every night. I never heard a better answer. Demagoguery at its best, and of course you know what they call demagoguery at its best? Oratory.” But Shig refused to have anybody planted, because he was afraid that that might cut the edge of his conviction, because his answer had this merit: on more than half the occasions at which he used it, the questioner did come up afterwards to talk about old army days or the unhappy plantation experiences of his family, so that Shig’s reply actually converted hecklers into supporters, which, as McLafferty pointed out, “is about the best you can expect of any answer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But one thing that McLafferty said rankled in Shig’s memory: the word demagoguery. “Am I guilty of that?” he asked himself, and as he analyzed each portion of his well-known reply; he could explain everything until he got to the part about the lunas, and then he always stumbled. “What actually happened?” he asked himself. “One day, one luna hit my father one time. The first time Pop told about it, he told the truth. ‘Here is where the luna hit me that day.’ Then our family constructed the legend: ‘Here is where the lunas used to beat us.’ And finally it comes out: ‘Here is where the lunas used to beat all the Japanese.’” And he saw clearly that this conversion of the truth was indeed demagoguery of the worst sort, because it kept alive community hatreds, which, even if they had been legitimately founded were better dead in the graves of memory; but the speech did get votes, and one night after a particularly heated rally he put the problem frankly to Black Jim. “That part about the lunas beating the Japanese? Do you think I ought to keep saying that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Black Jim was tooling his old Pontiac down Kapiolani Boulevard and for some time said nothing. Then grudgingly he admitted, “It gets votes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I asked was, What do you think of it?’” Shig pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, when I hear it coming, I usually go out in the alley,” Black Jim confessed. “Just in case I have to vomit.” So Shig dropped that part of his demagoguery, but he noticed that when Goro unveiled the murals at his new labor headquarters, there was the plantation camp with lunas slashing their way through the laborers with bull whips, and Shigeo thought: “This is the greatest evil that grows out of a wrong act. Somebody always remembers it … in an evil way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the campaign reached its height, complicated by the trial of the communists, Shigeo received in his office a visitor he had never heard of and whose existence surprised him. It was a young haole woman, twenty-six years old and marked by a pallid beauty. She said nervously, “My name is Noelani Hale Janders. I’m divorced but I haven’t taken back my maiden name. I like what you’ve been saying on the radio, and I wish to work in your campaign.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What was the name again?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Noelani Hale is my real name,” she explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What Hale is that?” Shig asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hoxworth Hale is my father.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sit down,” Shig said weakly. When he had caught control of himself he pointed out, “Are you sure you’ve heard what I’ve been saying, Mrs. Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s Mrs. Janders,” Noelani said. “Didn’t you read about my divorce? It was rather messy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t,” Shig apologized.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand very well what you’re saying, Senator Sakagawa, and your views coincide with my own.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But have you heard what I said about land reform?” he pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what we’re talking about,” Noelani said in her precise Bostonian accent.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You would hurt your father very much if you were active in my campaign,” Shigeo warned. “As a matter of fact, you would probably hurt me, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I studied politics at Wellesley,” she replied firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were you at Wellesley?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“While you were at Harvard,” she said. “Amy Fukugawa pointed you out one day, at the symphony.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s Amy doing?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She married a Chinese boy. Both their parents disowned them, so they’re very happy in New York. He’s a lawyer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you understand what I’m saying about land reform, Mrs. Janders? How what I say will affect your father, and his friends?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to know just one thing,” Noelani said. “When you speak of breaking up the big estates . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not sure I’ve ever used that phraseology,” he corrected. “I say that the big estates must not be allowed to hold out of productive use the land they are not using for constructive agriculture.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Noelani sighed with relief and said, “But under your system would you permit lands that are being used legitimately for sugar and pineapple some kind of preferential treatment?” “Look, Mrs. Janders,” Shig cried. “Apparently I haven’t made myself clear on this point.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You haven’t,” she said, “and that’s why I wanted to help, because I knew you were too smart not to have thought about the fundamental problem of land in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What problem do you mean?” the expert asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">She picked up two books and placed them on the desk. “Let’s call this book Hawaii,” she said, “and this one California. Now our problem is to get all the things we need, like food and building materials and luxuries, from California out here to Hawaii, and also to pay for them after we get them here. Let’s call this inkwell our ship. We can fill it up in California every day of the year and haul to Hawaii the things we need. But how are we going to pay for them? And what is the ship going to carry back from Hawaii to California, so that it won’t have to go back empty, which would double the freight costs on everything?”</p>

  <p class="normal">She paused, and Shigeo plopped the inkwell down on the Hawaii book, saying, “I know very well that the ship has got to take back some bulk crop like sugar or pineapple. The sale of agricultural products provides the money on which we live. And the freight that sugar and pineapple pay going to the mainland helps pay the freight of food and lumber coming this way. I know that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You certainly haven’t explained it to the people,” Noelani said critically. “Because the important point is this. You fighting young Japanese have got to reassure Hawaii that legitimate farm lands will be protected for the welfare of everybody. As to the lands that have been hiding along the edges of the legitimate farms, held there for tax-free speculation, I think even, my father knows they must be sold off to the people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You spoke of helping,” Shig said. “What did you have in mind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d like to help you put into words, for the radio and television, just what we’ve been talking about. It will insure your election.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But why should Hoxworth Hale’s daughter want to help a Japanese get elected?” Shig asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because I love these islands, Senator. My people were here long before yours arrived, so I am naturally concerned about what happens to Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You ought to be a Republican,” Shig said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For the time being, they’re worn out,” Noelani replied. “I’ve been living a long time with worn-out people, so I’m ready to accept new ideas.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig felt certain that when Hoxworth Hale saw his daughter’s car with its bright-red bumper-banner, “Please Re-elect Senator Shigeo Sakagawa” the commander of The Fort would explode, but instead a most unexpected event transpired, for one afternoon Hong Kong Kee strolled into the McLafferty and Sakagawa offices and sat down with Shig. “I am in lots of trouble if my Republican friends see me down here,” the Chinese said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s up?” Shig inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have a big surprise for you, Shigeo,” Hong Kong confided.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Trouble?” Shig asked, for in an election period every visitor brings anxiety.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In a way,” Hong Kong confessed. “Hoxworth Hale and his boys commissioned me to ask you how about coming on the board of Whipple Oil Imports, Incorporated. They figure a smart young Japanese on the board will help them sell more to Japanese customers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig was quite unprepared for such a suggestion and studied Hong Kong carefully. He liked the shrewd Chinese, and appreciated what he had done for the Sakagawas, never mind the motives. But he was appalled that Hong Kong had consented to be used so crudely by The Fort in an attempt at political blackmail, and it was with difficulty that he restrained himself when he replied, coldly, “The Fort cannot buy me off on this land-reform business, and you can tell them so.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong instantly realized the unfavorable position he appeared to be in, but instead of showing his embarrassment he said quietly, “Nobody at the Fort wants you, Shigeo, if your price is no higher than that. They know you’re going to fight this land deal through to a conclusion. But what you don’t know is, they’re not too worried. They know it’s inevitable.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So they offer me a trivial directorship at such a time! It’s contemptible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Shigeo, it’s sensible. Two years ago they asked me to nominate some promising young Japanese. I said Shigeo. Last year they asked again. I said Shigeo. This is not a hasty idea. The Fort has had you in mind for a long time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d be false to my people if I joined up with their principal enemy,” Shig said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe when you get elected one more time, Shigeo, you will stop talking about ‘my people.’ All the people in Hawaii are your people, and you better start thinking that way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If I took a job from The Fort, every Japanese in Hawaii would say I had turned traitor,” Shig replied truthfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll tell you this, Shigeo,” the quick-minded Chinese corrected. “Until the time comes when you accept a job with The Fort, on your own terms, you are a traitor to your people. The whole purpose of you young Japanese getting elected to office, and you know how strong I work for you, is to bring you into the full society of Hawaii. You’ve got to get on the boards. You’ve got to get appointed trustees for the big estates.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Trustees?” Shig laughed. “After what I’ve been shouting about the estates?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Exactly,” Hong Kong replied. “Because if you show yourself interested, before the year ends you’ll be suggested as a trustee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“By whom?” the young senator asked contemptuously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“By Hoxworth Hale and me,” Hong Kong snapped. And as the young Japanese fell silent, the Chinese banker explained his view of Hawaii. He said: “The haoles are smarter than I used to think, Shigeo. First they worked the Hawaiians, and threw them out. Then they brought in my grandmother, and threw her out. Then they got your father, and dropped him when the Filipinos looked better. They always pick the winner, these haoles, and I respect them for it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So I work hard and show them I can run real estate better than they can, and they make me a partner. Other educated Chinese are breaking in, too. If you smart young Japanese don’t pretty soon start joining up in the real running of Hawaii, it only means you aren’t clever enough for anybody to want you. Getting elected is the easy part, Shigeo, because you can rely upon stupid people to do that for you, but getting onto the boards, and running the schools, and directing the trusts is the real test. Because there you have to be selected by the smartest people in Hawaii. Shigeo, I want you to join this board.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young Japanese thought for a long time. If he were to join, he would be a spiritual traitor to his family and to his class. He could no longer say to his Japanese friends, “It was in the fields of Kauai that the lunas used to horsewhip our fathers. Well, those days are past.” He would lose the sweet solidarity that he felt when he and Goro and the other young Japanese swore: “We are as good as the haoles.” He would lose so much that had kept him fighting.</p>

  <p class="normal">He temporized: “Hong Kong, you must know that no matter what The Fort offers me, I’m still going to fight for this land reform.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Damn it!” Hong Kong cried. “It’s because you’re going to fight for it that they want you. They know you’re right, Shigeo.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right!” the young senator snapped. “Tell them that after the election I’ll join.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“After the election it will have no moral force,” Hong Kong pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“After the election,” Shigeo repeated, and he applied himself with greater dedication to the campaign that was to alter life in Hawaii, for he and Black Jim McLafferty had whipped together a sterling slate of young Japanese veterans. All the boys were mainland-educated. Some appeared on the hustings lacking arms that had been lost in Italy or legs shot off in France, and if they had so desired, they could have appeared with their chests covered with medals. In contrast to former elections, the serious young men spoke on issues, and pressed home Senator Shigeo Sakagawa’s figures on land reform. There was great excitement in the air, as if this October were an intellectual April with ideas germinating.</p>

  <p class="normal">One night Noelani Janders said, as she drove Shigeo home from four outdoor rallies, “For a moment tonight, Shig, I had the fleeting sensation that we were going to win control of both the house and the senate. There’s a real chance that a hell of a lot of you Japanese are going to be elected. It’s terribly exciting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the campaign, at least so far as Shigeo Sakagawa was concerned, fell completely apart, because one day without any previous announcement, old Kamejiro and his stooped wife climbed down off a Japanese freighter, took a bus out to Kakaako, and announced: “We have decided to live in America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro and Shig embraced them as warmly as their stubborn, rocklike father would allow and tried to uncover the reasons for this sudden change of plans. All they could get from Kamejiro was this: “I’m too old to learn to use those goddamned Japanese toilets. I can’t stay bent down that long.” He would say no more.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Sakagawa allowed several hints to fall. Once she observed: “The old man said he had grown, so soft in America that he was no longer fit to be a real Japanese.” At another time she said sorrowfully, “If you have been away from a farm for fifty-two years, when you go back the fields look smaller.” As for herself, she said simply, “The Inland Sea is so terribly cold in winter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Once, in late October when Shigeo was particularly nervous over the election, he snapped at his father: “I’ve seen a hundred of you people leave Hawaii, saying, ‘I’m going back to the greatest land on earth!’ But when you get there, you don’t like it so much, do you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">To his surprise old Kamejiro strode up to him, drew back and belted him severely across the face. “You’re a Japanese!” he said fiercely. “Be proud of it!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Sakagawa had come home with several new photographs of Hiroshima-ken girls, and she arranged them on the kitchen table, admiringly, but when her boys showed no interest she sadly put them away. One night when she could not sleep she saw her youngest son come driving home with a haole girl, and it looked to her as if he had kissed the girl, and she called her husband and they confronted Shigeo, fearfully, and said, “Did you come home with a haole girl?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the young senator replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” his mother groaned. “Kamejiro, speak to him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The embittered session lasted for some hours, with old Kamejiro shouting, “If you get mixed up with a haole woman, all Japan will be ashamed!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Sakagawa held that it was the gods themselves who had inspired her return to America in time to save her son from such an irrevocable disgrace. She wept, “With all the fine girls I told you about from Hiroshima, why do you ride home with a haole?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Strong threats were made, in the course of which Shigeo’s mother cried, “It’s almost as bad as if you married a Korean,” at which Goro, who was now awake, pointed out, “Who said anything about getting married?” and Mrs. Sakagawa replied, “It’s the same everywhere. Haole girls, Korean girls, Okinawa girls, Eta girls, all trying to trap decent Japanese boys.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was too much for Goro, who suggested, “Mom, go to bed,” but when she saw in Goro visible proof of the wreck her older son had made of his life she wept again and mourned, “You wouldn’t listen to me. You went ahead and married a Tokyo girl, and see what happened. Let me warn you, Shigeo, haole girls are even worse than Tokyo girls. Much worse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro pleaded ineffectively, “Shig, tell her that you’re not marrying the girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw him kissing her!” his mother cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mom,” Goro cried. “I kissed a Filipino girl the other night. But I’m not marrying her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Sakagawa stopped her ranting. Dropping her arms she stared at her son and repeated dully, “A Filipino girl?” The idea was so completely repugnant that she could find no words with which to castigate it, so she turned abruptly on her heel and went to bed. Chinese girls, Okinawans, even Koreans you could fight. But a Filipino!</p>

  <p class="normal">When the old people were gone, Goro asked quietly, “There’s nothing between you and the haole, is there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think so,” Shig replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, blalah,” Goro said, reverting to an old and dear phrase of their pidgin childhood, “she’s a Hale, a Janders, a haole, a divorcee, all in one. Don’t try it. You’re strong, but you’re not that strong.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Election Day, 1954, was one that will never be forgotten in Hawaii. Hula teams surrounded voting places. Candidates wearing mountainous flowered leis passed out sandwiches to haole voters and sushi to Japanese. Bands blared all day long, and trucks with long streamers ploughed through the streets. It was a noisy, gala, wonderful day, and that night when the votes were tallied, Hawaii realized with astonished pain that for the first time since the islands had joined America, Democrats were going to control both houses. The days were forever past when Republicans dominated by The Fort could rule the islands with impunity.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, toward midnight, when each specific contest approached final settlement, a second discovery was made, even more sobering than the first. Of the Democratic victors, the majority were going to be young Japanese. In the senate, out of fifteen seats, Japanese won seven. In the house, out of thirty seats, Japanese won fourteen. On the board that ran Honolulu, out of seven vacancies, Japanese won four, and at midnight Hewie Janders, sitting glumly with John Whipple Hoxworth and the Hewlett boys, faced the unpalatable facts: “Gentlemen, we are now to be governed from Tokyo. And may God help us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Black Jim McLafferty’s team of brilliant young Japanese war veterans had swept into commanding power. Their average age was thirty-one. The average number of major wounds they had received in battle was two. Their average number of medals was four. They were honor graduates, of great mainland universities like Harvard, Columbia, Michigan, and Stanford, and together they would compose the best-educated, most-decorated group of legislators elected that day in any of the forty-eight American states; there would be no finer legislature than that put together by the serious young Japanese lawyers of Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">Some pages back in this memoir I predicted that when, in 1916, the drunken luna Von Schlemm unfairly thrashed the sick Japanese field hand Kamejiro Sakagawa, the act was bound to have historic consequences which would not appear obvious for nearly forty years. Now, on Election Day of 1954, this old and almost forgotten event came home to roost. The Japanese, convinced that their laboring parents had been abused by the lunas, voted against the Republicans who had supervised that abuse. Von Schlemm’s single blow had been transmuted by oratory into daily thrashings. In the early part of the campaign Senator Sakagawa, who should have known better, used this incident to lure the Japanese vote, but later he had the decency to drop such inflammatory rabble-rousing. In the labor troubles that haunted our islands, Goro Sakagawa originally used this same incident to inflame his workers, but later he also reconsidered and abandoned his irresponsible harangues. Nevertheless, for a few months in 1954 it looked as if a deep schism had been driven down the middle of our community, pitting Japanese against haole, but the Sakagawa boys had the courage to back away from that tempting, perilous course. They reconciled haole and Japanese, and it is to their credit that they did so. If there was one man in the history of Hawaii that I should have liked to strangle, it was that accidental, unthinking luna Von Schlemm. By the grace of God, our islands finally exorcised the evil that he so unwittingly initiated.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the election returns were all in, toward two in the morning, and the Democratic victors were flushed with congratulations, Black Jim McLafferty leaned back in his chair at headquarters and warned Senator Sakagawa: “This victory is going to delay statehood. Last year our enemies rejected us on the grounds that Hawaii wasn’t ready because the Japanese weren’t Americanized. When they hear these returns, they’ll reject us again because you Orientals are too damned well Americanized. But whether we ever become a state or not, we’re going to build a great Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His reflections were interrupted by the entrance into headquarters of a man whom no one expected to see there, for stern, black-coated Hoxworth Hale appeared bearing a maile lei whose fragrance was apparent even above the tobacco smoke and the shouting. The commander of The Fort looked gloomily about the unfamiliar terrain, then saw Shigeo Sakagawa among a group of cheering friends and noticed the bright-red lipstick on his yellow cheek, as if strangers had been kissing him. Moving toward the most important victor in the senatorial contests, Hoxworth extended his hand and said, Congratulations.” Then he placed the maile chain about the young Japanese boy’s shoulders and said, “You’ll forgive me if I don’t…”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll do that for you, Dad,” Noelani said, adding her lipstick to the collection.&#160;&#160; Hoxworth studied the victorious senator for a moment and asked wryly “How is it none of you smart young fellows are Republicans? “You never invited us,” Shig replied with a nervous laugh In distinct tones that many could overhear, Hoxworth said,&#160;&#160; Well, I want it on record this time, Senator Sakagawa. I’m inviting you to join the board of Whipple Oil. I would be proud to work with a man like you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The crowd gasped, and Shigeo replied, “On the morning after I introduce my land-reform bill, I’ll join you. That is, supposing you still want me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">&#160;&#160; “You’d be foolish to accept before,” Hoxworth said, and with this the proud, lonely man, descendant of the missionaries and owner of the islands, excused himself from a celebration where he was not wholly at ease. When he was gone, Shig’s friends cried, My God! He asked a Japanese to join his board,” but Noelani said “That’s not important. Look! He gave Shig a maile lei. Coming from my father that’s better than a crown.”</p>

  <p class="normal">I can speak with a certain authority about these matters, because I participated in them. I knew these Golden Men: the lyric beach-boy Kelly Kanakoa; the crafty Chinese banker Hong Kong Kee; and the dedicated Japanese politician Shigeo Sakagawa. I was there when they became vital parts of the new Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was I who engineered the coalition that defeated Senator Sakagawa’s radical land reform. It was I who warned Noelani Janders against the needless folly of falling in love with a Japanese boy, and I told Shigeo Sakagawa frankly that he would damage his career if he allowed it; for in an age of Golden Men it is not required that their bloodstreams mingle, but only that their ideas clash on equal footing and remain free to cross-fertilize and bear new fruit.</p>

  <p class="normal">So at the age of fifty-six I, Hoxworth Hale, have discovered that I, too, am one of those Golden Men who see both the West and the East, who cherish the glowing past and who apprehend the obscure future; and the things I have written of in this memoir are very close to my heart.</p>
