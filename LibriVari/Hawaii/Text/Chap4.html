  <h2>IV<br/>From the Starving Village</h2>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THE YEAR</span> 817, when King Tamatoa VI of Bora Bora and his brother Teroro fled to Havaiki-of-the-North, there to establish a new society, the northern sections of China were ravaged by an invading horde of Tartars whose superior horsemanship, primitive moral courage and lack of hesitation in applying brute force quickly overwhelmed the more sophisticated Chinese, who vainly and at times only half-heartedly tried to resist them. As the difficult years passed, Peking fell, and the coastal cities, and it became apparent that the Tartars had entered China to stay.</p>

  <p class="normal">The effect of the invasion fell most heavily upon the great Middle Kingdom, the heartland of China, for it was these lush fields and rich cities that the Tartars sought, so toward the middle of the century they dispatched an army southward to invest HunanProvince, some three hundred and fifty miles below Peking and south of the Yellow River. In Hunan at this time there lived a cohesive body of Chinese known by no special name, but different from their neighbors. They were taller, more conservative, spoke a pure ancient language uncontaminated by modern flourishes, and were remarkably good farmers. When the Tartar pressures fell heavily upon their immediate neighbors to the north, those neighbors supinely accepted the invaders, and this embittered the group of which I now wish to speak.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a mountain village, in the year 856, the farmer Char Ti Chong, a tall, thin man with handsome high-boned face and a profusion of black hair which he wore in an unruly manner, swore to his wife Nyuk Moi, “We will not surrender these good lands to the barbarians.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What can you do?” his stolid, sensible wife countered, for in her twenty-three years with Char she had heard some fairly far-reaching promises, most of which had come to nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will resist them!” Char proposed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“With grain stalks as an army?” Nyuk Moi asked wearily. She was a thin, angular woman who seemed always on the verge of complaining, but her life was so difficult that she rarely wasted her strength in whining. Her hopeful father had named her after the most beautiful object he had seen, a scintillating pendant resting among a rich man’s jewels; unfortunately, she had not lived up to this name, Nyuk Moi, Plum Jade, but she possessed what was better than beauty: an absolutely realistic evaluation of life. “So you are determined to fight the invaders?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will destroy them!” her husband repeated stoutly, certain that his boasts had already made his lands more secure.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were not good lands, and in other parts of the world they would hardly have been deemed worthy of defense, for although the Middle Kingdom contained many rich fields, farmer Char had none of them. His three acres lay tilted skyward at the point where the rocks of the Hunan mountains met what might charitably be called the arable fields. There was no running water, only sporadic rainfall, and the soil was not markedly productive. But largely because of Char’s endless effort, this land did sustain a family of nine: Char, his wife Nyuk Moi, his old and battle-worn mother, and six children. The living was not good, for the Chars had no ducks or chickens, and only two pigs, but it was no worse than that enjoyed by most of the other families in the mountainous village.</p>

  <p class="normal">What the invading Tartars would have done with this walled-in village, had they ever got to it, was a mystery, for they could scarcely have squeezed out of it a single grain of wheat more than it already yielded, and if they took much away, the village would starve, but it became a fixation with Char and his friends that the Tartars, after satiating themselves with Peking, were certain to burst into this ancient village, so that the farmers formed the habit of convening each night in the farmhouse of their wisest member, General Ching, to discuss plans for the defense of their land, for now there was no government to protect them.</p>

  <p class="normal">This Ching was not a real general, of course, but merely a stocky, red-faced wanderer who had chanced to be near Peking one day when the emperor’s henchmen required an army in a hurry. Ching had been swept up, and in a long campaign found that he liked military life, which was a disreputable fact in itself. After the war, which proved fruitless, for the Tartars quickly overran the very areas Ching had been pacifying, he returned home to the mountain and to his resolute, stubborn associates, regaling them month after month with stories of his campaigns in the north.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will place men here and here,” stout-hearted Ching proposed. He was a courageous man of whom it was said, “He can march forty miles in a day and fight that evening.” He had a broad, resolute face, and in many of the things he did in the years following his impromptu military service he displayed great fortitude, so that although he was clearly a braggart, men did not begrudge him his title of general and listened when he predicted: “The Tartars will approach our village by this route. What other way would a sensible general choose?”</p>

  <p class="normal">But before General Ching’s theories could be tested, an enemy far worse than the Tartars, and far more familiar, descended upon the village. The rains did not fall as required, and a hot sun blazed remorselessly in the copper sky. Seedlings withered before the middle of spring, and by midsummer even drinking water was at a prohibitive premium. Families with old people began to wonder when the ancient fathers and mothers would die, and babies whined.</p>

  <p class="normal">Farmer Char and his wife Nyuk Moi had lived through four famines and they knew that if one practiced a rigid discipline and ate the roots of grass and chewy tendrils dug from the forest, there was always a chance that one’s family would survive. But this year the famine struck with overpowering force, and by midsummer it became apparent that most of the village families must either take to the road or die among the parched and blazing hills. Therefore, when the sun was most intense, Char and his wife fetched mud bricks from the almost vanished village stream and walled up the entrance to their home, placing a cross of black sticks where the door had been. When the house was almost sealed, Char went inside and weighed for the last time the little bag of seed grain upon which life would depend when his family returned next spring. Hefting it in his hand, he assured his miserable group: “The seed grain is now locked inside. It will wait for us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He then climbed out and swiftly closed the opening. When this was done, he turned his back sorrowfully upon his home and led his family out of the walled village and onto the highway. For the next seven months they would roam over the face of China, begging food, eating garbage where there was any, and trying to avoid selling their daughters to old men with food. Twice before, Char and Nyuk Moi had experienced the wandering months and had brought their brood home intact and they felt confident that they could do the same this time, for as they started on the dreadful pilgrimage Char swore hopefully, “In seven months we will be back here … all of us.” But this time Nyuk Moi was not so hopeful, and Char noticed that his wife kept her two pretty daughters close to her, day and night.</p>

  <p class="normal">Concerning only one thing did the Chars have no fear. During their absence their house would be inviolate. Highwaymen might murder them along the road. Slave buyers in cities might try to filch their daughters. Possibly, soldiers would wipe out all the wandering families in a general massacre. And corrupt officials might trick any family into slavery. But no one in China would break into a house that had been sealed with mud and across whose door sticks had been crossed, for even an idiot knew that unless the house was there when the travelers returned, and unless the seed grain was secure, life itself--and not only that of the family in question-- would perish. So while the Chars wandered across northern China, seeking almost hopelessly for food, their house stood sacrosanct.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the autumn of 856 in a city on the northern borders of Hunan, farmer Char was bitterly tempted. There the rains had been good and the crops were fine. For several weeks Char and his family went out to the harvested fields at night and crawled across them, on hands and knees, smelling out lost grains that even the insects had missed, and in this cruel way they had uncovered just enough hidden morsels to stay alive. Nyuk Moi cooked the gleanings with a kind of aerated mud, some grass, and a bird that had not been dead too long. The resulting dish was not too bad.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when a spell of four successive days passed with no gleanings to be found and when no birds died, at least not within reach of the starving family, the servant of a rich man came to the tree where the Chars were sleeping, and he carried in a bag a bundle of freshly baked cakes, whose aroma drove the smaller Char children mad with hunger, for they were the kind of cakes Nyuk Moi had often baked, and the servant said bluntly, “My master would consider buying your oldest daughter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Char, at the point of starvation, found himself asking seriously, “Would he keep her for, his own?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Perhaps for a time,” the servant said, rustling his package. “But sooner or later he sends most of the girls on to the city.” “How much would he give us?” Char asked pitifully. The servant grew expansive and said, “Cakes, enough grain to live on till the spring.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come back in an hour,” Char said, and as the man disappeared, swinging his tempting bundle of aromatic cakes, Char assembled his family, saying frankly, “The owner of the fields has offered to buy Siu Lan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Moi, who had foreseen that this must soon happen, drew her quiet child to her and, placing the girl on the ground between her bony knees, asked, “Is there no other way?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The gleanings are no more,” Char said despondently. “Winter comes soon. This time we’ll be lucky if we get home with any children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Moi did not rail at her husband, for she knew of no alternative to propose, not even one, and the family had about agreed to sell Siu Lan, Beautiful Orchid, when they heard a whistling, and some stranger was whistling a song long familiar in their village and not known much elsewhere. “Who’s out there?” Char cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">The stranger, recognizing his village’s accent, shouted, “General Ching!” And in a moment he hurried up, square-faced, sallow with hunger, but as ebullient as ever. “How goes the famine with you?” he asked boisterously. “With me not so good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Char said sadly and without explanation, “We are meeting to decide about selling our oldest daughter, Siu Lan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d buy her!”&#160; General Ching&#160; cried,&#160; bowing gallantly&#160; to&#160; the frightened girl. “Anybody’d buy her!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The rich man’s servant is coming back within the hour to hear our answer,” Char added.</p>

  <p class="normal">General Ching’s agile mind swept into military action. “Servant? Rich man?” he snapped, his hungry eyes darting about in the darkness. And in an instant he had a complete plot. “We will tell the servant that we will sell the girl. I’m your older brother. I make the decisions. Then you and I and Nyuk Moi and your older boy will deliver her. As soon as the servant gets close enough to the house so that we know where the rich old man lives, we kill him, take everything he has and send the booty back with the boy. We then enter the house, present Siu Lan, and as the rich old man steps forward to take her, we murder him. There may be a fight, so each of you, Char, Nyuk Moi and Siu Lan must be prepared to kill. Siu Lan, do you think you could kill a man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the frail girl said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good,” General Ching said, rubbing his fleshless hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will the plan work?” Char asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If it doesn’t, we will die of starvation anyway,” the general replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If they catch us, what will they do?” the oldest boy asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They will put us in cages,” General Ching explained, “and starve us to death and carry us from village to village so that other starving people will see what happens if farmers kill to get food, and at the end, when they see we are almost dead, they will take us out of the cage and cut us up into three hundred little pieces and hang our heads on the town gate. So, you understand the risks?” he asked coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the Chars replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ssssshhhh,” General Ching whispered. “Here comes the servant.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The man bustled up, officious and well fed, still rustling his bundle of cakes, and said, “Have you made up your minds?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am the older brother,” General Ching announced. “We have discussed it and have agreed to sell.” Whereupon the servant led Siu Lan and her mother Nyuk Moi and the oldest boy and Char and the general back toward’s his master’s house, and when they had gone far enough so that everyone saw clearly how the rich man’s home was laid out, and where the entrances were, the general strangled the servant and threw the cakes to the boy, who ran back with them to the starving children and the old grandmother.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now it takes courage,” Ching said solemnly. He led the way into the rich man’s house, presented Siu Lan, and said, “Master, we have produced the girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is Ping?” the man asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is giving the cakes to the starving children,” square-faced Ching said gently. “Master, have you ever seen your own children starve?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the man swallowed hard, trying not to look at Siu Lan, who was most temptingly beautiful.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have,” Ching said softly. “In this famine I have buried three of my children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Nyuk Moi gasped, and something in the manner by which she betrayed the fact that she did not know of General Ching’s misfortune uncovered the plot to the rich, canny old man, and he tried to pull a bell which would summon servants, but General Ching coldly intervened, grasped the man’s fat arm and bent it backwards.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Three of my children have died,” Ching repeated slowly, “and now you will die.” With tremendous force, he closed his bony hands about the man’s throat and strangled him, but in dying the man who bought girls for the city managed to utter a cry, and a servant rushed in with a weapon, trying to slash at General Ching, but Char leaped upon the man and the weapon fell to the floor, whereupon Nyuk Moi grabbed it and killed the intruder.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the two bodies were kicked into a corner, General Ching said, “I have buried my children, and I have lived on clay, but tonight I am going to feast.” And he ransacked the house, bringing forth all the food and wine he could find. Then he sent Siu Lan to fetch the children, and the feast lasted till midnight, with the general and Char’s old mother singing mountain songs. Then, almost drunk with wine, the general said, “All the time we have been drinking I have been wondering, ‘How can I help Char’s family escape? With six children and a grandmother?’ I’m sure I could manage for myself, but with so many in your family I don’t know what to suggest. Shall we scurry to the city and try to lose ourselves there? Or shall we hide in the hills?”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was then that tough-minded Nyuk Moi proposed: “This is a time of war, and soldiers are everywhere. So I believe that when the authorities discover these deaths they will first cry, ‘Soldiers did this!’ So they will waste valuable time looking for soldiers, and we will march far into the hills. Later, when they change their minds and say, ‘It must have been starving farmers,’ we will be so far away it won’t be worth their while to follow us, for some new battle will engage them. Therefore we must hurry to the hills.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would you feel better if I stayed with you?” General Ching asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course,” Nyuk Moi replied. “You are now our brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But will our plan work,” the general asked, “if we have to take along the old grandmother?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will take her,” Char said firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The general frowned and said, “Well, anyway, I will join you, for this famine has killed my entire family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So the little band struggled back toward the mountains, planning their route so as to arrive home in time for spring planting, but as they approached their walled-in village scarifying news awaited them, for in their absence the Tartars had come and had broken open the inviolate seals and had stolen the seed grain. When Char stood before the sanctuary he had so carefully sealed and saw its shattered door, he experienced a bitterness he had never before known, not even in those moments when he was preparing to sell his daughter. He wanted to fight and slay, and in his anger he cried, “What kind of men are they, that they would break open a sealed house?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Futilely he looked at General Ching, then dashed about the village summoning all the outraged farmers. Pointing at his trusted friend, he cried, “General Ching has shown us how to dispose our men so that when the Tartars come back we can annihilate them. I have found that Ching is a fine military strategist, and I think we had better adopt his plan. Let us kill these damnable barbarians … all of them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">General Ching, quivering with excitement at the prospect of military action, made a great show of assigning his troops to strategic points, but as he did so he heard Nyuk Moi’s cold rational voice asking, “What are we fighting to protect? This village? We have no seed to build this village up again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as the farmers considered this fact, and as they felt hunger come upon them, even in the clement spring, they began to wonder, and at this moment a solitary outpost unit of .the Tartars—two brutal men in furs and on big horses—swept into the village, rode briskly about, and reined up before Char’s house. The men were so obviously conquerors that General Ching’s bold strategies were not even attempted, and the villagers listened as the invaders shouted in barbarous Chinese, “You have three days to abandon this village. All men above the age of fifteen will join the army. Women may go where they like.” The men pulled back on their horses, wheeled madly in the dust, and rode off.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night General Ching proposed his plan. “When I was in the army I heard of a place they call the Golden Valley. In the morning we start marching there, and everyone who can walk will accompany us. For here there is no hope.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Char asked, “What do you mean, everyone who can walk?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And Ching replied, “The old folks will have to stay behind. They cannot encumber us on the road.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Families looked in apprehension at their older members and a mournful silence fell across the village, so that General Ching was forced to move from family to family, saying bluntly, like a soldier, “Old man, you cannot come with us. Old woman, you have seen your life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he reached Char’s family he pointed directly at Char’s mother and said harshly, “Old woman, you were brave the night we murdered the rich man, so you will understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Char remonstrated, “General, it is not within our religion to abandon a mother. Confucius is strict in this regard: ‘Honor thy parents.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are going on a long journey, Char. Maybe a thousand miles over mountains and rivers. The old cannot come with us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the frightened men of the village edged into the conversation and asked, “Have you ever been to what you call the Golden Valley?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,”&#160; Ching replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you sure it is where you say?” the man continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, I have only heard tales about it … while I was in the army. Good land. Gentle rivers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think we can get there from here?” the doubtful one asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">General Ching grew impatient and pulled up his rags so that he looked more like a soldier. “I don’t know the pathway, or whether we will be accepted when we get there. I don’t know how long the journey will take. But by the demons of hell I know that I do not want to live any longer in a land where men break into sealed houses and where you starve three years in every ten.” Suddenly sweeping his arms to include all the village, he stormed: “I don’t know where we’re going, but Siu Lan is going with me, and the rest of you can rot in hell.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Quickly he wheeled about and faced Siu Lan, the girl he had rescued from the old man, and he bowed before her as a proper general would, and said softly, “May the felicitations of a thousand years rest upon you.” Then he turned gravely to Char and explained: “Old friend, I am not pleased to marry your beautiful daughter in this rude and uncivil way. I would like to send you a thousand cakes and a hundred pigs and barrels of wine. I would like to dress her in brocades from Peking and send a horse for her and musicians. But, Brother Char, we are starving to death and I at least am going south. Forgive me for my rudeness.” He then faced Nyuk Moi and said gallantly, “Char’s wife, let us make believe the famine is not upon us. I shall go to my house for the last time and wait there in the darkness. Will you consent, please, to bring your daughter to me in formal style?” He bowed low and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">Farmer Char organized the marriage procession, and from the low stone houses streamed out the old people who had been condemned to stay behind, and they marched behind the bride, and one man played a flute, but there were no gifts and no brocades. At the door of General Ching’s house, where there had once been many children, Char knocked twice and cried, “Awake! Awake! It is dawn, and we bring your bride!” It was nearly midnight, of course, and when the general appeared he was dressed in rags, but he had seen proper weddings and he bowed gravely to Siu Lan, and the flute played madly, and everyone pretended to exchange the customary gifts, and the general took his bride.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn next morning, in the spring of 857, Char, then forty-four years old, assembled his family and said to them, “On our journey we must listen to General Ching, for he is a sensible man, and if we have any hopes of reaching a better land, it will be because of his genius. Therefore we must obey him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the rude army mustered, the Chars were first in line, followed by two hundred starving men and women ready to follow General Ching on the exodus south, but when it came time to bid farewell to this parched and inhospitable combination of rock and reluctant soil, the women in the procession could not control their tears. There was the memorable rock where the farmer Moo, a man much set upon by fate, had finally killed his wife. Here was the tree where the soldiers had hanged the bandit who had stayed hidden by the village for six weeks. There was the house where babies were born. It was a lucky house, that one, perpetually filled with children. And outside the village walls stood the fields where men and women toiled. How sweet this village had been. If there was food, all shared. If there was none, all starved together, and women wept at the memory of those days, now gone forever.</p>

  <p class="normal">But there were certain houses at which not even the reminiscing women dared look, for they held the old people, and one house held not only two old women but also a baby that could not be expected to live; out of respect for the feelings of the departing army the old people remained hidden inside. They would stay in the village awhile. The Tartars would abuse them, and they would die.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the entire army only one person dared look at the houses where the old people were left, and that was General Ching. He was not really a military man, in the honest sense of the word, but he had seen a great deal of fighting and much killing, and now as he stood at the village gateway, he was not ashamed to look back at the living tombs, for they held men and women who had been kind to him in days past. One old woman had given him her daughter, the mother of the three children who had starved to death, and for these patient old people he felt a compassion wider than the plains of China.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly he raised his arms to the cloudless spring heavens and shouted, “Old people inside the walls! Die in peace! Be content that your children shall find a better home! Die in peace, you fine old people!” And biting his lips he led his band down onto the plains.</p>

  <p class="normal">But they had gone only a few miles when by prearrangement, from behind a rock on the trail, stepped forth Char’s old mother, and Char announced firmly, “I have told her that she can come with us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">General&#160; Ching rushed up and&#160; thrashed his&#160; hands in&#160; the air, screaming, “This isn’t military! She has got to stay with the others.” Char&#160; looked&#160; at&#160; the&#160; general&#160; coldly&#160; and&#160; said,&#160;&#160; “Who&#160; hid&#160; you in the fields after our triple murder? Who had courage that night?” “Don’t speak to me of murders!” Ching roared. “You are murdering the chances of the entire army.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who ever said that you were a general to lead an army?” Char shouted, and the two men, almost too weak to march, began fighting, but their blows were so weak that neither damaged the other, so that soon Nyuk Moi had pulled off her husband Char, and Siu Lan had pacified her new husband, the general.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother Char,” the general said patiently between gasps, “from the beginning of history there have been soldiers, and soldiers have rules.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“General Ching,” Char replied, “from the beginning of history there have been mothers, and mothers have sons.” These simple words were to live in Chinese history as the filial words of Char the farmer, but at the moment they did not much impress General Ching.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She cannot come with us,” he commanded icily. “She is my mother,” Char argued stubbornly. “Does not the old man Lao-tse tell us that a man must live in harmony with&#160; the universe, that he must give loyalty to his parents even before his wife?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not even a mother can be allowed to imperil our march,” General Ching responded. “She will stay here!” he cried dramatically, pointing to the rocks behind which she had been hidden.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then I shall stay with her,” Char said simply, and he seated his old mother on a large rock and sat beside her. To his wife and five children he said, “You must go on,” and the assembly began to disappear in the distant dust, so that Char’s mother said, “Faithful son, the other old people were left behind. It is only right that I too should stay. Hurry, catch up with Nyuk Moi.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We shall stay here and fight the Tartars,” Char said stubbornly, but as he sat he saw a figure running back from the disappearing mob, and it was General Ching.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Char,” he said, in surrender, “we cannot go without you. You are a stalwart man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will rejoin you, with my mother,” Char replied. “You may bring her,” General Ching consented. “She will represent all of our mothers.” Then he added, “But I will not accept you, Char, unless you apologize to the entire body for having made fun of me as a soldier.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will apologize,” Char agreed. “Not from shame, but because you really are a very fine soldier.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then General Ching said to the old woman, “Of course you know that you will not live to see the new land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If a journey is long enough, everyone must die along the way,’ the old woman replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">As <span>GENERAL</span> CHiNG’s resolute group moved south from Hunan Province they acquired people from more than a hundred additional villages whose sturdy peasants, like Ching’s, refused to accept Tartar domination. In time, what had started as a rabble became in actuality a solid army, with General Ching courageously willing to forge ahead in any risks while his lieutenant, General Char, guarded the rear and fought off bandits and stray bands of Tartars who sought to prevent the exodus.</p>

  <p class="normal">Across great mountain ranges the travelers moved, down swollen rivers and past burned villages. Winter came and deep snows, summer and the blazing heat of central China. At times General Ching was forced to lay siege to large cities, until food was given, and had China been at peace, imperial troops would undoubtedly have cut the marauders to shreds and crucified the leaders, but China was not at peace, and the great trek continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">Years passed, and the stolid, resolute men of Hunan struggled southward, a few miles a day. Sometimes they bogged down at a river bank for two or three months. The siege of a city might delay them for a year. They ate, no one knew how. They stole from all. In the high mountain passes in winter their feet, wrapped in bags, left bloody trails, but everyone was constantly on the alert to fight. More than a thousand children were born, and even they fell under the simple rules of General Ching: “No old people can join us. You must submit to the government of Ching and Char. We never break into a sealed house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was only one element in the army that successfully defied General Ching, and that was Char’s old mother. Like a resilient field hoe whose suppleness increases with age, the wiry old woman thrived on the long march. If there was plenty of food, she was able to gorge herself without the stomach sickness that assaulted the others at such a time; and if there was starvation ahead, she apparently had some inner source of strength that carried her along. General Ching used to look at her and swear, “By the fires of hell, old woman, I think you were sent to torment me. Aren’t you ever going to die?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mountains and rivers are like milk to me,” she replied. And she became the symbol of the group: an indomitable old woman who had known starvation and murder and change. She refused to be carried, and often when her son, General Char, rejoined the group after some rear-guard action against local troops who were trying to disperse the army, he would throw his sword upon the ground and lie exhausted beside his mother, and she would say, “My years cannot go on forever, but I am sure that you and I will see a good land before I die.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The years passed, and this curious, undigested body of stalwart Chinese, holding to old customs and disciplined as no other that had ever wandered across China, probed constantly southward, until in the year 874 they entered upon a valley in Kwangtung Province, west of the city of Canton. It had a clear, swift-running river, fine mountains to the rear, and soil that seemed ripe for intensive cultivation. “I think this is what we have been looking for,” General Ching said as his minions stared down at the rich promise below them. “This is the Golden Valley.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He held a consultation with General Char and his lieutenants, and then called in Char’s fantastically old mother. “What do you think?” he asked her solemnly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“From what I can see, it looks good,” she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">The general rose, cupped his hands, and faced north. “You old people, dead back there in the walled village!” he shouted. “Your children have found their new home.” Then he glared at Char’s mother and said, “You can die now. It is really outrageous how long you have lived.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The occupation of the valley was not so simple a task as General Ching and his advisers had hoped, for the river bed was occupied by a capable, fiercely compact group of southerners whom Ching and his cohorts held to be not Chinese at all, for they spoke a different language, ate different food, dressed differently, followed different customs and hated above all else the old-style Chinese from the north. At first, Ching attempted to settle the problem directly, by driving the southerners out, but their troops were as well trained as his, so his army had little success. Next, he tried negotiation, but the southerners were more clever than he and tricked him into surrendering what advantages he had already gained. Finally, when military occupation of the entire valley proved unfeasible, the general decided to leave the lowlands to the southerners and to occupy all the highlands with his people, and in time the Highlanders became known as the Hakka, the Guest People, while the lowlanders were called the Punti, the Natives of the Land.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in this manner that one of the strangest anomalies of history developed, for during a period of almost a thousand years these two contrasting bodies of people lived side by side with practically no friendly contact. The Hakka lived in the highlands and farmed; the Punti lived in the lowlands and established an urban life. From their walled villages the Hakka went into the forests to gather wood, which their women lugged down onto the plains in bundles; the Punti sold pigs. The Hakka mixed sweet potatoes with their rice; the Punti, more affluent, ate theirs white. The Hakka built their homes in the U formation of the north; the Punti did not. The Hakka remained a proud, fierce, aloof race of people, Chinese to the core and steeped in Chinese lore; the Punti were relaxed southerners, and when the lords of China messed up the government so that no decent man could tell which end of the buffalo went forward, the Punti shrugged their shoulders and thought: “The north was always like that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In addition to all these obvious differences, there were two of such gravity that it could honestly be said, “No Punti can ever comprehend a Hakka, and no Hakka cares whether he does or not.” The upland people, the Hakka, preserved intact their ancient speech habits inherited from the purest fountain of Chinese culture, whereas the Punti had a more amiable, adjustable language developed during two thousand years spent far outside the influence of Peking. No Punti could understand what a Hakka said; no Hakka gave a damn about what a Punti said. In certain pairs of villages, they lived within three miles of each other for ten centuries, but Hakka never spoke to Punti, not only because of inherited hatreds, but because neither could converse in the other’s language.</p>

  <p class="normal">The second difference, however, was perhaps even more divisive, for when the outside conquerors of China decreed that all gentlewomen, out of respect for their exalted position, must bind their feet and hobble about like ladies on cruel and painful stumps, the Punti willingly kowtowed to the command, and Punti villages were marked by handsome, well-dressed wives who sat through long years of idleness, the throbbing pain in their feet only a distant memory. In this respect, the Punti village became a true portrait of all of China.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the self-reliant Hakka women refused to bind the feet of their girl babies, and once when a general of the imperial army strode into the High Village and commanded that henceforth all Hakka women must have small feet, the Hakka began to laugh at his folly, and they continued to ridicule the idea until the general retreated in confusion. When he returned with a company of troops to hang everyone, the Hakka women fled to the mountains and were not caught. In their resolve to be free they were fortified by their memories of three resolute ancestors: General Char’s old mother, who had lived to be eighty-two and who survived the long trek south in better shape than most of the men; her practical daughter-in-law Nyuk Moi, who had ruled the Golden Valley for a decade after her husband’s death; and the gentle, iron-willed Siu Lan, the learned widow of General Ching, who ruled the area for another decade after Nyuk Moi’s death. They were revered as the ideal prototypes of Hakka womanhood, and for anyone to think of them marching with bound feet was ridiculous. Furthermore, as Ching the seer prudently pointed out in 1670: “If our women bind their feet, how can they work?” So the Hakka women laughed at the government edicts and remained free. Of course, the Punti ridiculed them, and on those rare occasions when a Hakka woman wandered into Canton, the city people stared, but these resolute, difficult, obstinate guests from the north refused to be dictated to.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course, not all of General Ching’s army settled in the Golden Valley, but all the Chars and the Chings did, and they built on the sides of the mountain a group of U-shaped low houses inside a mud wall, and this came to be known as the High Village; whereas the village along the river bank, in which the Punti lived, was always known as the Low Village; and in the two, certain sayings became common. When Punti children played, they taunted their fellows: “Quack like a duck and talk like a Hakka,” but in the High Village people frequently cried, with adequate facial gestures: “I am not afraid of heaven. I’m not afraid of earth. But the thing I do fear is listening to a Punti trying to speak Mandarin.” There were other folk sayings in the two villages that got closer to the fundamental differences between Hakka and Punti; for in the High Village, Hakka mothers would warn their daughters: “You continue as lazy as you are, and we’ll bind your feet and make you a Punti.” But in the Low Village, Punti mothers threatened their sons: “One more word out of you, and I’ll marry you to a Hakka girl.” This latter was held to be a rather dreadful prospect, for Hakka girls were known to make powerful, strong-willed, intelligent wives who demanded an equal voice in family matters, and no sensible man wanted a wife like that.</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Village and the Low Village had only one thing in common. At periodic intervals, each was visited by disaster. In some ways the perils of the Low Village were the more conspicuous, for when the great river rose in flood, as it did at least once every ten years, it burst forth from its banks with a sullen violence and engulfed the farmlands. It surged across fields of rice, swept away cattle, crept high up the walls of the village houses, and left a starving people. Worse, it threw sand across the fields, so that subsequent crops were diminished, and in the two years after a flood, it was known that one lowland person in four was sure to perish either from starvation or from plague.</p>

  <p class="normal">What the Hakka, looking down on this recurring disaster, could never understand was this. In the year 1114, with the aid of nearly sixty thousand people, Hakka and Punti alike, the government built a great spillway which started above the Low Village and which was intended to divert the flood waters away from that village and many others, and the idea was a capital one and would have saved many lives, except that greedy officials, seeing much inviting land in the bottom of the dry channel and along it sides, reasoned: “Why should we leave such fine silted soil lying idle? Let us plant crops in the channel, because in nine average years out of ten, there is no flood and we will make a lot of money. Then, in the tenth year, we lose our crops, but we will already have made a fortune and we can bear the loss.” But over a period of seven hundred years the Hakka noticed that the escape channel for the river was never once used, and for this reason: “We can see there is going to be a flood,” the officials argued, “and a great many people are bound to be killed. But if we open the floodgates to save the villages, our crops in the channel will be destroyed. Now let’s be sensible. Why should we allow the waters to wash away our crops in the one year when we will be able to charge highest prices for them?” So the gates remained closed, and to protect one thirtieth of one per cent of the land around the villages, all the rest was laid waste. Flood after flood after flood swept down, and not once were the gates opened to save the people. The backbreaking work of sixty thousand peasants was used solely to protect the crops of a few already rich government officials, whose profits quadrupled when the countryside was starving. This the Hakka could never comprehend. “It is the way of China,” Ching the seer explained, “but if it were Hakka fields being destroyed, I am sure we would kill the officials and break down the floodgates.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Punti, on the other hand, were unable to understand Hakka behavior when drought struck the High Village. One Punti woman told her children, “There is no sensible way of explaining a people who wall up their houses with mud, place crossed sticks before the door, and then wander about the countryside for six months eating roots and clay.” The Punti did learn one thing about the Hakka, however, and that was never to touch the walled-up houses or disturb the seed grain. During the great famine of 911 a body of Punti had invaded the deserted High Village and had carried away the seed grain, but there was much death when the theft was discovered, and this did not happen again.</p>

  <p class="normal">For eight hundred years following the settlement in 874, the Hakka and the Punti lived side by side in these two starving villages --as they did throughout much of southern China--without a single man from the High Village ever marrying a woman from the Low Village. And certainly no marriage could be contracted the other way around, for no Low Village man would want to marry a woman with big feet. When it came time for a man in the High Village to marry, he faced something of a problem, for everyone in his community was named either Char or Ching, after the two famous generals who had led the Hakka south, and to contract a marriage within such close relationships would have been incestuous; the Chinese knew that to keep a village strong required the constant importation of new wives from outside. So in late autumn, when the fields were tended and time was free, missions would set out from the High Village to trek across the mountains to some neighboring Hakka village twenty miles away, and there would be a good deal of study and discussion and argument and even downright trading, but the upshot always was that the High Village committee came home with a pretty fair bundle of brides. Of course, at the same time missions from other Hakka villages were visiting the High Village to look over its women, and in this way the Hakka blood was kept strong. Two additional rules were followed: no man could marry into a family into which his ancestors had married until five generations had elapsed; and no girl was accepted as a potential bride unless her horoscope assured a bountiful relationship with her proposed husband.</p>

  <p class="normal">By these means the Hakka perfected one of the most rigid and binding family systems in China. Pestilence, war, floods and Punti threatened the group, but the family continued, and every child was proudly taught the filial words of Char the farmer: “From the beginning of history there have been mothers, and mothers have sons.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1693 a Punti man of no standing whatever ran away with a Hakka woman, the first such marriage ever recorded in the Golden Valley, and a brawl started which lasted more than forty years. No similar marriages were attempted, but serious fighting between the Hakka and the Punti erupted on many occasions, and during one terrible campaign which involved a good deal of southern China, more than one hundred thousand people were massacred in scenes of horror which dug one more unbridgeable gulf between the two peoples. In surliness, in misunderstanding and in fear the two groups lived side by side, and no one in the area thought their enmity strange. As Ching the seer pointed out: “From the beginning of history, people who are not alike have hated one another.” In the Low Village the sages often explained the bitterness by asking, “Do the dog and the tiger mate?” Of course, when they asked this question, they threw out their chests a little at the word tiger so that no one could misunderstand as to who the dogs were.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THE YEAR</span> 1847, when young Reverend Micah Hale was preaching in Connecticut—the same year in which Dr. John Whipple sailed to Valparaiso to study the export of hides—Char, the headman of the High Village, had a daughter to whom he gave a name of particular beauty: Char Nyuk Tsin, Char Perfect Jade, and it was this girl’s destiny to grow up in the two decades when Hakka fortunes degenerated in scenes of great violence. Nyuk Tsin was not a tall child, nor was she alluring, but she had strong feet, capable hands and fine teeth. Her hair was not plentiful, and this bothered her, so that her mother had several times to reprimand her, saying, “Nyuk Tsin, it doesn’t matter how you dress your hair. You haven’t very much, so accept the fact.” But what the little girl lacked in adornment, she made up in quick intelligence. Her father had to tell her only once the famous saying of the Char family: “From the beginning of history there have been mothers, and mothers have sons.” When Char spoke of family loyalty, the conspicuous virtue of the Hakka, his daughter understood.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was therefore distressed when many people in the High Village began to whisper that headman Char had gotten into serious trouble and had run away. She could not believe that her father had the capacity to be evil, but sure enough, in due time, soldiers invaded the High Village and announced: “We are searching for the headman Char. He has joined the Taiping Rebellion, and if he dares to come back to the village, you must kill him.” The men kicked Nyuk Tsin’s mother several times and one of them jabbed a gun into the girl’s stomach, growling, “Your father is a murderer, and next time we come back it’s you we’re going to shoot.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was six that year, 1853, and she saw her father only once thereafter. Well, that is not entirely correct, but let us grant for the present that she saw him only once, for he did return to the High Village late one night and mysteriously. The first thing he did was embrace his skinny little girl and tell her, “Ah, Jade, your father has seen things he never dreamed of before. Horses of his own! I captured an entire Punti city . . . not a village like that one down there. Jade, they all bowed as I came in. Low, girl. Like this!” Later he embraced her as if she were his beloved and not his eight-year-old daughter, and he took her with him to watch his Hakka friends enlist in his great venture. Pointing at the frightened would-be soldiers, he said, “To begin with, all soldiers are afraid, Nyuk Tsin. Me? I trembled like a bird gathering seeds. But the important thing is to have loyalty in your heart. When General Lai tells me, ‘General Char, occupy that city!’ do you suppose I stop to question, ‘Now what is General Lai up to?’ No, indeed. I occupy the city, and if I have to kill fifty thousand enemy to do it, I kill them. Jade,” he cried warmly in the mountain darkness, “we are headed far north. I may never see you again.” He swept the quiet girl into his arms and held her close to him. “Take care of your mother,” he said, and the men dashed down the mountainside after him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin did see her father again. In 1863, when she was a thin, extremely well-organized girl of sixteen, capable of bearing huge loads of wood and of caring for her mother and the rest of her family, General Wang of the imperial forces marched into the High Village and commanded his drummer to roll the drum a long time, so that all the villagers assembled. Then, with the aid of an interpreter, for such a general would never know how to speak Hakka, he ordered a herald bearing a black object to read an official announcement.</p>

  <p class="normal">The man kept the black object in his left hand, stepped forward and read in a high nasal voice: “The Taiping rebel chief named Char, who was captured at Nanking and brought under guard to Peking, having confessed that he was a fellow conspirator with Lai Siu Tsuen, who himself has falsely assumed the title of General of the North, was tried and put to death last month by being slowly cut into three hundred small pieces over a period of nine hours, according to just law, and his head was exposed at the city for three days as a warning to all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Having said this, the herald passed the decree to another, and with his free hand drew away the black covering, disclosing in a wire cage the head of General Char. Ants had gotten to it, and flies, so that the eyeballs were gone and the tongue, but the dedicated man’s features were clear, and the head was fixed to a pole in the middle of the village, after which General Wang announced sternly: “This is what happens to traitors!” Then he demanded: “Where is the widow of the traitor Char?” The villagers refused to identify the wife of their great leader, but Nyuk Tsin’s mother put her children aside and announced proudly, “I am his wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shoot her,” General Wang said, and she fell into the village dust.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later the High Village remembered sardonically General Wang’s platitudes about traitors, for it was hardly less than two weeks after his brave appearance in their village that he studied the various opportunities confronting him and decided to become a traitor himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">The year 1864 was therefore a truly terrible one in the Golden Valley, for half the time General Wang was rampaging through the villages seeking loot, while during the other half government troops were in pursuit of the traitor. Wang, having discovered the High Village, rarely passed it by, and in time even enlisted a good many Hakka into his band. This gave the government troops title to whatever they could find in the High Village, and they often shot Hakka farmers for the fun of it. Nyuk Tsin, by virtue of not looking too pretty and of working long hours hauling wood to the lowlands, which made her seem much older than she was, escaped rape, but many of the other Hakka girls did not.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this time Nyuk Tsin was living meagerly in the home of her uncle, who, following the execution of her father and mother, was required by village custom to take her in. This uncle, a hard, unhappy one, reminded her constantly of two dismal facts: she was already seventeen years old and unmarried; and because she was her rebellious father’s daughter the soldiers might at any time return to the High Village and shoot both her and her uncle. These two conditions were cause enough for her uncle to cut down on her food rations and increase the bundle of wood she was required to lug down onto the plain.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was not married because of a most unfortunate event over which she had no control. Her horoscope, which had been carefully cast when envoys from a distant Hakka village came seeking wives for the Lai family, showed the thin girl to be doubly cursed: she was born under the influence of the horse and was therefore a headstrong, evil prospect as a wife; and she was clearly a husband-killer, so that only a foolish man would take her into his home. There were, of course, favorable aspects to her future, such as a promise of wealth and many descendants, and these might have encouraged an avaricious husband to discount the peril, except that her horoscope divulged an additional disgrace: she would die in a foreign land. Adding together her willfulness, her husband-killing propensity and her burial in alien soil, the Hakka of the High Village knew that in Char Nyuk Tsin they had an unmarriageable girl, and after a while they stopped proposing her to visiting envoys.</p>

  <p class="normal">She therefore worked her life away in the near-starving village. She had two items of clothing: a dark-blue cotton smock and a pair of dirty cotton trousers to match. She also had a conical wicker hat, which she tied under her chin with a length of blue cord, and big strong feet for climbing down to the valley with huge burdens of wood; as far as she could see into the future, this was going to be her life. And then, on the festive night before the holiday of Ching Ming, when the Low Village required extra firewood for the great celebrations that were in progress, Nyuk Tsin left the High Village at dusk and started down the steep trail. She had barely reached the plain when a group of four men sprang at her from behind rocks, scattered the wood, slipped a gag into her mouth, jammed a bag over her head, and kidnapped her. When day broke, and her uncle found that she had not returned, he uttered a brief prayer that something permanent had happened to her, and it had. She was never again seen in the High Village.</p>

  <p class="normal">It must not be assumed that during these troubled times the Punti fared any better than the Hakka. In fact, since the traitorous troops of General Wang disliked climbing mountains, there was a good deal more raping and kidnapping in the Low Village than in the High; but this was halted whenever the wild river went into its periodic flood and starvation threatened to wipe out the village completely.</p>

  <p class="normal">These were bad years, but they were terminated in early 1865 by the arrival in the Low Village of a man reputed to be fantastically rich, and within six weeks this amazing Punti had broken open the floodgates so that the river was diverted and the village spared, had bought off the traitor General Wang and then betrayed him to government forces, and had made the village not only secure but happy. The man who accomplished these miracles was a wiry, clever Punti, Kee Chun Fat, whose name meant Spring Prosperity and who had been born fifty-two years earlier right there in the Low Village. In 1846 he had emigrated to California, where he had worked in the gold fields, acquiring the eleven thousand dollars which made him, according to Low Village standards, one of the richest men in the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he moved about the village, making many decisions regarding the extensive Kee family of which he was now the effective if not titular head, he wore a long pigtail, a black skullcap edged in blue satin, a gray silken coatlike garment that fell to his ankles and was tightly buttoned at the neck and heavy brocaded shoes. His lean frame kept him from making an imposing, patriarchal figure, but his evocation of energy made him the unquestioned dictator of the village. In California he had learned to read English but not Chinese, and he could figure percentages, so that as soon as he unpacked he started lending money to his relatives at forty per cent interest per year.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Kee family asked admiringly, “How could a man like you, who is not a soldier at all, be so brave as to argue with General Wang?” he laughed slyly and explained, “When you’ve had to live by outsmarting Americans, it’s very easy to manage a fool like General Wang.” Of course, this answer was meaningless to the Punti, so they said, “We still don’t understand how you did it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kee Chun Fat had an explanation for everything, so he replied, “In Peking a man is emperor, but I have found that in the world money is emperor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you give General Wang money?” the villagers pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I gave him enough to keep him hanging around,” Uncle Chun Fat explained. “Then I told the government troops where he was, and promised them money if they would hang him, and they did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was much discussion among the Kee family as to how Uncle Chun Fat had made his great fortune in America, and one had only to pose the question for the head of the family to explain: “America has gold fields where money is easily made. There are gangs of men laying telegraph wires, and money is easy there, too. But where do you suppose the money is easiest of all? Where they’re building railroads. Tell me, do you think that I brought home with me only the money you have seen here in the Low Village? Oh no, my good friends! I made that much in the gold fields in one year. Washing for the miners. Cooking food. My real money is in an English bank in Hong Kong.” And he produced a book to prove it but only he could read the writing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat’s stories of America were tantalizing. Once he said, “The best part of California is not the money but the women. A man can have three Indian wives and any number of Mexicans. But not at the same time.” Young men with their lips watering asked more about this, but Uncle Chun Fat has already passed on to other matters. “What I would like to do,” he explained to his assembled family, “is to restore the ancestral hall until it is known as the finest in China. We will do honor to our great ancestor, Prince Kee Tse of the Hsiang Dynasty, from whom we are sprung.” As he said these words he recalled the illustrious prince who had invaded Korea nearly three thousand years before, and he told his clan, “It is strange to live in America, where most men do not even know who their grandfathers were. We shall make the name of Prince Kee renowned once more throughout China.” Chun Fat had an older brother who had never amounted to much; nevertheless this Kee Chun Kong was still nominal head of the family, and Chun Fat was careful not to usurp any of his moral prerogatives. But time was short, and in practical matters the energetic Californian had to make one swift decision after another, for which he was forgiven in view of the fact that he was paying for everything. Therefore, as the yearly festival of Ching Ming approached, when honorable- men pay obeisance to their ancestors, he dispatched runners with this command: “All members of the Kee family shall return to the ancestral hall to celebrate Ching Ming.” He then spent nearly a thousand dollars beautifying the low tile-roofed building which was the spiritual focus of the Kee clan.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of his messengers traveled as far south as the evil little Portuguese city of Macao, across the bay from Hong Kong, and there in the Brothel of Spring Nights he delivered his command to a handsome, sharp-eyed young man who cooked for the brothel and helped in other ways. Kee Mun Ki was twenty-two at the time, a clever opportunist, with a brisk pigtail, quick gambler’s hands and an ingratiating smile. His father, hoping that his son would mature into a solid, gifted scholar, had named him Pervading Foundation, but he had wandered from academic pursuits, finding himself skilled at luring young girls into the brothel and in gambling with European sailors who frequented Macao. When the messenger from the Low Village arrived, young Mun Ki was in the midst of an impressive winning streak and showed no intention of leaving the Portuguese city. “Tell my father,” he explained, “that this year I must miss the feast of Ching Ming. Ask him to offer prayers to our ancestors on my behalf.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was not your father who sent for you,” the runner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he dead?” the young gambler asked in apprehension.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, he’s well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Relieved, Mun Ki asked, “Then who presumes to send for me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your uncle, Chun Fat,” the messenger explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">The young brothel assistant could not remember his uncle, who had left the Punti village when Mun Ki was only three, so again he dismissed the command. “I can’t return this year,” he explained. “Business is good here in Macao.” He pointed to the freshly painted brothel and to the red dragons on the gambling hall nearby.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the messenger delivered the striking news that was to modify the young pimp’s life. He said, “Uncle Chun Fat has come back to our village with several million American dollars.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s rich?” the adroit young nephew asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s very rich!” the messenger replied in an awe-filled voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’d better leave at once,” Mun Ki said forcefully. He went in to see the brothel keeper and reported, “My father summons me home to the Low Village.” That sounded impressive.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you must go,” piously replied the Punti who ran the house. ‘Children must honor their parents. But if you find any extra girls in the village, bring them back. We can always use extra Punti.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Mun Ki and the messenger hiked along the river bank to their village, the soft airs of spring brushed over them, and they were deeply moved by the sight of rice fields just bursting into a limpid green; but when they came within sight of home, they saw the bright red paint that had been lavished on the ancestral hall, and Mun Ki whistled: “Oooooh, he must be very rich,” and he hurried home to report to his uncle on the Eve of Ching Ming.</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat was thoroughly impressed by his nephew, for he recognized in Mun Ki his own quick shrewdness. “How is work in the brothel?” he inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good,” his nephew dutifully replied. “You can always steal a little something from the Europeans. But I make most of my money gambling with the sailors.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat studied the boy’s hands and said, “You ought to go to America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could I prosper there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Prosper! My dear nephew, any Punti who cannot make his way in America must be very stupid indeed.” Encouraged by the boy’s attentiveness, Chun Fat expatiated upon his favorite theme: “Ifs ridiculously easy to make a fortune in America if you remember two things. Americans understand absolutely nothing about Chinese, yet they have remarkably firm convictions about us, and to prosper you must never disappoint them. Unfortunately, their convictions are contrary, so that it is not always easy to be a Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t understand what you are saying,” Kee Mun Ki interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will in a moment,” his uncle replied. “First, the Americans are convinced that all Chinese are very stupid, so you must seem to be stupid. Second, they are also convinced that we are very clever. So you must seem to be clever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can a man be stupid and clever at the same time?” the young pimp pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t say you were to be stupid and clever. I said you had to seem to be.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How is that possible?” the handsome young gambler inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I left America with forty-one thousand dollars in gold because I discovered the answer,” Uncle Chun Fat gloated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For example?” the student pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Take the gold fields,” the Californian began. “For two years they watched me travel from camp to camp, observing everything. But they thought: ‘He’s a stupid Chinaman and he don’t see anything.’ And I will confess I did my best to look stupid. When I had learned as much as possible, I went into San Francisco . . . Mun Ki, when you do go to America, be sure to go to San Francisco. What a marvelous city! So much happening!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where did the clever part come, Uncle? the young man interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Chun Fat liked the boy’s attention to detail, and continued: “In San Francisco I went to all the newcomers and told them, ‘I can tell you which land to buy,’ and they always said to one another, “These Chinese are very clever. If anybody knows where the good land is, they do.’ And I got rich.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Stupid and clever,” the young man mused. “That’s difficult.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not necessarily,” his uncle corrected. “You see, the Americans want to believe, so you don’t have to work too hard. It’s difficult only when you want to convince the same man, on the same day or even at the same instant, that you are both stupid and clever. Like on the railroad gang.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What happened there?” Mun Ki inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">His uncle began to laugh heartily and said, “There was this big American boss. When you go to America, Mun Ki, never try to be the boss, not even if they ask you to, which they won’t, because you can always make more money by not being the boss. Well, anyway, if I wanted to run the restaurant for the gang, at my own prices, I had to get permission from this big American, and I simply could do nothing with him until on a certain day when he cried in desperation, ‘You stupid goddamned Chinaman!’ And then I knew things would pretty soon be going my way, because if you can get the boss to yell at you, ‘You stupid goddamned Chinaman,’ everything is going to be all right.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat never finished this particular narrative because he was reminded that the household must rise next morning at cockcrow in order to pay proper respect to the dead; and as the village lay sleeping beside the river, with the ghosts of its ancestors ready to assume their positions for the day of celebration, an old watchman who had long performed this ceremony gathered his gong and beater and waited till the third hour of the night. Then, as the first cock crowed, the old man went out into the dark streets and began beating his gong.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ching Ming!” he called to the living and the dead alike. Walking down the winding road that led to the ancestral hall, he continued to beat his gong, and he saw with pleasure lights coming on in the low houses; a young attendant hastened to light torches at the hall, and before the first shimmering darts of sunrise began to sweep in from the east, the Low Village was awake, and Mun Ki’s ineffective father took his position of superiority at the ancestral hall, but it was brash Uncle Chun Fat who hurried busily about, telling the Kees what he wanted them to do.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kee Mun Ki, from the brothel in Macao, left his home and walked solemnly to the hall, where a flight of nine scrubbed steps led to the pavilion in which the ancestral tablets were kept. Here he deposited his gifts and made obeisance to those from whom his family honor had descended. He then left the pavilion and joined the members of his family, standing at attention while his father prayed and while his uncle began a bombastic speech: “I am going to buy land on this side, and some more on this side, and what you have seen so far is really nothing. There will be a spacious hall, and where our tablets now stand, we will have not wood but the finest stone. The Kees will be known for their magnificence.” And then his crafty eyes fell upon the extensive family gathered before him and he sighed to himself: “All those poor idiots starving here year after year when they could be making their fortunes in America.” But he knew from experience that the Kees were not the kind of people who would venture forth to unknown lands, and he became lost in admiration of himself for having had the courage to do so.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was therefore in a receptive frame of mind when a surprising event occurred in the Golden Valley, one totally without precedent.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was on April 19, 1865, when the fields were beginning to recover from the flood, that a merchant from Canton appeared in the Low Village, leading an American. Normally, any stranger who had wandered from the quays of Canton would have been executed, but this man was different, for as a scholar he had requested freedom to travel inland, and it had been granted, so that now he stood in the bright spring sunlight, looking with an appreciative eye upon the strange world thus uncovered to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took the Cantonese merchant about four seconds to recognize that in this village Uncle Chun Fat was the man to deal with, so he said directly, “The stranger has come all the way from the Fragrant Tree Country to hire people to work in the sugar fields.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Chun Fat stood enraptured, and his mind leaped back to that memorable day when his ship had stopped in Honolulu and he had been allowed to come on deck to see the great green hills behind the city. How marvelously beautiful those few hours had been, for storms had swept down from the heights and Chun Fat had watched the copious rain spread out like a blanket of benevolence over the rich land. “The Fragrant Tree Country!” he cried. “To go there would be like going to heaven itself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Excited with a wild joy he ran into his house and reappeared with a sandalwood box which he had purchased in Canton for the preservation of his silks, and he passed it around his family, explaining: “Smell it! In the country of which he speaks the air is like this twenty-four hours a day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is it better than America?” his nephew asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Chun Fat hesitated. He had loved the wild cold mountains of California, and the lusty grandeur of San Francisco and the Mexican women with their songs, but he could not forget the Fragrant Tree Country. “It is a softer land,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could a man make money there?” Mun Ki pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s gentler,” his uncle replied, and Mun Ki’s mind was made up in that instant, for he thought: “If my uncle loves a land more for its beauty than for its money, it must be a wonderful land indeed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki was therefore the first to step forward and volunteer. “I’ll go to the Fragrant Tree Land,” he announced firmly, and when the American in the dark suit held out his hand, the Cantonese merchant shouted in Punti, “Take the hand, you idiot! Take it!”</p>

  <p class="normal">This infuriated Uncle Chun Fat, who snapped: “We do not require a Cantonese fool who has shoes like rags to tell us how to act. Stand back or I’ll break your head.” Then, to the American, he said, in English, “Me Chun Fat, long time California. My boy, he go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The American again extended his hand graciously and said, “I am Dr. John Whipple. I would like to hire about three hundred men for the sugar fields.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat looked at the slim, gray-haired American in the expensive suit and instinctively recognized him as a big boss. “How much you offer to pay that one?” he asked, indicating with contempt the Cantonese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m afraid that’s none of your business,” Dr. Whipple replied. “But what did you have in mind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Chun Fat did some fast calculating. In the Kee family alone there were more than one hundred and forty able-bodied men. “Boss, I get you all men two dollars each man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now John Whipple did his own calculating. The Cantonese merchant whom he had brought with him could speak English, and had helped in that regard, but he had no sense of how to enlist labor. It was pretty obvious that this wily fellow from California knew what was required. But two dollars a head? “I’ll give you one dollar and a half a head,” he proposed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat studied that for some time, then replied slowly, “Who gonna argue with women? Who speak everything right?” He enumerated a long list of tasks he could be counted on to perform.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two dollars,” he said firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“One-seventy-five,” Whipple countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Boss,” Uncle Chun Fat smiled sweetly, “I top man here. Unless I speak, they no go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two dollars,” Dr. Whipple surrendered. Instantly Uncle Chun Fat thrust his hand out and grabbed Whipple’s, shouting to his people in Punti, “When you shake hands like this, by god, you believe what you say! I’m warning you, everyone of you!”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was appalled, however, by Dr. Whipple’s one stipulation: “Sir, I do not agree to this bargain unless half the men you send are Hakka.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Chun Fat looked at the stranger blankly. Finally, he repeated dully, “Hakka?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, you know. Hakka. Up there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How in the world did he know about the Hakka?” Chun Fat thought despairingly. “Did that foul Cantonese . . .” To Dr. Whipple he said, “Why you want Hakka? No good Hakka.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple looked him sternly in the eye, and his forty years of trading for J &amp; W fortified his judgment. “We have heard,” he said slowly, “that Hakka are fine workmen. We know that the Punti are clever, for we have many in Hawaii. But Hakka can work. Shall we go up to that village?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat faced a desperate impasse. He could see as clearly as he could see his hand those lush valleys of the Fragrant Tree Land. Good heavens, a hard-working Chinese set loose there could make a million dollars if he were clever! And think of the advantage to the Low Village to have three hundred Kees working there and sending money back home regularly. Uncle Chun Fat could be sure of getting not less than fifteen cents out of every incoming dollar. It would be a calamity, a disaster worse than a flood, for the Kees to miss such an opportunity. But this stern, straight man had mentioned the Hakka . . .</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dr. Whipple,” Uncle Chun Fat began cautiously, “maybe Hakka work well but too much fight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will go to the village alone,” Dr. Whipple said sternly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How you talk with Hakka?” Chun Fat asked slyly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple smiled superiorly at the wily negotiator and said simply, “My friend from Canton will do the translating.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But he no speak Hakka,” Uncle Chun Fat said evenly, smiling back at his visitor.</p>

  <p class="normal">With no evidence of frustration Whipple asked, “Do you speak Hakka?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Only one man speak Hakka. My boy Kee Mun Ki. In army he learn few words.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suppose you want two dollars for each Hakka, too?” Whipple suggested hesitantly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, because speak Hakka very difficult.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s go,” Whipple said with a resigned shrug of his shoulders, and then from the manner in which Chun Fat hesitated he realized with amazement that no one from the Low Village had ever climbed to the High Village. “You’ve never been up there?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hakka up there,” Chun Fat shuddered.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Dr. Whipple saw how difficult it was proving to be to reach Hakka country, he was momentarily inclined to forget the matter and was about to surrender and allow Chun Fat to supply only Punti, but then his scientific interest asserted itself and he reflected: “I came here to initiate an experiment to see who would best satisfy our labor needs on the plantations, Punti or Hakka, and I’m not going to be bluffed out of that study now.” So he said firmly, “If you can’t lead the way, I will.” And for all his sixty-six years he was as spry as the Chinese, and after a sturdy climb the travelers came at last to the gateway of the walled village, and as they entered and saw the frugal U-shaped homes and the brooding, worm-eaten pole in the central square, on which perched the skull of Char the rebel, Whipple looked about him as if he had come upon familiar terrain and thought: “The climb was worth it. This feels like a New England village. I’m home again, in China.” The feeling was intensified when strong, sullen and suspicious Hakka began cautiously gathering about him, and he could see in their conservative faces portraits in yellow of his own ancestors. Motioning to Kee Mun Ki to interpret, he said, “I have come to take one hundred and fifty of you to the sugar fields of the Fragrant Tree Country.” There was much subdued discussion of this, heightened by Uncle Chun Fat, who officiously passed among the Hakka his sandalwood box, with the assurance: “Where you’re going smells like this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the end one hundred and thirty Hakka were conscripted for the Whipple plantations, with promises of twenty more to be gathered from other mountain villages, and as the deal was being formalized with much cautious nodding, Whipple happened to notice that these upland women did not bind their feet, and he pointed to one woman and asked Uncle Chun Fat, “Why are their feet normal?” And the Californian replied, “They Hakka. Not got good sense.” And Whipple asked, “Would women be allowed to come to the Fragrant Tree Country?” And Chun Fat replied, “Maybe Hakka women. Not proper Punti women.” At the moment Whipple said no more about it, but he thought to himself: “Some day we’ll need many Chinese women in Hawaii. Be a good idea to bring these Hakka in. They look strong and intelligent.”</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN</span> DR. <span>WHIPPLE</span> and his Cantonese guide had returned to Hong Kong, there to wait in Whipple’s ship for the arrival of the three hundred plantation hands, Uncle Chun Fat engaged in a flurry of action. He assembled his extensive family in the open area before the newly painted ancestral hall, and on its steps he had an imposing chair placed, in which he sat, wearing his satin skullcap, expensive gown and brocaded shoes. To his right, but a little behind him, sat his legal wife, a woman of fifty, while to his left and farther behind sat the two attractive unofficial wives to which he, as a wealthy man, was entitled. The meeting got right down to business, with Uncle Chun Fat informing his four hundred-odd relatives: “This is an opportunity that may never come again. Think of it!” and he leaned back so that the Kees could see him in his days of lassitude. “A young man goes to the Fragrant Tree Country, works a dozen years, sends his money home to the Low Village, where his wife is bringing up fine sons, and after a while he returns a very wealthy man and takes two or three young wives. He is happy. His wife is happy because she no longer has to work. The young wives are happy because they have a rich man. And,” he said dramatically, pointing casually behind him with his thumb, “he can build a respectable ancestral hall in honor of his distinguished family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He allowed this recipe for earthly happiness to mature in the minds of his listeners and then said, “I am distressed that Dr. Whipple would not take his entire shipload from our village, for we could have supplied him, but even so our opportunity is historic. I am going to point to the strongest young men, and you are the ones who will start for Hong Kong … in three weeks.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Chun Fat rose, passed through the crowd, and arbitrarily nominated eighty-six Kees to volunteer for the journey. Some did not want to go, but they were powerless, for wasn’t Chun Fat the richest man in the world? Who could argue with such a man? When this job was done their Uncle Chun Fat asked, “We now have remaining sixty-four places for the Low Village. Who should fill them?” And there was public discussion of this important point until the gambler Kee Mun Ki, who was proving to be a rather clever young man, pointed out: “Why not take the men who are about to marry girls from our family?” But Uncle Chun Fat rejected this, for it would take money from the village, and made an even wiser proposal, which the family recognized at once as a sound course of action: “We will send everyone who owes us substantial sums of money. And their wages will come to us.” In this way the list was completed. Of the one hundred and fifty Punti who were sent, one hundred and ten did not want to go.</p>

  <p class="normal">Following the nominations, there was a moment of relaxation during which Uncle Chun Fat studied his vast family with care, and when the mood was right he coughed twice, and the crowd dutifully lapsed into silence to hear what tie great man had to say. Chun Fat, looking thoughtfully over the heads of the gathering, said slowly, knowing that what he was about to propose would come as a surprise to his clan, “I want everyone who, for the honor of his family, has volunteered to go to the Fragrant Tree Country to get married before he leaves this village.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A blizzard of excitement struck the Kee family, and many young men who had been forced by Uncle Chun Fat to accept exile to the sugar fields now indicated that they did not propose further to wreck their lives by hastily taking a wife. Grandly, aloofly, Uncle Chun Fat allowed the storm to rage, and when it had reached a climax, he coughed again, and somehow the quiet cough of a rich man is louder than the braying of six paupers, and the great family grew silent. “For example, in my brother’s family I have decided that his son Kee Mun Ki should marry at once, and I have consequently been in contact with . . .” And here he paused dramatically to allow the family to savor his next words, and no one listened with more apprehension than the young gambler Mun Ki, for no one had told him he was about to marry. “I have been consulting with the Kung family of the next village and they have agreed to betroth their daughter Summer Bird to my nephew. Negotiations are already under way to celebrate this marriage, and, Mun Ki, I must congratulate you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young gambler gave a silly grin, accompanied by the required show of joy, for he recognized that Uncle Chun Fat had done a good thing for him. The Kungs of the next village, though not so rich as the Kees of this, were nevertheless a distinguished family, the principal difference being that their leader had gone not to California but only to Canton and had returned not with more than forty thousand dollars but with six. Nevertheless, it was a match that all in the Low Village approved, even though no one had yet seen the intended bride.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So I insist that every young man marry,” Chun Fat concluded. “Families can start sending out messengers at once to find likely girls, and I think it would be proper if celebrations were combined, so as to save money.” Now that the marriages were agreed upon, and the families realized that they must actually set out to find wives for their departing sons, a new storm of agitation swept over the Kees, and again Uncle Chun Fat waited grandly in his satin skullcap until it had pretty well run its course. Then, with the grandeur of the ancestral hall looming behind him as if to fortify his edicts, he coughed quietly and gave the young men certain assurances. “You young travelers, like Mun Ki, must not think that because you are required to marry here in the Low Village that you may not also take wives in the new land. Oh no, indeed! There is only one reason why you must get married here, and establish your home here, with your legal wife waiting patiently for your return. If you do these things, then no matter where you go, you will always think of this village as your permanent home. You will yearn for the day when, like me, you stride up these sacred steps,” and sweeping his expensive gown about him, he marched into the ancestral hall, from which he cried with real passion, “and you will bow humbly before the tablets of your ancestors. For your home is here.” Gravely he bowed before the memorials of the ancients whose energies had built this village, and in deeply moving syllables he said, “When the white men abused me in California, I remembered this pavilion with my family tablets, and I gained strength to endure their abuse. When the snows were unbearable in Nevada, I remembered this ancestral hall, and they became endurable. Marry a girl from this valley, as I did thirty years ago. Leave her here with your home, and no matter where you go, you will come back.” Then, adding a more immediately practical note, he reminded them: “And you will always send money back to this village.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Grandly, he left the ancestral tablets and returned to his chair, from which he reasoned directly: “But we know that it is always better when a Chinese man has some woman with him, so it would be wise if, when you get to the Fragrant Tree Country, you took a wife there too. And the reason I say this is that while I was in America I noticed again and again that the Chinese men who made the most money were those with women. You might think it ought to be the other way around, but as long as I had no woman I did rather poorly . . . gambling . . . bad houses . . . and I may as well confess it, I got drunk every night for almost a year. Well, anyway, I found this Mexican woman and pretty soon I had her washing for the miners and cooking their food. And consider this, you Kees who are departing for a strange country. Even though I had to pay much money for her food, for she ate like a pig, and even though she was always wanting a new dress, it was only because of her that I saved any money. Therefore, it seems to me that if a bright young man like my nephew Mun Ki were to marry the Kung girl here, and then also find a strong wife for himself in the Fragrant Tree Country … but be sure to get one who can work . . . well,” and Uncle Chun Fat coughed modestly, hiding his lips with his silken-sleeved hand, “it would not surprise me at all if he were to return to this village a much richer man than I am.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With a new flush of modesty he dropped his eyes and allowed this dazzling prospect to capture his family. Not for a summer’s moment did he believe that Mun Ki or anyone else would come close to his record of more than forty thousand dollars, but from the corner of his eye he saw with assurance that some of the young men were instinctively looking out across the fields and planning where, among the hills, they would build their cemeteries when they returned with staggering riches. But from the rear of the family came a nagging question: “When Mun Ki returns a wealthy man, does he bring his strange wife back to this village?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Certainly not,” Uncle Chun Fat said evenly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What does he do with her?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He leaves her where he found her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A buzz of admiration swept over the crowd, for the solution was both right and simple. The Low Village would be contaminated if it had to accept wives with strange customs, and while the elders were congratulating Chun Fat on his perspicacity, he quieted them and told the sprawling family: “The other wives will be able to care for themselves. When I left California I had three wives. A Mexican in San Francisco and two Indians in different parts of the mountains. They had helped me, so I helped them. I gave each one a thousand dollars.” The crowd gasped at Chun Fat’s compassion, and he concluded: “Because the important thing in a man’s life is to return home to his village, to find his patient wife waiting, and in his old age to acquire two or three beautiful young girls of good family.” Behind him his three wives smiled gently as he said, “Believe me, under those circumstances a man’s joy is great.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the young gambler Mun Ki accepted the betrothal his uncle had arranged for him, Chun Fat sent the Kungs in the next village not the customary thousand cakes—”Your daughter is worth one thousand pieces of gold, but please accept these poor cakes”—but two thousand and forty-three, the idea being that the number really could have been as large as he wished. Each cake was the size of a plate: soft sponge cakes, cakes stuffed with chopped nuts and sugar, hard flat cakes, cakes lined with rich mince, and others decorated with expensive sweetmeats. He also sent sixty-nine pigs, four chickens with red feathers, and four large baked fish. Then, to prove his munificence, he added forty-seven pieces of gold, each wrapped in red paper. The procession that carried these things to the Kungs was a quarter of a mile in length.</p>

  <p class="normal">From two of the ceremonial pigs the bride’s family cut off the heads and tails, wrapped them in silk and returned them to the Kees, indicating that the largesse had been both humbly and impressively received by the bride’s family. But on her own account she sent three gifts to the groom: an embroidered red cloth which he would use as a belt, a wallet for the worldly wealth which she would help him earn, and two pairs of pants.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was obviously going to be a tremendous wedding, and it dwarfed the thirty-one others that were proceeding at the same time. Two weeks before the Kees were scheduled to depart for the ship waiting at Hong Kong, the ceremony took place amid all the grandeur the two Lowland villages could provide, and when the days of celebration ended, young Kee Mun Ki brought his bride home and tried mightily to impregnate her before the time for sailing, but he failed.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the morning when Uncle Chun Fat assembled his hundred and fifty Punti for the three-day hike to Canton, where they would board a river steamer for Hong Kong and the American ship, he saw before him a rather bleary-eyed, sexually exhausted group of men. “A good march along the river will toughen them up,” he reassured himself, because he realized that if he could deliver his volunteers in good condition, he had a right to expect that subsequently Dr. Whipple would commission him to conscript many more, all at two dollars a head. He therefore moved among his troops encouraging them to spruce up, but when he came to his nephew Kee Mun Ki, he scarcely recognized him. The young gambler had been drunk for two weeks, hardly out of bed for ten days, and looked as if he might collapse during the first hundred yards of the march to Canton. Realizing that he had to depend upon this youth for transmitting orders to the Hakka, Uncle Chun Fat started slapping him back and forth across the cheeks, and slowly the young man’s eyes began to focus. “I’ll be all right,” the gambler mumbled. “In Macao once I was drunk for three weeks. But not with a fine wife like the Kung girl.” And Chun Fat saw with pleasure that when his nephew’s services were really required, the brash young gambler would be ready. “You’ll do well in the Fragrant Tree Country,” Chun Fat reassured the young man. “I expect to,” the young husband replied. It was just a little insulting, the way in which he spoke to his uncle on a man-to-man basis, as if they were equals.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now came a moment of intense excitement, for down from the hills marched the contingent of Hakka, thin men, dressed in rude, tough clothing, their pigtails long and their faces tanned. Two months before, the arrival of such a group would have signified war; now it occasioned only mutual disgust. Defiantly, the Hakka marched up to where the Punti stood, and against his own prejudices Uncle Chun Fat thought: “They’ll do well in the new country.” Because he was making two dollars a head on the Hakka, and hoped to make more in the future, he wanted to go up to them and bow in greeting, but he realized that this might be interpreted as Punti subservience and would never be forgiven by his family, so he glared at them as custom required. For a long moment the two groups stood staring insolently at each other. During nearly a thousand years they had lived side by side without ever speaking; they had met only in death and violence; there had been only one marriage. Now, with their inherited hatreds, they were going to travel in a small ship to a small island.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki broke the spell. Pulling himself together, he stepped forward and said to a man named Char, leader of the Hakka, “We will start to Canton now. Some of your men look tired already.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Char studied the young Punti to see if this was intended as an insult, and replied evenly, “No wonder they look tired. They’ve been drunk for two weeks . . . like you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I got married,” Mun Ki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So did they,” the Hakka Char said, and the antagonists smiled.</p>

  <p class="normal">The contingents started forward, but as they did, the Punti looked for the last time at their Low Village and its bright red ancestral hall. This was their home, the soil of their heart, the abiding place of their ancestors. Their wives were here. Many had sons whose names were already on the tablets in the pavilion. The graves where the ghosts of their forefathers walked at night were in this land, and to leave the Golden Valley even for a few years was punishment almost beyond the bearing. “I will come back soon!” Mun Ki called, not to his wife, nor to his domineering uncle, nor to any living person. “I will come back!” he called to his ancestors.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took three days to reach Canton, the Punti moving together in one group, the Hakka in another, and during this vigorous exercise Kee Mun Ki whipped himself back into his customary lean condition. His eyes cleared and his wits sharpened, and as he entered the great city, seeking out Dr. Whipple to deliver the workers, he wondered if he could slip away for a few hours for some intense gambling with the British sailors at the quay, but unfortunately Dr. Whipple had a river boat waiting and herded his charges directly aboard. When they were assembled he spoke to them in quiet English, and his interpreter explained: “The American has discovered that if he tries to take you men out of China by way of Hong Kong, where his ship is visible in the bay, the government will execute every one of you. For daring to leave China. So we are sailing to Macao, where it will be possible to depart without being killed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Quickly Mun Ki moved up to the interpreter and said, “In Macao I must see my old employer and bid him farewell. Please tell the American.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was some discussion and the interpreter said, “All right. But the others must stay overnight inside a compound until the ship arrives from Hong Kong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki congratulated himself and began daydreaming of the great fortune he would make on his last hours at the gambling tables, when the interpreter returned and dashed his fantasies by announcing: “The American remembers that you are the only one who can speak with the Hakka, so you will not be allowed to leave the compound.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki tried to appeal this unfair decision, but the interpreter, after discussing the protest with Whipple, said bluntly, “You will stay inside the compound.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the coastline of Macao appeared, with its low white Portuguese buildings shining in the sunlight, and its military guard loafing about in European uniforms, the Punti and Hakka workers lined the river boat to study the strange port: a foreign city nestling on the coast of China, a city with one European for every two hundred Chinese, a curious, lawless enclave that was neither China nor Portugal but the worst of each. But to Mun Ki, well versed in the evil ways of Macao, it was a pragmatist’s paradise. He saw the tiled roofs of the Brothel of Spring Nights and thought tenderly of some of the girls he had helped to bring there, strong, happy girls who enjoyed their work. Farther on he saw the gambling halls, where he had known both success and failure, and as the river boat drew closer to the shore, so his excitement mounted, until at last he moved swiftly among the Punti, whispering, “Lend me your money! I am going to the gambling halls and I will return with two for one.” Some were suspicious of their brash cousin; others respected him for his daring, and in time he had a considerable number of coins. “I’ll see you tomorrow,” he whispered. “Say nothing to the fool from Canton.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So when the river boat touched the quay, and there was much jostling among the Chinese and calls back and forth between the Portuguese officials, Mun Ki slipped deftly away, disappeared into the piles of merchandise stacked along the quay, and hurried up a back alley to the Brothel of Spring Nights. “You must have celebrated the festival of Ching Ming as never before,” the brothel keeper observed icily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I got married,” Mun Ki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, that’s very good!” the keeper expounded. “Every man should have a loyal and patient wife. I count the beginning of my happiness from the day I married and began having a large family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am also leaving China for the Fragrant Tree Country,” Mun Ki said honestly. “I’ve come to get my things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re leaving me!” the proprietor stormed. “After I’ve spent all this time and money training . . .” Suddenly he stopped ranting and asked, “Did you say the Fragrant Tree Country?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Sugar fields.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now that’s really strange!” the brothel keeper cried, tapping his knee with his forefinger. “I have some rather important work that requires doing in that country. Yes.” He went to a file of papers and sorted out one from a Punti who had gone to the Fragrant Tree land some years before, and this man, remembering how well the Brothel of Spring Nights had been run in Macao, had written to the proprietor asking for certain assistance. Holding the letter between his teeth, Mun Ki’s superior studied the young gambler and then asked, “Would you be willing to execute a rather difficult commission for me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do I get paid?” Uncle Chun Fat’s nephew asked bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll do it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought you would.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s the job?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve got a girl tied up in the little room. Been planning to ship her to Manila. We can’t use her here, as you’ll see. Will you deliver her to my friend in the Fragrant Tree Country?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will. Which room?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The one where the Russian girl used to be.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki forgot his gambling for a moment, walked down a narrow hall, and kicked open the familiar door. Inside, the blinds were drawn, and in the darkness, on the floor, lay a trussed-up girl, knees lashed to chin, almost unconscious from hunger and lack of water. With his foot Mun Ki rolled her over and saw that she was dressed in a cheap blue cotton smock and trousers; her big feet proved that she was a Hakka. In disgust Mun Ki slammed the door and returned to his employer.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who wants a Hakka?” he demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nobody,” the brothel keeper agreed. “I paid some of General Wang’s soldiers to kidnap half a dozen girls, and they brought back this one. I was going to send her to Manila. Over there they don’t know the difference.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much for me if I take her to the Fragrant Tree Country?” Mun Ki asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Twenty Mexican dollars,” the proprietor replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Paid now? I’d like to double it in the gambling rooms.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Half paid now,” the canny brothel keeper agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He gave Mun Ki the ten Mexican dollars, and the young man was about to dash over to the gambling, but the proprietor suggested, “Maybe you better feed her. She’s been tied up for two days. The soldiers seem to have treated her rather badly before they turned her in, and I was afraid she might run away after I had paid for her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you give much?” Mun Ki inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For a Hakka? That I couldn’t use?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young gambler returned to the room, yelled for a maid to bring him some hot tea and rice, and then parted the curtains. He saw at his feet a young Hakka woman of about eighteen. Even when her face healed she would probably not be a pretty woman, and the manner in which she was gagged and trussed did not permit any estimate of her general appearance. Therefore, more in a spirit of investigation than humanity Mun Ki kneeled down and started to untie the merciless ropes. As he loosened one after the other, he could hear the girl groaning with relief, but he noticed that even so her limbs did not automatically stretch out toward their normal position, for they had been constricted so long that some of their muscles had gone into spasm. Again motivated by investigation, he started gently to unfold her hands and pull her arms down along her body. He pushed her shoulders back and could hear joints creaking in protest. She groaned deeply and fainted, but then the maid brought the tray, and he applied tea to her lips and gradually she regained consciousness and began to drink. She was so desperate for liquids that even Mun Ki was impressed, and he sent for more tea. As its warmth circulated through her body, the girl began to return to an awareness of where she was, and she looked in terror at the man who held her, but the manner in which he started to feed her the rice, waiting until she had chewed each grain lovingly, lest someone steal it from her . . . this made her think that perhaps he might not be like the others who had captured her that night before the Ching Ming festival. The things they had done in the three weeks they had dragged her and their other captives through the countryside she had already forgotten, for they were too terrible to remember. Instinctively she felt that this man would not treat her so.</p>

  <p class="normal">Char Nyuk Tsin was the first Hakka the young gambler had ever touched, and it was with instinctive loathing that he now did so, and yet it was a strange fact that her response to his kindness moved him and made him want to be kinder yet. He held her shoulders in his left arm and fed her warm rice with his right, and when the maid brought in some cabbage broth, he gave her the spoon and encouraged her to eat, but her wrists were so swollen from the ropes that she could not do so. He therefore started to massage them, and gradually blood circulated to her fingers and she could hold the spoon, but she could not operate her shoulders. So he massaged her back and neck, and instinctively his hand slipped forward over her shoulders and he felt her hard little breasts. Almost against his will there came a moment of awakening, and he felt memories of his soft young wife from the Kung village come flooding over him, and he lifted away Nyuk Tsin’s smock and caressed her body, and then he slipped off her trousers, and when her knees and ankles remained in their rigid, muscle-locked condition, he gently massaged them until they relaxed, and he saw with increasing pleasure how slim and beautiful this girl’s body was. Reminded of his bride, he quickly slid out of his clothes and threw them against the door, saying to the Hakka girl as he did so, “I will not hurt you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he had been with her for some time the proprietor came back to the little room to advise him on how to deliver the girl to the brothel keeper in Honolulu, but when he pushed open the door a little way and saw what the young people were up to, he advised in Punti, “Use her as you wish, but tie her up again when you’re through.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The voice of the boss awakened Mun Ki to his responsibilities, and with real fright he grabbed at his pants to see if while he had been engaged with the girl some clever man had stolen his gambling money in the way that he, Mun Ki, had sometimes picked the pockets of preoccupied customers in the Brothel of Spring Nights. His money was secure, so he quickly dressed and said to the naked girl, “I must go to the gambling. Put your clothes on.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as he waited for her to do so, he picked up the cords, and when she turned to face him she saw the cruel, biting cords and tears came into her eyes and she pleaded with Mun Ki and took his hands and promised, “I will not run away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He held the ropes and studied her, and something in the manner in which she looked at him convinced him that she would not flee; so, still grasping the ropes, he led her to his room in a hovel in back of the brothel, where he sat her upon the floor. Dangling the ropes before her terrified face he seemed to ask: “Am I required to use these?” and she looked at him as if to promise: “You do not need the cords.” Against his better judgment, he started to leave, but to do so with the girl unbound was obviously ridiculous, so he decided upon a sensible solution. With one end of a fairly long rope he tied the Hakka girl’s left wrist; the other he attached about his own waist, and when this was done he said, “Come.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he passed the desk of the brother the proprietor saw what he was doing, and said, “A good idea.” Then the man asked professionally, “Will she make a good girl for my friend?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Mun Ki assured him, and he led his captive to his favorite gambling hall. But when they were in the street he stopped and asked her, “What is your name?” and she answered, “Char Nyuk Tsin,” and he replied, “Perfect Jade! That’s a good name.” To himself he thought: “In a brothel it’s a very good name. A man can remember it when he comes back the next time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The gamblers were playing fan-tan, in which from a large pile of snowy-white ivory buttons the dealer withdrew a handful, whereupon the crowd bet as to whether the number to be left over at the end was one, two, three, or none. Or, if the gamblers wished, they could bet simply on whether the ivory buttons would turn out to have been odd or even. When the bets were placed, the amazingly deft dealer started to pull his buttons away from the pile in lots of four, and it was striking how skilled the players were in discerning, while the pile of burtons still contained fifty or sixty, what the number left over at the end was bound to be.</p>

  <p class="normal">Using his own and other Punti money, Mun Ki had a satisfactory run at fan-tan, and he felt that perhaps the fact that he had been kind to the Hakka girl had brought him good luck, so he took his earnings to the mah-jongg room, where the clattering ivory tiles evoked their perpetual fascination. When at the beginning of each game the players built their wall, it was customary for them to slam the tiles down with maximum force, creating an echo that accentuated the natural excitement of the game, and likewise, when a player scored a coup and exposed his pieces he slammed them onto the noisy table. Mah-jongg as played in Macao was a wild, exhilarating game, and now Mun Ki decided to test his luck at a table where real gamblers played for high stakes. Placing Nyuk Tsin behind him, and twitching the cord now and then to be sure she was still tied, he joined three waiting men. Two had long, wispy beards and costly gowns. The other was more like Mun Ki, a young, aggressive gambler. At first one of the older men protested, “I do not wish to play in a room where there is a woman,” but Mun Ki carefully explained, “I am taking her to a brothel in the Fragrant Tree Country and am responsible for her.” This the men understood; in fact, the man who had protested thought: “Probably he will have his mind on the girl and will lose more quickly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Mun Ki had not entered the game to lose. Mah-jongg, unlike fan-tan, did not depend so much on luck as on the skill with which one played the pieces luck sent him; and the young gambler, thinking that this might be his last day in a big mah-jongg contest, breathed deeply as he used both hands to help mix the 144 tiles at the start of the game. With loud energy he banged the pieces down to make the wall and then watched carefully as he rolled his dice to help determine where that wall should be broached to begin the gambling. With intense excitement he grabbed his tiles in turn and remembered Nyuk Tsin only when he leaned forward to reach the tiles and felt her rope tugging at his waist. When his tiles were arranged—and he had long since learned to keep them in haphazard formations from which his clever opponents could deduce nothing—he was ready to play, but the bearded man who had originally protested against Nyuk Tsin, said, “She has got to sit on the floor where she can’t spy.” So before the game began in earnest, the Hakka girl sat on the floor, but this was not entirely satisfactory to Mun Ki, who was afraid that she might slip away, so he forced her to sit under the table, against his feet, and there she remained for the long hours during which the four players slammed down their tiles with great force.</p>

  <p class="normal">From her position under the table Nyuk Tsin noticed that she could detect when Mun Ki was attempting some daring coup, holding back tiles in hopes of building them into some fantastic combination that would win him much money, for then his ankles became tense, the little bones stood out and his feet began to sweat. At such times she prayed for his success, and she must have been attuned to some powerful god of good fortune, for her man won. At dusk he tugged on the rope and said, “We’ll go home.” But as they returned to the dusty streets of Macao, hawkers swarmed about them, attracted by the rumor: “The young fellow from the brothel was a big winner.” They brought flowers and bits of cloth and steaming kettles of food, and Mun Ki found real pleasure in playing the role of a generous winner. Fingering the torn cotton fabric of his girl’s smock he said, “This one needs a new dress, believe me.” And with grandiloquent gestures that all could admire, he announced: “We will have four lengths of that!” He was even more generous when it came to food, and hungry Nyuk Tsin had black eggs, dried fish, noodles and crystallized ginger. As they lounged beneath a dentist’s sign he announced to the crowd: “I am really a very lucky gambler. I can see what’s in the other man’s mind.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As the night wore on, he drew the cord tighter to him, so that Nyuk Tsin could not stray, and he bought bits of food for worthless characters he had long known in the Portuguese city. When the civil guard passed by, he nodded to them, and when one asked, “Why do you have the girl tied up?” he replied in the patois of the port city, “I am delivering her to a brothel in the Fragrant Tree Country.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The police nodded approvingly, and then one stopped. “Are you sailing on that American ship in the bay?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suppose so,” Mun Ki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Instantly the policeman grew confidential, and whispered, “I’d better warn you, then. The American who bought you in the village came to us today to have you arrested. You’d better hide.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m reporting in the morning,” Mun Ki assured him. “But thanks.” And he gave the policeman a coin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank you, Mun Ki!” the official bowed. “That’s a nice girl you’re taking with you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s only a Hakka, but she brings luck,” Mun Ki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally he led his captive back to the Brothel of Spring Nights, where he showed his former boss how he had multiplied the ten Mexican dollars eight times. “This girl brings luck,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you going to tie her up again in the little room?” the proprietor asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’ll sleep with me tonight,” Mun Ki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right,” the prudent businessman replied, “but remember what you learned here about breaking girls in. Feed them and beat them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll take care of her,” Mun Ki assured him. “Were the police here for me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course,” his boss replied. “Your ship’s sailing tomorrow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll be there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tugging the cord, he led Nyuk Tsin down the narrow hallway, out the back door of the brothel and on to the hovel where he slept. Locking the door, he untied the rope from his waist, but fastened it even more securely about Nyuk Tsin’s wrist. She explained that she needed to attend to her bodily functions, so he opened the door and allowed her to go outside while he lounged in the doorway, testing the rope now and then to be sure that she was still secured. When she returned he said, “Now we must pack for the journey.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He had provided a wooden tub into which he jammed his accumulated treasures: a teapot, five bamboo cups, two good rice bowls, a metal pot, a porcelain tea set with a small copper strainer, a bamboo tray for steaming vegetables and a large knife. The incense burner, the kitchen god and the ancestral tablet which proved who he was were tucked into place, followed by his extra clothes and a pair of good sandals. Over this tub he now tied securely a piece of canvas stolen from a Dutch ship.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a wicker basket Nyuk Tsin packed the food for the trip: soy vinegar, pickled cabbage, spices, dried fish, seeds to chew on and several chunks of flattened duck. The implements for cooking also went into the basket: chopsticks, a charcoal stove, one old cup and two old rice bowls.</p>

  <p class="normal">The little room now contained only a bed and a poem. The former would be rolled up in the morning; the latter, which explained the manner in which the names of one Kee generation followed another, was contained in a red-lined book in which the genealogy was kept, and as the most precious of Kee Mun Ki’s possessions, it would be the last to leave and would be carried by Mun Ki himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Surveying the quarters in which he had lived with reasonable happiness, and from which he had moved out to become a skilled gambler, Mun Ki sighed. Then, seeing Nyuk Tsin standing forlorn in the middle of the dimly lit room, he said, “You may undress now,” and when she untied her wrist and dropped away her clothes, and when he saw that the cord marks were disappearing from her body, he smiled and indicated that she could sleep with him. Since she had expected to be tied up again and thrown onto the floor, she came to him gratefully and was not afraid when he began quietly to enjoy her. He was the first man who had ever touched her with what could even remotely be termed affection, and she found herself reciprocating. They had a vigorous passage of love and Mun Ki thought: “In some way she’s better than my Kung wife.” When they were through he remembered to reach for the cord to tie her to him, but when he took her wrists she pleaded: “It is not necessary.” He was tempted to believe her, but he knew that if she ran away he would not only look the fool but would also be required to refund the ten Mexican dollars plus whatever his boss had paid the kidnapers, so he lashed her wrists to his; but he did allow her to sleep beside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the morning, when they were dressed, he finally threw away the rope, for he thought: “If I report to Dr. Whipple leading this girl by a rope, he will hardly believe my story that I am married to her,” and on his ability so to convince the American depended the success of this voyage. But when the rope fell in the dust of the little room, Nyuk Tsin stooped down and retrieved it for tying her basket of food. When they left the room, Nyuk Tsin carried the tub and the heavy basket. Mun Ki carried the feather-light bedroll and the genealogy book, but after he had stepped into the filthy yard behind the brothel, Nyuk Tsin called to him and pointed to the wall above where the bed had stood and where a sign now hung that she could not read. Mun Ki whistled at his forgetfulness and recovered the omen of special good fortune: “May This Bed Yield a Hundred Sons!” Tucking it under his arm, he led his woman to the waiting ship.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the quay Dr. Whipple stood ready to berate the only man he had who could converse with the Hakka, and as soon as Mun Ki appeared, the Cantonese interpreter started shouting at him, but he ignored the man and marched contritely up to the American. Bowing his head in feigned apologies he said softly, “I am a thousand times humble, sir, for having run away.” Then, producing the overburdened Nyuk Tsin, he said simply, “I had to find my good wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your wife!” the interpreter stormed. “No women are allowed on this . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple, noticing the girl’s big feet, asked, “Isn’t she a Hakka?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Mun Ki replied, and the American scientist, remembering how he had once idly considered the desirability of importing some Hakka women to Hawaii, asked, “Do you wish to take her with you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">When this was interpreted, Mun Ki piously nodded and explained: “I could not bear to leave her behind.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m willing to try it,” Whipple announced. Then he warned Mun Ki: “But when she gets to Hawaii, she’s got to work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’ll work,” Mun Ki assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment the hundred and fifty Hakka men saw Char Nyuk Tsin for the first time since her abduction on the Eve of Ching Ming, and they began to cry to her, and Mun Ki knew that if they explained who she was, his fanciful story would be exploded, but he also realized that no one on the quay but he could understand what they were saying, so he nudged Nyuk Tsin and told her, “Speak to them.” Pushing her toward the Hakka, he followed behind and cried to the men, “This girl is my wife.” And the Hakka saw about his waist a red marriage belt and they began to wonder what had happened. “Are you indeed married to the Punti?” they shouted. Mun Ki jabbed his girl in the back and whispered, “Tell them you are.” So Nyuk Tsin informed her countrymen, none of whom had ever befriended her after her parents’ death, “He is my husband.” And the Hakka looked at her in scorn and would have no more to do with her, for their parents had often warned them about what had happened to the disgraceful Hakka girl who had married a Punti man in 1693.</p>

  <p class="normal">This problem settled, quick-thinking Mun Ki now faced one far more serious, for Dr. Whipple was calling, through his interpreter, for the married couple to join him, but when Mun Ki and Nyuk Tsin started to do so, they had to pass through the Punti contingent, and these men were even more outraged at Mun Ki than the Hakka had been. They, too, had been well drilled in the evil that had befallen the Punti man who had dared to marry a Hakka girl back in 1693, and they drew away from Mun Ki as if he were unclean, but as he passed each group he muttered to those from whom he had borrowed: “Last night. Big winnings. Lots of money for you.” And this softened their anger.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he reached Dr. Whipple, the American said, “We will have to ask the captain of the ship if he will accept another passenger. And if he says yes, you will have to pay passage money for your wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He therefore sent a sailor in search of the captain, and in a moment a towering American loomed among the Chinese, a man in his seventies, with stout muscles and a sea cap jammed on the back of his head. He had fierce, dynamic eyes and looked at the men about to board his ship as if he hated each one of them with deep, personal anger. Brushing them away as he strode through their groups, he came up to Whipple and asked, “What is it, John?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Captain Hoxworth,” the trim, gray-haired scientist began, “I find one man wants to bring his wife along.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You willing to pay five dollars’ passage money?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I’ll get it from the man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then it’s simple,” the captain growled. “She can come.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple conveyed the news to Mun Ki, who grinned happily, explaining to the interpreter, “A man would not like to leave his wife in Macao.” Dr. Whipple was impressed by this sentiment and asked Captain Hoxworth, “Where will the couple sleep?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the hold!” Hoxworth snapped with some surprise that the question should have been asked. “Where the hell do you suppose they would sleep?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought,” Whipple began, “that with her the only woman, and three hundred men . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the hold!” Hoxworth shouted. Then, addressing the Chinese, who could not possibly understand him, he roared, “Because when this ship sails I don’t want to see one goddamned Chinee anywhere but locked up in the hold. I’m warning you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rafer,” Dr. Whipple began again. “In the case of this couple, couldn’t they stay with …” –</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Hoxworth turned quickly, pointed his long forefinger at his missionary friend, and snapped: “They’ll stay in the hold. How do I know this rascal isn’t a pirate? How do you know he’s married? There’ll be no pigtailed Chinee anywhere on this ship except locked below.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reluctantly Dr. Whipple explained to Mun Ki that if he insisted upon bringing his wife along, she would have to share the hold along with two hundred and ninety-nine other men, but to his confusion Mun Ki evidenced no surprise and Captain Hoxworth observed: “It’s nothing to them. They live like animals.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The moment had now arrived when the Chinese were to board the Carthaginian as it lay alongside the Macao quay, and Portuguese officers, in brilliant uniforms, took their places at the gangplank, checking off numbers rather than the names. The Cantonese interpreter said farewell, and the three hundred Chinese men and their one woman were left alone in two hostile groups, Hakka and Punti, with no one who could converse with the Americans who ran the ship and with only one man, Mun Ki, who could make himself understood to both contingents. However, their thoughts were diverted from their plight by the natural excitement involved in climbing aboard the schooner from whose mast flew the blue H &amp; H flag. When the first Chinese stood at the top of the gangplank and saw before him the great open ocean, he hesitated in natural apprehension, which was increased when a sailor grabbed his pitiful store of belongings to stow them aft. The Punti started after his precious bundle, but he was halted by Captain Hoxworth, who grabbed him by the pigtail, spun him around and with a forceful kick sent him stumbling across the deck. “Get down into the hold, you stupid Chinee!” Hoxworth roared, and when the uncomprehending Punti stood in bewilderment, the captain kicked him again. The Chinese staggered backward toward the open hold, missed the ladder and plunged headfirst fourteen feet into the dark interior of the ship.</p>

  <p class="normal">Instantly the remaining Chinese became tense, and Captain Hoxworth sensed this, for he whipped around, grabbed a belaying pin and took three determined steps toward the men climbing up the gangplank. Cursing them in a language they could not understand, he grabbed the arm of the next Punti, swung him about, and launched him toward the ladder. When the Chinese had sense enough to climb down, the big American roared, “There’s gonna be no trouble aboard this ship!” And he brandished his belaying pin as the future plantation hands disappeared into the dark hold.</p>

  <p class="normal">As they went below, the Chinese caught a last glimpse of their homeland, and unconsolable sorrows assaulted them, for it was a miserable thing when a man left China, and some sensed that never again would they see this great land; no matter how harshly China had treated them it was still the Middle Kingdom, the heavenly land suspended between mere earth and the residence of the gods: the sweeping plains, the rice fields in the spring, the glorious mountains, and the wild, cruel rivers. It was a land men could love, and for each who now deserted it, there came a memory of the village where his ancestral pavilion waited his return.</p>

  <p class="normal">Just before it was Nyuk Tsin’s turn to enter the hold, a thoughtful Punti climbed back out to advise Captain Hoxworth that the first man who had been thrown into the ship had broken his ankle, but when the good Samaritan reached the deck Hoxworth became furious and clouted the man with his belaying pin, knocking him back into the hold, where his friends caught him. “Don’t any of you goddamned Chinee pirates come up onto my deck!” the captain bellowed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was the last person down the ladder, and as she prepared to descend, she saw Dr. Whipple smiling at her while Captain Hoxworth monitored her with his belaying pin. Beyond them she caught a last glimpse of China, and when she thought of the brutal way in which this land had murdered her parents, and of the near starvation in which she had lived, and of the archaic terror she had known with her kidnapers, she was glad to see the end of China. Since she was only a woman, her name appeared in no ancestral hall and there were no ties binding her to the mountains other than the memory of the animal-like loads her uncle had piled upon her, so as she saw her homeland for the last time she whispered to herself, “Farewell, cursed land. I shall never see you again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then she saw at the bottom of the ladder the young gambler, Mun Ki, the only person in many years who had been kind to her, and gladly she climbed down to be with him, and she was gratified when he extended his hand to help her; but she did not know that he was doing so to prevent her from breaking a leg, for an accident like that would seriously diminish her value when it came time to sell her in Honolulu.</p>

  <p class="normal">As she reached bottom, the ladder was hauled out and heavy boards were dropped across the opening. When it became apparent that the hold was to be completely closed, the Chinese began a loud wail of protest, and Captain Hoxworth shouted, “Get the muskets!” When they were produced he ordered three sailors to kneel along the edge of the hold, then he shouted, “Fire!” Shots whistled past the pigtails and crashed into the bulkheads. The terrified Chinese fell to the floor and the last boards of the covering were hammered into place. Now only a faltering light filtered in through a narrow grating, and there was no air, but a sail was rigged on deck so that when the ship was in motion, a breeze would be trapped and funneled below. There was no regular supply of water, only one foul bucket for slops, and such bedding as each man had brought of his own, nor were there any blankets for those who tried to sleep. It was in these quarters that Nyuk Tsin started housekeeping with her gambler, Mun Ki, and his two hundred and ninety-nine companions.</p>

  <p class="normal">One thing was settled quickly. The Punti took their position forward and the Hakka aft, for naturally neither group wished to contaminate itself with the other, and for Nyuk Tsin there was a moment of hesitation when she felt that perhaps she ought to settle down with her own people, but they showed that they wanted nothing to do with a Hakka girl who had married a Punti; and at the same time the Punti made no effort to welcome her, so she took her position in a corner of the Punti terrain, and there she was left alone with her husband. The Punti did, however, bring to her their fellow with the broken ankle and they suggested in signs that she repair the damage. She studied the man’s leg and concluded that the break was not complicated, so she made a splint of chopsticks and lashed it in place with ends of cloth. Then she borrowed bedding from others and made a rude mattress on which the man rested. If there had been water, she would have washed his face, too.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now there was a motion of the ship, a swaying in the offshore breezes and finally the slow, steady roll of the ocean itself. Before long the hold was a confused agony of seasickness, with men vomiting everywhere and then rolling indifferently in it. Nyuk Tsin became so nauseated that she hoped the ship would sink, and in this stench the first awful night passed.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn a sailor opened the grating to pass down some buckets of water, shouting to his mates, “You want to smell the other side of hell?”</p>

  <p class="normal">His friends came over and took a whiff. “How do they stand it?” they asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first explained, “They’re Chinee. They like it that way,” and he jammed the grating back, forgetting to reset the deck sail so that fresh air could funnel in. The day grew increasingly hot and there was insufficient water to wash away the appalling smell, so that most of the three hundred got sicker than before. They sweated, retched, went to the toilet, filled the foul bucket and then used the floor. The heat grew unbearable and the man with the broken ankle started to rave about going home.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the afternoon a little more water was passed down and the sailor shouted, “For Christ’s sake, now smell it!” And his mates agreed that with a hold full of Chinee you could do nothing. This time, however, someone remembered to tip the sail into the breeze, and by evening the hold was beginning to settle into the routine that would be followed for the next forty-six days. At eight in the morning and at four in the afternoon kettles of rice were lowered into the hold, along with stray ends of salt beef. There was no point in trying to serve vegetables or fish. Water was never plentiful, but a system was devised whereby at signals the slop bucket would be hauled up on a rope and emptied. The deck sail was tended so that a minimum breeze was funneled in, but never enough to permit a man a full breath of clean, cold air. The awful smell never abated, a mixture of urine, sweat, bowel movements and seasickness, but it was surprising that even those with especially sensitive stomachs did in time grow accustomed to it, for the odor seemed to represent them, forming a vital part of their foul, cramped quarters.</p>

  <p class="normal">Providentially Mun Ki had brought with him some playing cards, and when his seasickness abated he set up a gambling corner where each day, as long as sunlight filtered through the grating, he tried to win back the money he had paid his Punti friends. He was adept with cards and won small amounts from most of his adversaries, announcing often, as he patted the back of his pigtail: “I’m a very lucky fellow. I understand the run of cards.” When an opponent lost his stake, the nimble-witted gambler suggested: “I’ll lend you some so the game can continue,” and strict accounts were kept of who owed whom and how much. Significantly, no Punti ever promised: “Mun Ki, when we get to the Fragrant Tree Country I will pay you what I owe you.” Instead, they assured him: “When I earn some money, I will send it to Uncle Chun Fat in the Low Village.” For that was home. That was where accounts were kept, the permanent address of a man, the known anchor.</p>

  <p class="normal">One evening when the faltering light no longer permitted gambling, Mun Ki looked at the girl he was convoying to the brothel keeper in Honolulu and reflected: “Perfect Jade! Not exactly perfect with those ugly feet.” In comparison he recalled his soft young wife from the Kung village, well brought up and with small feet, and he would recall the enchanting manner in which a girl with bound feet walked, not like a man at all, but swaying in the ambient light like a flower, her hips moving in a special way calculated to drive a man crazy with desire. Thinking of the subtle poetry with which his young wife moved, he next recalled his remarkable days of playing with that delectable girl, and he reconstructed the things they had done together in the silken bed. He became tumescent, and before night fell with its utter darkness, he studied Nyuk Tsin and thought: “But she can be fun, in her own way, too.” He drew her to him and tried to slip his hands under her clothes, but the Punti were so crowded in the filthy hold that instinctively she drew away, for many were watching her. “They are looking,” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">This irritated Mun Ki, so impulsively he stood and announced: “I am a married man and it is outrageous that I cannot sleep with my wife. I am going to build a corner.” He unrolled all of his bedding, and with the point of a knife began tearing slivers of wood from the bulkhead until he got two stout ones started upon which he could hang his partitions, and before night fell completely, he had cut off a private corner, and when he brought Nyuk Tsin inside he told her that now she could undress, and when they lay locked together on the rough boards of the floor he told her, “Except for your disgraceful feet, you are almost as good as my Kung wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Thereafter, whenever the gambling declined in interest and the long dreary days ended in shadows, Mun Ki would announce: “Well, I am building our corner again!” And the other men, Punti and Hakka alike, honored his arrangement and during the daylight hours treated Nyuk Tsin with increased respect. On the bulkhead Mun Ki hung his good-luck sign: “May This Bed Yield a Hundred Sons.” And although he was unaware of the fact, the sign was effective, and in due course Nyuk Tsin would bear him a son.</p>

  <p class="normal">AT <span>THE BEGINNING</span> of the second week it became obvious that the broken ankle of the Punti man was not going to heal, for some of the splintered bones had caused wounds that were now well festered, and a dangerous blue line had begun to form along the man’s leg. Therefore, one morning when the grating was opened to haul up the slop bucket, one of the Punti men swung himself aloft with the intention of asking the sailors for help, but when they saw his ominous yellow face and the long pigtail appearing on deck, they panicked and began to shout, “Mutiny! Mutiny!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The first mate came rushing forward, grabbing a pin as he ran, and Captain Hoxworth left the bridge, leaping swiftly down the ladders onto the deck. By this time one of the sailors had swung a powerful fist at the startled Punti, knocking him toward the first mate, who brought his pin down across the man’s skull with full force. This knocked the Chinese unconscious and into the path of the onrushing captain, who, when he saw the fallen mutineer, began to kick him in the face, driving his heavy leather shoes into the inert man’s cheekbones until there was a sickly collapse of the man’s facial structure.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the terror ended, the captain shouted to his sailors, “You, there! Throw this damned pirate back into the hold.” Two sailors grabbed the inert Punti and tossed him headfirst down the opening.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Goddamnit!” Hoxworth shouted in frustration. “We should never have sailed without someone who can speak Chinee.” He stormed for a moment, then commanded: “Mister Aspinwall, fetch the guns.” When they were produced, Hoxworth directed his men to fire into the bulkheads over the cowering Chinese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t ever try to mutiny my ship!” Hoxworth stormed, cursing the coolies and stalking back to his bridge.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was met there by an ashen-faced Dr. Whipple, who demanded bitterly, “Was such brutality necessary, Captain Hoxworth?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall seafarer, fleshy and prosperous, stared ahead over the prow of his ship and said, “John, you’d better keep out of this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t be a partner to such brutality,” the gray-haired doctor said firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You afraid of blood?” Hoxworth asked. “Or afraid of losing your investment?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple refused to acknowledge this insulting query, and continued as if he had not heard it: “As a Christian I cannot tolerate your behavior toward men I conscripted in good faith.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The older man continued conning his ship and said calmly, “Dr. Whipple, how many vessels do you think were mutinied last year by Chinee pirates who smuggled themselves aboard?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” Whipple replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Eleven,” Captain Hoxworth said evenly. “That is, eleven that we know about. We haven’t the remotest knowledge of what’s lurking in that hold. Pirates . . . cutthroats . . . mutineers. You guess. All I’m saying is, that a Hoxworth &amp; Hale ship is never going to be mutinied by any Chinee. That’s why I personally supervised this little adventure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But to kick an unconscious man!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dr. Whipple, I respect your principles. I like the way you carry out your business. But in my business, the minute a captain is either afraid or unwilling to kick his enemy to a pulp, he’s on the verge of losing his ship. I have nineteen ships now, and I don’t propose to lose a damned one of them to a bunch of murderous Chinamen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple studied these remarks in silence, then moved to the doorway leading from the bridge. In resolute, unhurried words he said, “Captain, although I respect your fears, I must dissociate myself from your actions. They were brutal and indefensible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The doctor considered this statement a morally crushing one and left the bridge, but big Captain Hoxworth bounded after him, caught him by the arm, swung him around, and growled, “Once a missionary, always a missionary. Doctor, you-don’t know a goddamned thing about running a ship, and you ought to keep your nose out of it. This is not work for a missionary. It’s work for a man.” Shoving Whipple away in contempt, he stalked back to the bridge, from which he ran his ship and from which, figuratively, he ran his entire line of prosperous vessels.</p>

  <p class="normal">John Whipple did not allow his anger at such treatment to obscure his judgment. In years of trading around the Pacific he had often met obstinate men and the cruel situations which they produce, and he had learned that in such confrontations his only chance of winning lay in doing exactly what in conscience ought to be done. It was by reliance upon this conviction that he had quietly made his way in such disparate jungles as Valparaiso, Batavia, Singapore and Honolulu. Now he went calmly to his cabin, next door to the one where the captain had kept the two young Chinese girls during the Hong Kong layover, and took up his doctor’s kit. Checking it as he had learned to do more than forty years before, he carried it sedately to the locked grating and said to the sailor on guard, “Open it and let me in.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The captain would . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Open it,” Whipple commanded. “There’s a man dying down there.” And he took a belaying pin and started knocking away the wedges that held the grating in place. When it had swung free, he saw that no ladder could be fitted into it, so he held his bag between his knees, grabbed the edge of the opening, and swung himself down into the stinking hold. “What a horrible smell!” he mumbled through clenched teeth as he joined the three hundred and one Chinese.</p>

  <p class="normal">Compared to the brightness of the day on deck, all was gloom and shadowy darkness in the hold, and as his eyes slowly became accustomed to the tenebrous hell, and his nose to its rankness, he saw that two men lay stretched out in the middle near where he had landed, while the others stood huddled in two clearly separated groups. He thought: “They will be the Punti and the Hakka.” And he could not be certain when they might leap at him, as in justice they were entitled to do. But each of three hundred had seen him before, in the villages, and therefore he seemed like an old friend, which he now proceeded to prove he was.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ignoring both the uncertainty and the danger of his position, he knelt beside the man whose face had been kicked in, checked the extent of damage, and spread beside him objects that the Chinese could see were medicines. Carefully, by keeping one thumb pressed inside the unconscious man’s mouth, first at one place and then at another, he began to mold the bones back into line, thinking: “It’s merciful that he is still insensible.” He next medicated the open wounds where the heavy boot had cut the skin and saw with some pleasure that the man’s eyes were not badly damaged. Looking up at the circle of inquisitive faces, he communicated his real joy at this discovery, and the Chinese understood.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point, Nyuk Tsin came to him and directed his attention to the man with the broken ankle, and he studied with admiration the splint made of chopsticks. Again he demonstrated his approval, and again everyone understood, so that Nyuk Tsin gained even greater acceptance than she had before enjoyed. But it was also apparent to Dr. Whipple that the injured Chinese could well lose his leg unless quick remedies were effected, so he shouted through the grating, “Send me down some hot water, right away.” But when the sailor opened the grating, everyone below could hear the captain’s great voice shouting, “Who in the hell ordered you to touch that grating?” And the sailor replied, “Dr. Whipple is down there tending the sick Chinese.” There was a moment of ominous silence, the sound of heavy feet striding across the foredeck, and an echoing slap across someone’s face, followed by a deluge of scalding water down the grating.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s his hot water, by God! And I’ll teach you to open a grating!” There were ugly sounds, such as the Chinese had heard before, but this time, looking at Whipple amongst them, they could be sure that it was an American who was receiving a beating.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, in the mournful semi-darkness, a face that could not be clearly discerned pressed close to the grating and bellowed, “John Whipple, are you down there with those goddamned Chinee pirates?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am giving them medical care,” Whipple said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, if you love the Chinee so much, you can stay down there!” and he ordered the new sailors who assumed the grating-watch: “If he makes a single move to get out, bash him in the face with a board.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the next hour John Whipple made one of the two or three fundamental discoveries of his long and scientific life. He found that men of good will who could understand not a single word of the other’s language, could nevertheless communicate with reasonable accuracy and with profound perceptions that were neither logic nor sentiment. If a man wanted strongly enough to be understood, he was, and before sixty minutes had passed, Dr. Whipple had somehow explained to both the Hakka and the Punti that the damaged ankle could be saved if he could use their sparse reserves of water, that the unconscious man need not die, that the slop buckets should have the rim washed each day with the remnants of what water was left, and that only one section of wall away from the wind should be used for urinating, whether the man was a Hakka or a Punti, and when in the late afternoon it came time for him to urinate, he used that designated spot and saw with some satisfaction that the urine ran quickly out of the hold along a break in the floor. He smelled the area closely and concluded, “With this heat it’ll be horrible in two days, but better than before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To punish the mutineers for actions which, in Hoxworth’s opinion as he reported in his log, could well have led to the loss of the Carthaginian, no food or water was passed down through the grating that day, nor was the slop bucket hauled up, and as twilight fell and the card games ceased, John Whipple settled down for his first long night of hell in the crowded hold, but as he prepared to lie upon the bare boards, Nyuk Tsin moved among the Hakka men and found a few extra cloths. Vermin had already begun breeding in the rags, but Whipple used them and thanked their owners. But the smell of the hold nauseated him.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not until four o’clock the following afternoon that the grate was opened and some water sent down, and Whipple was astonished at the sensible discipline imposed at this moment by the gasping Chinese. Kee Mun Ki stood forth as the leader of the Punti, and a tall, rugged man as spokesman for the Hakka, and the water was justly divided and apportioned, after which Dr. Whipple shouted, “Will you send down four more buckets of water, please?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a hushed convocation aloft to consider this request and after a moment the heavy sound of boots. Through the grating Captain Hoxworth shouted, “What is it you want?”</p>

  <p class="normal">We require four more buckets of water,” Whipple replied evenly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you require and what you get are two different matters,” Hoxworth stormed. “I’m dealing with a mutiny.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you have your men haul up the slops?” Whipple pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Hoxworth replied, and marched off.</p>

  <p class="normal">During the second awful night there was both hunger and acute suffering from lack of water, but Dr. Whipple explained to the Chinese that Captain Hoxworth was mentally unbalanced and that everyone, including Whipple, must be careful not to exasperate him. The stench was worse that night, if possible, for not much breeze came through the grating, but next morning four extra buckets of water were sent down and some food. When Whipple was given his share, his stomach revolted and he thought: “Good God! Do we serve them this? To eat?” The long day passed, and Dr. Whipple, unable to occupy himself merely by tending the broken ankle and the crushed jaw, found himself thinking: “No one who journeys to a distant land ever has it easy. Things were better on the Thetis, but were they really much better? At least in the Pacific there isn’t constant seasickness. Now if this were the Atlantic . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the Chinese, in these same empty hours, were thinking: “I’ll bet a rich American like this one never knew such things before.” And although Whipple and his Chinese friends could talk about many things, on this fundamental fact of emigration they could never communicate. Even when each had the full vocabulary of the other, this basic fact of brotherhood—that all have known misery—could not be shared, for just as Abner Hale had refused to believe that the Polynesians had suffered heroic privation in getting to Hawaii, so the Chinese of the Carthaginian would never accept the fact that the wealthy white man had known tribulation too.</p>

  <p class="normal">The day droned on. The smells lessened when Dr. Whipple showed the men how he wanted the slop bucket washed down. It helped, too, when he sloshed a full bucket of water in the urinal corner. The man with the broken face moaned less often, and the ominous red streaks up the groin of the other sick man diminished. There were card games and some shouting among the Punti over an incident which Whipple did not understand, and suddenly Mun Ki rose and announced something, whereupon he and his wife started hanging rude blankets across a corner of the hold.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Goodness!” Dr. Whipple said to himself when he discovered what the contrivance was for. And the meaningless day passed into meaningless night. But before the light vanished, the grating was kicked aside and Captain Hoxworth shouted abruptly, “You ready to come up, Whipple?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I brought these people aboard this ship,” the doctor said quietly. “I’ll stay with them till the sores are healed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“As you wish. Here’s some bread.” And a loaf of bread banged down into the hold. The Chinese, to whom Whipple offered some, did not like it, but Whipple observed that it was mainly the Hakka who were willing to try something new.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the third day the grating was kicked aside, some of the boards of the hatch covering were removed, and a ladder was thrust down into the hold. Armed sailors stood guard as Dr. Whipple slowly climbed up and adjusted his eyes to bright daylight. Before he departed, the Chinese signified that they were sorry to see him go, and he replied that he would send them more water and better food. Then the boards were hammered home again.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple’s meeting with Captain Hoxworth was a painful one. For the first two hours the captain avoided him, but at lunch they had to meet, and Whipple said flatly, “Rafer, we have got to give those people more water.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will,” Hoxworth grunted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And they must have better food.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“At the price we agreed to haul them, Doctor, that’s impossible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It isn’t impossible to keep filth out of the rice.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our cook ain’t trained in this Chinee stuff, Doctor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s got to feed them better.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not at these prices,” Hoxworth replied stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple, now sixty-six, was afraid of very little, and without throwing down a blunt challenge, observed: “Two days ago you accused me of being a missionary. It’s been many years since I thought of myself as such, but as I grow older I’m increasingly proud to accept the charge. I am a missionary. I’ve always been one. And, Rafer, do you know the truly damnable thing about a missionary?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth suspected that he was being challenged by a man at least as smart as he was, and replied cautiously, “I think I know the worst about missionaries.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Captain, you don’t, because if you did you would never treat me as you have the past two days. You have never learned the one respect in which missionaries must be feared.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They write.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They what?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They write. They have an absolute mania for taking pen in hand and writing a book, or a memorial, or a series of letters to the newspapers.” Icily he stared at the big sea captain and said, “Rafer, I have never written, yet, of what I think of the way you treated Abner Hale, your partner’s father, because that was a personal thing and could possibly be excused. But unless you feed these Chinese better, when we get to Honolulu I am going to write. I am going to write a series of letters, Rafer, that will forever cast a stigma upon the blue flag that you love so well. Whenever an H &amp; H ship puts into port, someone will have heard about those letters. Because missionaries have one terrible power, Rafer. They write. They are the conscience of the Pacific.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an ominous silence, broken finally by Hoxworth’s slamming his fist onto the table till the dishes rattled. “Why, goddamn it, this is nothing but blackmail.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” Whipple agreed. “Blackmail is the only refuge of the literate man against barbarism. And you’re a barbarian, Rafer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it you want?” the captain growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Twice as much rice a day. And decent meat. Water three times a day. The slop bucket to come up three times a day. And I will be free to go down into the hold once a day to check the sick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will not run the risk of having this ship mutinied,” Hoxworth stormed. “I will not uncover that hold till we reach Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll go down through the grating,” Whipple countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll get back as best you can,” Hoxworth warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Chinese will lift me back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You seem very fond of . . .” Hoxworth did not finish this insult but asked confidentially, “Tell me, Doctor, what’s happening with that Chinee girl? Do them men take turns?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s the wife of one man,” Whipple replied coldly. “They live in one corner of the hold.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell me, does this man, well, does he . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Behind a sheet which he hangs from the bulkhead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, I’ll be damned!” the captain mused. “You wouldn’t find three hundred American sailors letting a man get away with anything like that. No, sir!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe the Chinese are more civilized,” Whipple said and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was with pride that he accompanied the first additional ration of water into the hold. He was there when the improved food came down, and by this time the awful stench had abated somewhat, for he had taken upon himself the job of setting the deck sail properly so as to wash fresh air down into the noisome hold. The poison was now abated from the broken ankle, and the second man’s face was healing. Some of the Punti, directed by Whipple, were fraternizing with the Hakka, and Mun Ki, on one special day toward the end of the voyage, actually wanted Nyuk Tsin for herself alone, and not because he had been daydreaming of his naked Kung wife. He was finding Nyuk Tsin a most pleasurable and hard-working woman.</p>

  <p class="normal">On one particularly hot day the Chinese were startled to hear a terrifying sound forward, as of chains running out, and they thought some disaster had overtaken them, for they knew nothing of ships, but it immediately became apparent that the motion of the Carthaginian had ceased; at last the ship was home. After much coming and going on deck, the boards covering the hold were knocked away and the ladder was dropped down. One by one the Chinese climbed back into daylight, rubbed their eyes in pain, and gradually saw the white shoreline of Honolulu, the palm trees, the distant majesty of Diamond Head, and far behind the flat land the mountains rising green and blue and purple, shrouded in misty storms. As was customary on almost each day of the year, a rainbow hung in the valleys, and the Chinese thought this a particularly good omen to mark their arrival at the Fragrant Tree Country. How beautiful, how exceedingly marvelous the land seemed that day.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were others, too, who felt that the arrival of the Carthaginian was a good omen, for the Honolulu Mail carried a report which stated: “We are told on good authority that Whipple &amp; Janders, utilizing the H &amp; H schooner Carthaginian, will shortly be depositing in Honolulu a new cargo of more than three hundred Celestials destined for the sugar fields. These able-bodied hands, for we have been assured that Dr. John Whipple went personally to China to secure only strong young males—many of them Hakka this time—will be available on five-year contracts at the rate of $3 cash a month, food and board, plus three Chinese holidays a year. At the end of ten or fifteen years of work in our fields, it is confidently expected that the Chinese will return to their homeland, especially since they have not brought their own women with them, and it can hardly be supposed that they will find any here.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sugar men who have already utilized Chinese on our plantations say this of them. For all kinds of work they are infinitely superior to the shiftless Hawaiians. They eat less, obey better, are not subject to illness, are more clever in mastering new jobs, make fine carpenters when trained, and have a noticeable affinity for agricultural life. The employer must be stern, not beat them too often, and above all must not show signs of vacillation, for like all Orientals, the Chinese respect and love those who exercise a firm authority and despise those who do not.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are fortunate in acquiring such admirable workmen for our plantations and we are sure that after these industrious Chinese have worked out their terms and have saved their wages, they will return to China, leaving in these islands an enviable reputation for industriousness while taking back to China wealth they could not otherwise have dreamed of. The sugar industry welcomes these Celestials, and we feel confident that the true prosperity of our islands will date from this day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On such truly amicable terms the Chinese went ashore at the Fragrant Tree Country, but in their disembarkation there was this profound difference among them: the Punti thought: “This will be a good home for five years, and then I will see the Low Village again,” and no Punti had this determination to a greater degree than Kee Mun Ki; but the Hakka thought: “This is a good land to make a home in, and we shall never leave,” and no Hakka thought this more strongly than Char Nyuk Tsin.</p>

  <p class="normal">If the Chinese sometimes irritated Hawaii by refusing to call the new land anything but the Fragrant Tree Country, the islands retaliated in a rather striking manner. Inside the hot customs shed an immigration official was shouting, “All right! Attention! All Pakes over here!” No one moved, so he shouted again, this time pronouncing the word slowly: “Pa-kays, over here.” Again there was no response, so he yelled, “You Chinks! Line up!”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was said that when the first Chinese landed in Hawaii the islanders asked them, “What shall we call you?” And the most sedate of the travelers replied, “It would be proper if you called me Pak Yeh.” which meant Older Uncle. And from that time on, the Chinese were called Pakes.</p>

  <p class="normal">As it came Kee Mun Ki’s turn to face the interpreters he trembled, for he knew that soon he must make a fundamental decision concerning the Hakka girl Char Nyuk Tsin, but any perplexity over her was driven from his mind when an official, a large Hawaiian with a few phrases of Chinese, scowled at the man in front of Kee Mun Ki and growled, “What’s your name?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Punti stood silent in fear, so the huge Hawaiian shouted, “What’s your name?” Still the man remained awe-struck, so that a Chinese scholar employed for the purpose hurried up and said in good Punti, “Tell the man your name.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Leong Ah Kam,” the Chinese replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Which of the names is the important one,” the Hawaiian asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Leong,” the interpreter explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How’d you spell it?” the Hawaiian asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well,” the scholarly interpreter hedged, “in English this name Leong is rather difficult. It could be made into Lung or Long or Ling or Liong or Lyong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The big official studied the problem for a moment. “Lung sounds silly,” he growled, not because he was angry at the Chinese standing before him but because he was bedeviled by this constant problem of finding names for immigrant Chinese. Suddenly his face brightened into a generous smile and he pointed a big, pudgy finger at the laborer Leong Ah Kam, and fastening upon the last two names, he announced: “From now on your real name is Akama. And don’t you forget it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Carefully he printed the name on a white card: “This man’s official name is L. Akama.” It was in this manner that the Chinese got their Hawaiian names. Ah Kong became Akona. Ah Ki became Akina, and sometimes the simple Ah Pake, The Honorable Chinese, became Apaka. As in the past, Hawaii still modified all things that came to it, and the Punti laborer Leong Ah Kam became L. Akama.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was now Kee Mun Ki’s turn, and when the interpreter asked him his name he said firmly, “Kee Mun Ki, and I want to be known as Kee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did he say?” the Hawaiian asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He said that he wished to be known as Kee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How would you spell it?” the Hawaiian asked. When he heard the reply he tested the name several times, found it satisfactory, and printed: “This man’s official name is Kee Mun Ki,” and the tricky little gambler felt that he had won a victory. But before he had time to savor it, he was faced by two new problems, for outside the fence of the immigration area a thin, sharp-eyed Chinese was calling in whispers to him, and the young gambler knew by instinct that this was a man he did not wish to see; but the calling continued and Mun Ki had to move toward the fence.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you the one who brought the girl?” the wiry man asked in Punti.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Mun Ki replied honestly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“From the Brothel of Spring Nights?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank the gods!” the nervous visitor sighed. “I need a new girl badly. It looks like she’s a Hakka.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She is,” Mun Ki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Damn!” the visitor snapped. “Did he knock off the price? Her being a Hakka?’’</p>

  <p class="normal">“There is no price,” Mun Ki said carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wiry man’s face grew stern. “What?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to keep her for myself,” Mun Ki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You thief! You robber!” The man outside began to make such a protest that officials came up on the inside of the fence and shouted at him. “That is my girl!” the infuriated Punti shrieked, forgetful of the fact that he was incriminating himself. One of the Punti interpreters called a Hakka clerk and together they addressed Char Nyuk Tsin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The man outside says that you were sold to him,” the Hakka interpreter explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What man?” Nyuk Tsin asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That small, nervous man,” the official replied, and from the manner of the questioning, and from the look of the excited little man, and from the great embarrassment of her husband, Nyuk Tsin slowly realized that she had been brought to Hawaii to be sold into a house no different from the Brothel of Spring Nights. She could feel once more the ropes about her wrists, and although it had been some weeks since she recalled the hideous nights with her kidnapers, she could now remember. She did not panic, but with real courage fought down the terror that welled into her throat. Brushing aside the Hakka interpreter, she went boldly to Mun Ki and stood before him so that he would have to look at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">His downcast eyes saw her big feet, her strong body, her capable hands and finally her unpretty but appealing face. He looked directly in her eyes for some moments and thought: “She is worth whatever she may cost. This one can work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And with a clear voice, whose words Nyuk Tsin could understand, Mun Ki said, “This girl is not for sale. She is my wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">No Hawaiians or Americans had so far become involved in this quarrel between two Chinese men, and as always the various interpreters were determined that the misunderstanding be settled within the Chinese community. So the Punti interpreter said, “That’s all very well, but the man outside says he paid fifty dollars for this girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is correct,” Mun Ki said. “And I will give him my own fifty dollars.” He untied his wedding belt, dipped down into a pouch that his Kung wife had embroidered for him, and produced fifty Mexican dollars. It was like giving up part of his immortal spirit for Mun Ki the gambler to surrender these dollars, for he had intended to multiply them many times, but he passed them through the fence.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s better to handle everything among ourselves,” the Punti official whispered, but the brothel proprietor began screaming that he had been robbed of an important asset, whereupon Mun Ki leaped to the fence, thrust his right arm through and caught the nervous little man by the neck.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will thrash you!” he cried. “I owed you money and like an honest man I have paid it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s going on over here?” Dr. Whipple called.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing,” the Chinese officials blandly replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You, out there? What’s the fighting about?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Me no fight!” the brothel keeper exclaimed, looking astonished that anyone should have thought that he was involved in trouble.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What name did they give you?” Whipple asked Mun Ki. “Let’s see the paper. Yes, Mun Ki. That’s a fine name. Sounds Hawaiian. Interpreter, will you tell this man that I would like to have him and his wife work for me. Ask him if he can cook.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can you cook?” the Punti asked Mun Ki.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was the best cook in the best brothel in Macao,” the gambler replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think the American missionary would understand,” the Punti thought. To Whipple he said, “The man says he can cook.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Explain to him that if he works on the sugar plantations he earns three dollars a month, but as a cook boy only two dollars. His wife gets fifty cents a month. But there are many advantages.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” Mun Ki asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You learn English. You become skilled. And you live in town, so that if later you want to open a store . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll be your cook,” Mun Ki said, for although the explanations given by Whipple were interesting, the young gambler had swiftly foreseen an additional advantage that outweighed all the rest: in the city he would be closer to the big gambling games.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was for these reasons that Kee Mun Ki and his Hakka wife Nyuk Tsin became the household servants of the Dr. John Whipples; but as the Chinese stooped to recover their luggage, Mun Ki taking the light bedroll and Nyuk Tsin the heavy tub and basket, she saw tied to the latter the rope with which she had been lashed up in the Brothel of Spring Nights, and it reminded her that it was the quick, clever man who walked ahead who had saved her from such things and who, with his own cherished gold pieces, had purchased her freedom. So as she tagged along behind him, weighed down with burdens, she thought: “May that good man have a hundred sons.”</p>

  <p class="normal">ON&#160; <span>CLOSER INSPECTION</span>, Honolulu of 1865 proved far less glamorous than its physical setting. Because Hawaii could provide no lumber, nor skilled stonemasons to work the product of its quarries, the houses of the city were meanly built, each foot of timber being conserved for practical rather than aesthetic use. Buildings were therefore low, formless and hastily put together. In the central area they crowded in upon each other and were usually not painted. Streets were unpaved and very dusty, and although a few business thoroughfares had rude sidewalks made of granite ballast hauled from China, in most areas pedestrians had to use the fringes of the road. There were, however, a good police force and an active fire department, but judging from the numerous scars that showed where flames had gutted whole rows of attached buildings, the latter seemed to enjoy only a modest success.</p>

  <p class="normal">Business establishments occupied big rambling buildings, often made of brick carried as ballast from England, and stores sprawled aimlessly over many haphazard counters. At the corner of Fort and Merchant streets in a bright new brick building distinguished by green cast-iron shutters, Janders &amp; Whipple had the town’s largest emporium, but the most impressive commercial building stood on an opposite corner: Hoxworth &amp; Hale’s huge shipping headquarters. Sharp-eyed Mun Ki, comparing Honolulu’s grubby appearance with the grandeur of Canton, where impressive stone buildings lined the waterfronts, was frankly disappointed in the contrast.</p>

  <p class="normal">Meanwhile, other Punti from the Carthaginian were discovering that the lush tropical growth of the island was confined to the inaccessible mountains, whereas the land on which they were to work was really more bleak and barren than that which they had fled in China. This depressed them and they thought: “Uncle Chun Fat lied to us. Not even a Chinese can make his fortune on such a barren island.” Out of a hundred average fields surrounding Honolulu, not less than ninety were desert, for on them no rain fell. The vast acreages west of Honolulu, which belonged to the Hoxworth family through inheritance from the last Alii Nui, Noelani, were practically worthless, thirsting for water. But scattered across the island there were small valleys in which an occasional bubbling stream fed the fields, and here the Chinese were put to work. Some grew rice for the booming California market. Others worked on small sugar plantations. A few lucky men were taught to ride horses, and became cowboys on the parched rangelands, and many were put to work growing vegetables; but as they started their new tasks, each man carried in his memory an exciting picture of Honolulu’s close-packed streets and dusty enterprise, and all thought: “I’ve got to get back to Honolulu. That’s where the life is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hawaii’s reception of the Chinese was somewhat dampened by Captain Rafer Hoxworth’s frightening account of his heroic escape from mutiny, and the newspapers were peppered with predictions from other seafaring men that Honolulu had entered upon a period of maximum danger, when the possibility of an armed Chinese uprising, with all white men murdered in their beds by slinking Celestial fiends, was a distinct possibility. Captain Hoxworth volunteered several interviews with the press in which he contended that only his swift reaction to the first attempts at mutiny had preserved his ship, and thereafter he became known as the intrepid captain who had quelled the Chinese mutiny.</p>

  <p class="normal">The friends of Dr. John Whipple were therefore apprehensive when the doctor took into his home the Kees to serve as cook and maid, and men stopped him several times on the street to ask, “Do you think it wise, John, to harbor in your home such criminal characters?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t find them criminal,” Whipple responded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“After the mutiny?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What mutiny?” he always asked dryly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The one that Rafer Hoxworth put down on the Carthaginian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple never openly refuted the captain’s story, for he knew that what is mutiny to one man is not to another and it was his nature to make generous allowances, but he often did observe sardonically: “Even very brave men sometimes see ghosts.” He was content to have the Kees working for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the day of their arrival Dr. Whipple piled their luggage into his dray and then led his two servants on foot leisurely up Nuuanu Street toward his home, and although he could not speak Chinese, he explained the structure of the city to the young couple. “The first street we cross is Queen, Queen, Queen.” He stopped and drew a little map in the dust and made them repeat the name of the cross street. At first they failed to understand what he was doing, so deftly he drew a ship and pointed back to the Carthaginian, and immediately they caught on, for it was Dr. Whipple’s conviction that any man not an imbecile could be taught almost anything.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Merchant, King, Hotel,” he explained. Then he left big Nuuanu Street and took a detour to the comer of Merchant and Fort to show his Chinese the J &amp; W store. “This is where I work,” he said, and his servants were impressed, the more so when he picked up several bolts of dark cloth and handed them to Nyuk Tsin.</p>

  <a id="section_1"></a>

  <p class="normal">Finally, he came to the broad east-west street named in honor of Great Britain, Beretania, and when he had taught the Chinese how to say that important name, he showed them that they stood on the corner of Nuuanu and Beretania. They understood, and then he pointed to a substantial picket fence that surrounded a large property on the ocean-western corner, and when he had reviewed with them just where this stood, he opened the gate and said, “This will be your home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They smiled, three people with three different languages, and the Chinese looked in awe at the Whipple homestead. Set amid three acres of land, it was built on coral blocks and consisted of a large one-story wooden building completely surrounded by a very wide porch. All interior rooms were thus dark and cool and were accessible to the veranda. The coral base of the house was masked by luxuriant croton plants, recently brought to Hawaii by the captain of an H &amp; H ship, and these produced large varicolored leaves, iridescent in rain or sunlight, so that the sprawling house nestled in tropic beauty.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple called, and from the front door his wife appeared, a small, white-haired New England woman wearing an apron. She hurried across the porch and onto the lawn, extending her hands to the Chinese. “This is my wife,” Dr. Whipple explained formally, “and this is the cook Mun Ki and the maid Mrs. Kee.” Everyone bowed and Mrs. Whipple said, “I should like to show you to your new home,” and she demonstrated how the Whipple dining room stood at the rear of the big wooden house, and how there was a covered runway from it to an outside kitchen, where all the food was cooked, and another runway leading off to a small wooden house, and this was to be theirs. She pushed open the door and showed them a compact, clean room, which she herself had dusted that morning. Leading off from it was another, and while they stood there conversing they knew not how, the dray arrived with their luggage and stores of food, utensils and bedding.</p>

  <p class="normal">“These are for you,” Mrs. Whipple said warmly, taking Nyuk Tsin’s hand and leading her to the boxes. That afternoon one of the Hewlett women asked, “Amanda, how will your Chinese learn to cook if they can’t understand a word you say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’ll learn,” Amanda replied forcefully, for she shared her husband’s New England conviction that human beings had brains; so for the first four weeks of their employment, the Kees went to school. Little Amanda Whipple was up at five, teaching Mun Ki how to cook American style, and she was impressed both with his clever mind and his fearful stubbornness. For example, on each Friday during the past four decades it had been Amanda’s ritual to make the family yeast, and for the first two Fridays, Mun Ki studied to see how she performed this basic function in American cookery. He watched her grate the potato into a stone jar of almost sacred age and add a little salt and a lot of sugar, after which she poured in boiling water, allowing all to cool. Then, ceremoniously, she ladled in two tablespoonfuls of active yeast made the Friday before, and the strain continued. For forty-three years Amanda had kept one family of yeast alive, and to it she attributed her success as a cook. She was therefore appalled on Mun Ki’s third Friday to enter the cookhouse full of ritualistic fervor, only to find the stone jar already filled with next week’s yeast.</p>

  <p class="normal">With tears in her eyes, she started to storm at Mun Ki, and he patiently listened for some minutes, then got mad. Flashing his pigtail about the kitchen he shouted that any fool could learn to make yeast in one week. He had been courteous and had studied for two weeks and now he wanted her out of the kitchen. Not understanding a word he was saying, she continued to mourn for the lost yeast, so he firmly grabbed her shoulders and ejected her onto the lawn. On Monday the new batch of yeast was as good as ever and she consoled herself philosophically: “It’s the same strain, sent forward by different hands.” Suddenly, she felt the elderly white-haired woman she was.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki also had difficulty understanding why Americans ate so much, and he would consistently omit dishes to which the robust appetites of the white men had become accustomed. A typical Whipple dinner, served at high noon in the heat of the day, consisted of fish chowder, roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, creamed cabbage cooked in ham fat, delicious chewy biscuits made of taro and drenched in butter, mashed potatoes, candied yams, pickled mango, alligator pear salad with heavy dressing, French bread with guava jelly, banana pie marvelously thick and rich, followed by coffee with cream, and cigars. If guests were present, two extra vegetables were served and French brandy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, the Chinese would eat steamed cabbage with no fat, a little fish cooked with soybean sauce, a bowl of rice and some unsweetened tea, and it was often remarked that Hawaii must agree with the Orientals, because even though they worked harder than the white men, they lived longer.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she finished supervising the preparation of food, little Amanda Whipple, in her sixties, turned her attention to Nyuk Tsin and taught the hard-working Chinese girl how to care for a large house. Dusting was particularly stressed and caused some difficulty, because in China, Nyuk Tsin’s mother had waited for a likely omen before bothering to dust, whereas energetic Mrs. Whipple demanded that it be done regularly every day. The floors had to be dusted, the flowered china lamps, the chandelier, the rosewood love seat with its multiple curlicues, the endless embroidered decorations, the peacock chair from Canton and the bamboo furniture that never looked clean. Nyuk Tsin’s special nightmare was the great fish net on the parlor wall from which shells, leis and other keepsakes were hung. In fact, there was scarcely an inch of the Whipple house that did not contain some gimcrack whose main purpose was gathering dust.</p>

  <p class="normal">In comparison, the Kee household contained one table bearing the genealogy book, a flint lighter, a candle and a wine bottle. There was also a rope bed above which hung the impressive sign: “May This Bed Yield a Hundred Sons.”</p>

  <p class="normal">According to the agreement reached by Whipple and his Chinese, Mun Ki received two dollars a month and his wife was to have received fifty cents, but when Mrs. Whipple saw how excellent Nyuk Tsin’s work was, from five in the morning till nine at night, seven days a week, her generosity was touched, so she paid the girl a full dollar each month, and from this salary of $36 a year the two Chinese were required to clothe themselves, pay for the birth and education of their children, provide for entertainment and luxuries, and send money home to the official wife in China. They did all these things, but their problems were eased a bit by the unnecessary generosity of the Whipples. Unexpected gifts here and there added to the family treasury, and the allotment of an acre of good land which Nyuk Tsin could farm for herself allowed the couple to earn some real money, for Nyuk Tsin was a fine farmer and soon appeared on the streets of Honolulu with a bamboo pole across her shoulders and two baskets of fresh vegetables slung from the ends. She hawked her wares mainly among the Chinese, accumulating from them a growing store of American dimes, Australian shillings, and Spanish reals, for Hawaii had wisely decided that any of the world’s money could circulate freely within the kingdom.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Kee funds were further augmented by some shrewd enterprise on the husband’s part, for each day as soon as breakfast was finished, he hurried down to Nuuanu Street, to Chinatown, where nondescript shacks huddled together in ugly profusion and where white men rarely went. His destination was a particularly disreputable hovel in which sat an elderly Chinese with wispy beard and a brush and book in which he entered bets as they were offered. Behind him, on the wall, hung a luridly colored sketch of a man, with twenty-eight parts of his body indicated: nose, ankle, knee, elbow . . . The game which had captured Mun Ki’s whole imagination consisted of placing a bet as to which of these words would appear in the sealed capsule that stood under a glass on the table before the game’s operator. Most of the Chinese in Hawaii played the game, at odds of thirty to one, which gave the player an advantage, except that if there were too many winners the prize was proportionately lowered; the bank never lost. Nevertheless, the odds were enticing, and each day upon rising, families would inquire of one another: “Did you dream of an elbow last night?” Careful attention was also paid to any sudden pain, or to an accident involving any part of the body. But mostly it was dreams that brought good fortune, and it was uncanny how the dreams of Mun Ki kept pointing the way to the lucky word.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You were again with the winning word?” the game’s manager asked sourly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Today it’s bound to be chin,” Mun Ki assured him. “I woke last night with my chin itching furiously, and I can read through the glass and see the word written on the paper.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much are you betting?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two dimes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The proprietor’s face betrayed his displeasure as he brushed the entry into his book. “You’re a clever man, Mun Ki,” he grumbled. “Why don’t you join me in this business?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m a cook,” Mun Ki replied. “It’s better to win from you than work for you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I have in mind,” the older gambler proposed, “is for you to collect bets at the far end of town and bring them in here by ten each morning.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then, I couldn’t bet for myself, could I?” Mun Ki asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, then you’d be part of the game.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From one of the towers along the waterfront a clock struck eleven, people crowded in from the alleys of Chinatown, the excitement grew intense, and the proprietor ceremoniously lifted away the glass to uncover the capsule. To prevent the quick substitution of a word on which no one had bet that day—a trick that had often been tried in the past—a man was selected at random, and under the most careful scrutiny he opened the capsule and shouted: “Chin!” Mun Ki leaped with joy and cried, “I had two dimes bet, because I woke with a definite itch on my chin.” He explained to everyone the precise minute at which he had wakened and his thoughts at that propitious moment. With his two dimes and his dream he had won two months’ normal wages.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was about to leave the gambling shack when the old proprietor caught his arm and said, “You ought to join me. Today you made, a lot of money, but I make it every day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You do?” Mun Ki asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Every day. If too many win, I cut the prize. I send hundreds of dollars back to China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could I?” the young gambler asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Easily. If you worked with me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in this way that the cookhouse of the missionary home at Nuuanu and Beretania became one of the principal outposts of the chi-fa word game. Mun Ki kept on hand a supply of gaudy posters which showed twenty-eight parts of the human body that might be named; and for each bet he took he got six per cent from the bank and fifteen per cent of the prize money from the winner, if the ticket won; and he became one of the chi-fa’s best operators, for as he had proved by paying the brothel operator full price for Nyuk Tsin, he was meticulously honest with both his employer and his customers. His chief return, however, came from his happy idea of having the chi-fa poster printed in Hawaiian and in enlisting dozens of native gamblers. They enjoyed doing business with him, and bought so many tickets that soon there were chi-fa drawings both at eleven and at four. With the money he made, Mun Ki slipped away two or three afternoons a week for the wild fan-tan and mah-jongg games that ran uninterruptedly in Chinatown. He was a fierce competitor, and his store of dimes and reals and shillings grew steadily.</p>

  <p class="normal">The only disagreement the Kees had with the Whipples occurred when it became obvious that Nyuk Tsin was going to have a baby. For some months she had hidden the fact behind her loose smock, so that when Mrs. Whipple finally did discover it she said, “You must do no more housework, Mrs. Kee. Rest.” But that same afternoon she saw Nyuk Tsin trudging down Nuuanu with two huge baskets of vegetables at the ends of her bamboo pole. Amanda stopped her carriage, climbed down, and commanded her maid to drop the burden and wait till Mun Ki could be sent to pick it up; but when the cook arrived he studied the situation in astonishment and said, “Swinging the bamboo pole is the best thing a pregnant woman can do. It gets her ready.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Dr. Whipple went out to the Chinese house and said, “I’ll make arrangements to deliver the baby.” He was disturbed when Mun Ki explained in the little English he had picked up: “No need doctor. I bring baby.” It was a rather difficult point to argue, since neither man was proficient in the other’s language, but Dr. Whipple got the distinct impression that Mun Ki was arguing: “In China husbands always deliver their wives’ babies. Who else?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think I’d better get an interpreter,” the confused doctor interrupted. He went to fetch the scholarly man who served as unofficial Chinese consul, and explained: “I’m afraid my servant here is intending to deliver his wife himself.” “Why not?” the consul asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s preposterous! I’m a doctor, living right here.” Then, fearing that perhaps money might be the problem, he assured the consul: “I’ll do it without charge.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Patiently the consul explained this to Mun Ki, who was awed by the presence of an official and who wanted to avoid trouble. “My wife and I don’t need the doctor,” he said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Explain that there will be no charge,” Whipple began, but he was interrupted by the consul, who, after listening to Mun Ki, explained: “If this man were in China, and if his other wife were pregnant, he would deliver her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What other wife?” Whipple asked in bewilderment. “The wife here is only his number two wife. The real wife stays at home with the ancestors in China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you mean to say . . .” Whipple spluttered, but again the consul interrupted to explain: “Mun Ki says that his Uncle Chun Fat has three wives in China, two in California and one in Nevada.” “Does he also have children?” Whipple asked. There was some discussion of this, and Mun Ki reported: “Seven in China, four in California, two in Nevada.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And did this uncle deliver all of his thirteen sons?” Whipple snorted. “I’m sure they must have all been sons.” “Of course,” the consul replied blandly. “Of course he delivered them, or of course they were sons?” This confused the consul, and he suggested: “Maybe we had better start again,” but Dr. Whipple had had enough. Pointing at Mun Ki he snapped: “Do it your uncle’s way. He seems to have had more experience than me.” And he left.</p>

  <p class="normal">Working by himself, Mun Ki produced a fine boy, but everyone in the white community was outraged to think that the barbarous Chinese would follow such a custom. “And to think,” one of the Hewlett girls cried, “all the time not fifty feet away there was one of the best doctors in Hawaii! Really, the Chinese are scarcely human.” And it was generally agreed that for a stubborn man to insist upon delivering his own wife when practical, proved assistance from a real doctor was available, was proof that the Chinese were not civilized.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Whipples got another shock when they asked what the chubby, healthy little boy was to be called. “We haven’t been told yet,” Mun Ki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How’s that?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki said something about not yet having taken the poem to the store to find out what the child’s name would be. Dr. Whipple started to ask, “What poem?” but he felt he’d better not, and said no more about the name, but some days later Mun Ki asked Mrs. Whipple if he and his wife could be absent for a few hours, and when Amanda asked why, he explained: “We must take the poem to the store to find out what the baby’s name is.” Mrs. Whipple called her husband and said, “You were right, John. The Kees are taking a poem to the store so as to get a name for their baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d like to see this,” Dr. Whipple said, for such things were of concern to him, and Mun Ki said he would be honored to have such a distinguished man assisting at the naming of his first son, but before they started to the store Whipple asked, “Could I see the poem?” And from the precious genealogical book Mun Ki produced a card containing the poem from which all names in the great Kee family were derived. It was an expensive, marbled, parchment-like cardboard bearing in bold poetic script fourteen Chinese characters arranged vertically in two columns. “What is it?” Whipple asked, his scientific curiosity aroused, but Mun Ki could not explain.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Chinese store to which the trio headed stood at the corner of Nuuanu and Merchant streets and was known simply as the Punti store, for here that language was spoken and certain delicacies favored by the Punti were kept in stock. The storekeeper, an important man in Honolulu, recognized Dr. Whipple as a fellow tradesman and ceremoniously offered him a chair. “What’s this poem my cook is talking about?” Whipple asked, whereupon the Punti said, “Not speak me. Him. Him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And he pointed to a scholar who maintained a rude office in the corner of the store, where he wrote letters in Chinese and English for his Punti clients. Gravely the letter-writer picked up the poem and said, “This belongs to the Kee family. From it they get their names.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s it say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s not important. This one happens to read: ‘Spring pervades the continents; earth’s blessings arrive at your door. The heavens increase another year; and man acquires more age.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s it got to do with ‘names?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The answer is very complicated, and very Chinese,” the scholar replied. “But we are very proud of our system. It is probably the sanest in the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can you explain it?” Whipple asked, leaning forward in his chair.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In China we have only a few family names. In my area less than a hundred. All one syllable. All easy to remember. Lum, Chung, Yip, Wong. But we have no given names like Tom or Bob.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No names?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“None at all. What we do is take the family name, Kee, and add to it two ordinary words. They can be anything, but taken together they must mean something. Suppose my father were a Kee and believed that I would be the beginning of a long line of scholars. He might name me Kee Chun Fei, Kee Spring Glorious. That’s the kind of name we seek for your cook s boy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where does the poem come in?” Whipple pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“From the poem we receive the mandatory second name. All men in the first generation had to be named Chun, Spring, from the first word in the poem. All their offspring in the second generation had to be named Mun, Pervades. And all in the third generation, like the boy we are considering today, must be named from the third word in the poem, Chow, Continent. There is no escaping this rule and the benefit is this. If your cook Kee Mun Ki meets a stranger named Kee Mun Tong, they know instantly that they are of the same generation and are probably cousins.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sounds sensible,” Whipple admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So the naming of this man’s son has got to start Kee Chow, because that’s what the poem says.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then why doesn’t he just add any third name he likes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah!” pounced the letter-writer. “There’s the problem! Only a scholar can be trusted to pick that third name, for on it depends the child’s entire good fortune. I’ll ask Mun Ki who gave him his third name.” There was a furious exchange of Chinese, after which the letter-writer reported triumphantly: “His parents summoned a learned priest from Canton. The man spent three days pondering his name. He consulted oracles and horoscopes, and finally the right name was selected. You see, a man’s name can influence his entire life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So the Chinese in Hawaii consult with you because you are a scholar?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Alas, there are some who are so ignorant they do not even know their family poems, and such people don’t care what they name their sons. But Mun Ki comes from a strong family. They saw to it that he carried his family poem with him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The scholar now ignored Whipple and began a long conversation with Mun Ki, and after fifteen or twenty minutes he returned to Whipple and explained: “I have been inquiring of Mun Ki what his hopes are for his son, for this is important in choosing a name.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The discussion continued for some time, and gradually the scholar began getting some paper in place and a Chinese brush, and after about an hour of speculation on the name, he reported to Whipple: “We are beginning to narrow it down. We are trying to find a word which will harmonize with Kee and Chow but at the same time add dignity and meaning. It must be a word that sounds well, looks well when written, has its own peculiar meaning, and combines well with the second word in the name. It must also express the father’s hopes for his son, so you will excuse me if I concentrate on this and propose several possibilities.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With his brush he began drafting a variety of Chinese characters, and some he rejected as too feminine for a strong son like Mun Ki’s, and others because they had alternative readings that might offend. Sometimes Mun Ki refused a name, and gradually the scholar began to confine the possibilities to a few choices. At last, in triumph, he announced the boy’s name: “Kee Chow Chuk, the Kee who Controls the Center of the Continent.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He asked, “Isn’t that a splendid name?” and Dr. Whipple nodded, whereupon the scholar took Mun Ki’s genealogical book and on the appropriate page wrote down the bright new name, filled with parental hope. The scholar studied the handsome characters with obvious pleasure and told Whipple, “There’s a name that looks good from any angle. It’s what we call auspicious.” He then took a sheet of writing paper and asked Mun Ki, “What’s your village?” and when the cook replied, the letter-writer made a few swift strokes addressing the letter to that village, advising the elders that Kee Mun Ki was dutifully reporting the fact that he had a son whose name was Kee Chow Chuk, and in the ancestral clan book that name should be recorded. The family was going on. In remote Hawaii there was now a Kee who paid respect to his ancestors, who would in due time start sending money home, and who finally would return to the village, for to live elsewhere was unthinkable.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, as Kee Mun Ki and Nyuk Tsin were leaving the Punti store, the scholar made a dramatic gesture which changed the entire history of the Kees in Hawaii. As if a vision had possessed him, the name-giver cried, “Halt!” And with slow, stately gestures he tore up the letter to the Low Village, scattering its shreds upon the floor. Trancelike he approached Mun Ki, took away the genealogical book and splashed black ink across the propitious name he had just composed. Then, in a low voice, he explained: “Sometimes it comes like a flash of lightning on a hot night. After you have pondered a name for many hours you catch a vision of what this child can be, and all the old names you have been considering vanish, for a new name has been written across your mind in flame.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you such a name for Mun Ki’s boy?” Whipple asked respectfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have!” the scholar replied, and with bold strokes of his brush he put down the fiery name: Kee Ah Chow. He repeated it aloud, awed by its splendor.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought it had to be Kee Chow Ah,” Dr. Whipple suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It does!” the scholar agreed. “But sometimes rules must be broken, and this child’s name is surely Kee Ah Chow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The scholar handed the new name to Mun Ki and explained in Punti: “As you were leaving the store I had a sudden vision of your life. Your family’s bold and you will venture far. You will have many sons and great courage. The world is yours, Mun Ki, and your firstborn must have a name that signifies that fact. So we shall call him Kee Ah Chow, the Kee who Controls the Continent of Asia. And your next sons shall be Europe and Africa and America and Australia. For you are the father of continents.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki smiled deprecatingly, for the words were sweet. He had always imagined himself as rather special, a man nominated by the gods, and it was good to hear a scholar confirming the fact. Giving Nyuk Tsin an imperative shove, he started to leave the store, but again the scholar stopped them, pointing imperatively at Nyuk Tsin and crying, “And her name shall be Wu Chow’s Mother, for she is to be the mother of continents.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This prophetic announcement caused embarrassment, and Mun Ki had to explain in Punti: “She is not my wife. My real wife is a Kung girl in China. This one is merely . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">The scholar folded his hands, studied Nyuk Tsin, and replied in Punti, “Well, that’s the way of China. Maybe it’s better, seeing that she’s a Hakka.” He shrugged his shoulders and turned to go, then paused and added, “Let her be known as Wu Chow’s Auntie.” Mun Ki nodded and told his wife her new name.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple was perplexed by this exchange of words he could not understand, but he judged the matter under discussion was one of importance, and from the manner in which Nyuk Tsin stood, the blood of shame rising to her ears, he guessed that they were talking about her, but no one explained what was being said. Finally Mun Ki bowed. Wu Chow’s Auntie bowed. Together they recovered the poem and the name book, and when Mun Ki handed them to Nyuk Tsin to carry he touched her hand and said proudly, “We are going to have many sons.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The scholar, for his important role in naming the Kee’s first-born, received a fee of sixty cents, and Mun Ki considered the money well spent, for he was certain that his child was properly launched; but Dr. Whipple, who was then much concerned with the manner in which his own children and grandchildren were occupying themselves in Hawaii, was even more deeply impressed by the incident. He recognized it as symbolizing one of the strengths of the Chinese: “They exist within a hierarchy of generations. Their names tell where they belong, and remind them of their parents’ hopes for them. A Chinese lives within a defined system, and it’s a good one. No matter where he goes, his name is listed in a village, and that’s home. We Americans drift where we will. We have no name, no home, no secure address. I’d like to know more about the Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So although he was then sixty-seven years old and preoccupied with important matters, John Whipple began his last scientific work: a study of the Chinese whom he had brought to Hawaii, and much of what we know today about those early Orientals—those strange, secret people imported to work the sugar—we know from what he wrote. It was Whipple who cast a shadow of fear across the other sugar planters by publishing an article in the Honolulu Mail: “We are deluding ourselves if we persist in the belief that these intelligent, thrifty and hard-working people will long be content to stay upon the plantations. Their natural destiny is to work as accountants and mechanics in our cities. They will be excellent schoolteachers and I suppose some will become bankers and enterprisers of great force.</p>

  <p class="normal">As soon as their indentures are discharged, they are flocking to our cities to open stores. More and more, the commerce of our countryside will fall into their industrious hands. Therefore, it behooves us to look about and find other workmen to take care of our cane fields for us; for the Chinese are not going to persist in a condition of servitude. They will learn to read and write, and when they have done this, they will demand a share in the government of these islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There may be some who decry this development, but I for one applaud it. Hawaii will be a stronger community when we use our Chinese to their fullest advantage, and just as I would never have been content to be merely a field hand, doing the same chore over and over again, so I am gratified when I see another man who, like me, is determined to better himself. At one point, when I was engaged in the business of bringing Chinese to these islands, I believed that when their indentures were discharged they would return to China. Now I am convinced that they will not do so. They have become part of Hawaii and we should encourage them to follow in our footsteps. Let them become educated. Let them initiate new industries. Let them become fellow citizens. For through them the dying Hawaiian race will be regenerated.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Honolulu’s reaction was simple and dramatic: “The sonofabitch ought to be horsewhipped!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Rafer Hoxworth stormed: “We brought those damned Chinamen here under the specific understanding that after five or ten years in the sugar fields they’d go home. Good God! Whipple wants them to stay! It’s by God downright indecent.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders’ son, and now Dr. Whipple’s partner in J &amp; W, said, “The old man must be out of his mind! Why, one of our biggest problems in running the plantations is that as soon as the Chinese get a chance they leave us and open a store in Honolulu. I .can take you to Nuuanu Street and show you half a dozen shops started by men who ought to be working for me right now, growing cane.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But what infuriated Hawaii most was the sly manner in which the Chinese, who had no women of their own, had been stealing Hawaiian women, and marrying them, and having babies by them. In spite of the fact that the babies were some of the most handsome ever bred in the islands, extraordinarily intelligent and healthy, the white community was outraged and passed laws to stop these criminal marriages. One edict forbade any Chinese from marrying a Hawaiian girl unless he became a member of the Christian church. The speed with which Chinese men learned the catechism was staggering, and one Chinese passed along to another the correct answers to the critical questions, so that it was not uncommon for a Chinese to utter, as his first words in broken English, the complete Nicene Creed plus explanations of the Trinity, the Virgin birth and Calvin’s doctrine of predestination. One minister, after examining several such impromptu scholars, told a fellow Calvinist, “With my own ears I heard these men answer every important question correctly, and at the end I was tempted to ask one more, ‘What does it all mean?’ but I have never dared to ask even my Boston friends that fearful question, and I eschewed doing so here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, the Chinese made good Christians and did so without reservation. They were determined to have women, and conversion seemed a cheap price to pay. Those lucky ones who married Hawaiian girls with land and who grew to great wealth from manipulating that land, founded substantial Christian families and supported the large churches that were built by other Chinese; but when a male grandson was born, these prudent men went quietly to the Punti store and worked out a proper Chinese name for the boy, and sent that name back to the village hall, where it was written in the clan book.</p>

  <p class="normal">As for the Hawaiian women, they preferred Chinese husbands to any other, for there were no men in the islands who loved women and children more than the pigtailed Chinese, and it was not uncommon to see a thin, bedraggled Chinese man, who had slaved all day on the docks for H &amp; H, come home to where a hugely fat Hawaiian wife watched in idleness as he did the laundry, washed the children and cooked the evening meal. A Chinese husband brought presents and spent time educating his sons. He saw that his daughters had ribbons, and on Sunday he would take his whole brood to church. It became recognized in the islands that the very best thing that could happen to a Hawaiian girl was to catch herself a Chinese husband, for then all she had to do was laugh, wear fine brocades and rear babies.</p>

  <p class="normal">But there was a subtler reason why the Hawaiians tolerated Chinese marriages: they saw with their own eyes that Chinese-Hawaiian children were superb human specimens. When the first such girls began to mature Honolulu was breathless at their beauty. They had long black hair with just a suggestion of a wave running through it, olive skin, a touch of mystery about their eyes and handsome teeth. They were taller than their Chinese fathers, much slimmer than their copious mothers and they combined the practicality of the Chinese with the gay abandon of the Hawaiian. They were a special breed, the glory of the islands; and practically every writer from America or England who took part in launching the lively fable of the beautiful Hawaiian girl, had in his mind’s eye one of these first Chinese-Hawaiian masterpieces; and they justified all that was written about romantic Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">The boys were promising in another way. They were quick to learn, good at games, very good at business and best of all at politics. They had a shameless charm in soliciting votes for their candidates, were gifted in repartee, and had a basic honesty which the public grew to respect. So the Hawaiians, who had been a vanishing race-- 400,000 in 1778, 44,000 in 1878--suddenly received a vital impetus from the Orient and began to re-establish themselves through the Chinese-Hawaiian mixture, until in later years the part-Hawaiian was to become the fastest-growing component in the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Rafer Hoxworth, watching the beginning of this miracle, spoke for all his Caucasian friends except Dr. Whipple when he said, “Any Chinese who leaves a plantation to become a peddler should be immediately deported, but any who touches a Hawaiian girl should be hung.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the Honolulu Mail the Hewletts reported more moderate reactions: “Hawaii is ruined. The Chinese are fleeing the plantations, and who will raise our sugar?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple, having gained only contumely from his last public writing on the Chinese, confined his subsequent thoughts to his diary: “It was on the island of Oahu in 1824 that I first saw measles sweep through a Hawaiian village, leaving eighty per cent of the people dead, and it was soon after that I began considering what we could do to infuse new life into this lovable race which I had grown to cherish so dearly. I foresaw that only the introduction of some vital new blood could prevent the annihilation of these fine people. Erroneously, I thought that stronger Polynesians from the south might accomplish the reversal, but we imported such Polynesians and nothing happened. Later, I trusted that Javanese might suffice, and perhaps they would have, but we were unable to acquire them. And now the Chinese have arrived and they have served exactly as I long ago predicted they would. For my part in effecting this salvation of a race, I am humbly proud. At present the temper of the time is against me in this matter, so I keep my own counsel, but I am confident that the judgment of the future will support me. The best thing I ever did for Hawaii was to import Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As he wrote in his lamp-lit study, Mun Ki and his wife, in their small house nearby, were starting another son, the Continent of Europe.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>NYUK TSIN</span> and her husband had been in Hawaii about a year when the entire Chinese community was aroused by news filtering into Honolulu from the island of Maui, where many Chinese workers were engaged on plantations. As the Chinese got the news, this is what happened: toward dusk one hot day an elderly clergyman with a limp and carrying a cane forced his way into one of the temporary Chinese temples erected there for the use of the laborers, and disrupted worship. One woman who had been in the temple at the time reported: “The little man struck everything with his cane, knocked down the statue of Kwan Yin, tore up the golden papers and shouted words at us. When we refused to leave the temple, for it was ours and built with our effort and none of theirs, his great anger turned toward us, and he tried to strike us with his cane, shouting at us all the time. But since he was an old man, it was easy for us to avoid him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Chinese generally felt that this was but one more evidence of the hard life they were to have on the plantations, and much indignation resulted from the old man’s unexpected attack. Asked the Chinese, Punti and Hakka alike: “Don’t the white men respect gods?” And the divergence between the Chinese and the Caucasian increased.</p>

  <p class="normal">To the white men, the incident at the Buddhist temple was deplorable, and planters both on Maui and on other islands quickly got together small sums of money which they handed to the offended Chinese, so that some of the damage growing out of the attack was rectified. Dr. Whipple, as spokesman for the planters, went personally to Maui to mollify the laborers, and after a period of tension, reasonably good relations were restored, and all whites who employed Chinese took special pains to assure the strangers that they were free to worship as they pleased. Thus, in the mid-1860’s a true religious freedom was established in the islands: Congregationalists, Catholics, Episcopalians, Mormons, Buddhists and Confucianists worshiped side by side in relative harmony.</p>

  <p class="normal">When peace among the Chinese had been restored, the white planters took up the problem of wizened Abner Hale, and younger offspring of the old families, men like the Hewletts, the Whipples and the Hoxworths, convened in Honolulu to see what to do about the old man. Reported one of the Hewletts, honestly: “That pitiful fanatic, bursting in that way with his cane and his shouts of ‘Abomination! Corruption!’ almost ruined everything we’ve accomplished with the Chinese. We’ve got to make the old fool behave.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Years ago he did the same thing&#160; with the Hawaiians, as I understand,” Bromley Hoxworth explained. “One famous night when my mother was getting married to her brother, he burst into the ceremony and lashed about with his cane, destroying idols and raising merry hell. He still thinks he’s fighting the old Hawaiian gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Somebody’s got to advise him that things have changed,” one of the Whipple boys insisted. “Knocking down Hawaiian idols when it does no harm is one thing, but destroying Buddhas when we’re trying to keep our Chinese help happy is quite another.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The group turned to David Hale and suggested: “Can you talk to him, Dave?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d rather not,” the alert young man evaded. “I’ve never been able to make much sense with Father.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What we really ought to do is to get him off Maui altogether,” Brom Hoxworth proposed. “Truly, he oughtn’t to be there alone. He messes up the Seamen’s Chapel and interferes with the Chinese. He’s really a dreadful nuisance, and I agree with the others, Dave, that you’ve got to talk with him. Convince him that he ought to live in a little house here in Honolulu . . . where we could watch him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve tried that. So has Micah. The old man simply won’t listen to any proposal which requires his leaving Maui. If you raise the question, he says stubbornly, ‘My church is here, and my graves are here.’ And that’s that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whose graves?” Brom Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My mother’s grave, and your grandmother’s,” the intense younger Hale explained. “He plays gardener for them, and insists now and then upon preaching in the old stone church that he built. But I’m sure the minister would be delighted to see him get out of Maui.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the Whipple boys spoke: “Looking at the whole thing frankly, the fact that he’s left alone on Maui reflects on all of us, really. It looks as if we had cut the old man off … didn’t want him, because he’s sort of wandering in his mind. Now, I know that’s not the truth. I happen to know definitely that my father invited Reverend Hale to live with him, and your mother, Brom, did the same, and of course we all know that both Micah and David asked him to live with them. So our skirts are clean, as it were, but even so we get a good deal of opprobrium for allowing him to stay in that filthy little house of his.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And now if he’s going to start meddling with the Chinese,” young Hoxworth pointed out, “he’s really got to be cleaned out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The group therefore proposed that Dr. Whipple be dispatched once more to Lahaina to reason with Abner, and with some reluctance the trim, white-haired leader of Janders &amp; Whipple climbed aboard the Kilauea and ploughed his way through the rough channel to Maui. He had barely started down the pier when he saw his rickety old friend pecking his way among the crowd and accosting one of the sailors from the ferry.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you happen to hear any news of a little girl named Iliki?” he asked querulously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, sir,” the patient sailor replied, for he was asked this question at each arrival of the Kilauea.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sadly the old man shook his head, turned and started for his home, but Dr. Whipple called, “Abner!” and the lame missionary stopped, turned about in the sunlight and studied his visitor. At first he could not quite understand who the thin, erect man in the black suit was, and then his mind cleared momentarily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“John,” he said softly, still refusing to accord the apostate his former title of Brother.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve come over to talk with you,” Whipple explained patiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ve come over to reprimand me for smashing the heathen temple,” Abner replied contentiously. “Don’t waste your words. If the bloody sacrificial rocks of the Hawaiians were evil and worthy to be destroyed, the gaudy red and gold temples of Buddha merit the same treatment.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s walk along to our offices,” Whipple suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We used to talk here, John, and this is still good enough for me.” He sat down on a coconut log, under the kou trees, where he could see the roads. “Not many whalers come here any more,” he mused. “But do you see that skeleton of a ship on the reef over there? The Thetis. How long ago we shipped on that rare vessel, John! You and Amanda, I and Jerusha. Later, you know, it was Malama’s ship. Now it rusts on the rocks, like you and me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what I wanted to see you about, Abner,” Dr. Whipple said quietly. “All of your friends, and I in particular, want you to leave Lahaina and come over to Honolulu to live with us. You are rusting on the reef, Brother Abner, and we want to take you home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I could never leave Lahaina,” the old man said stubbornly. “Jerusha is here, and so is Malama, and I couldn’t leave them. My church is here and all of the people I have brought to God. I see the Thetis every day . . .” and with mention of the old ship that had brought him to his triumphs and his troubles his mind grew dim, and he added pathetically, as if he were aware that he was losing the thread of his argument, “And I expect Iliki to come back soon, and I should not like to be absent on that day.” He looked up in childish victory at his old friend, as if this line of reasoning were irrefutable.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple, who had seen a good deal of the death of minds and men, showed no irritation with his old friend’s obstinacy. “Abner,” he reasoned patiently, “the younger men who run the plantations are most determined that you not be allowed to disrupt their good relationships with the Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Those pigtailed heathens worship idols, John. I tell you I have seen it with my own eyes!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Chinese are rather difficult to handle at best, Brother Abner,” John quietly agreed, “but when you smash their temples, wholly extraneous problems are introduced.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“John, you and I labored for many years to erase the evils of heathenism from these islands, and in our old age we certainly can’t sit idly by and see our victory snatched from us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother Abner,” the doctor rationalized, “the Chinese problem is different from what we faced with the Hawaiians.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner’s mind cleared and he stared coldly at his old friend. “Different?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple noticed that Hale’s eyes had lost their film, and he thought to make the most of these moments of lucidity, so he spoke rapidly: “The Chinese religion is an old and distinguished form of worship. Buddha and Confucius both existed long before the birth of Christ, and the systems of ethics which they evolved have dignity. They must not be confused with the raw, pagan rituals that we found here on Hawaii when we arrived. Furthermore, the Hawaiians were steeped in ignorance and required leadership to the light, but the Chinese had a flowering civilization while Massachusetts was still a wilderness, so they do not need the same kind of spiritual instruction that we had to give the Hawaiians. But what disturbs the younger men most, including your sons Micah and David, who commissioned me to come here to talk with you, is that the Hawaiians were never really a part of our society. They lived on the outskirts, as it were, but the Chinese we need. Our whole economy depends upon harmonious relations with them, and anything which runs the risk of driving them from the plantations cannot be tolerated.” He had ended his comments with a threat which he had not intended when he started, but there it was.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner missed the threat, for halfway through his friend’s monologue he had clearly caught its central theme, and now he drew back appalled at the ravages which years and success can effect in a man who had originally launched his career in honor and dignity. The lame little missionary studied his visitor with contempt, and pity, and said finally, with the sorrow of Jeremiah and Ezekiel in his voice, “Dear John, I am ashamed to see the day when wealth and concern for a sugar plantation could force you to come to Maui and tell me, ‘It was all right to destroy the gods of the Hawaiians, because they didn’t work in <span>OUR</span> fields, but we need the Chinese to make money for us, so their heathen gods we must honor.” I am ashamed to witness such corruption in the soul of a good man, John, and I now think you had better get back on the boat and go home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple was stunned by the turn the conversation had taken, and he again resorted to threats: “Your sons say that if you don’t . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">With some dignity old Abner Hale rose to his unsteady feet and dismissed his visitor: “I was not afraid of the whaling captains, nor of their rioting sailors, and I am not afraid of my own sons. There is good in the world, John, and there is evil. There is God in the universe, and there are heathen idols, and I have never been confused as to whose side in the great Armageddon I fight upon. An idol is an idol, and if a Christian is tempted to make money from an idol, then that idol above all others ought to be destroyed, for as Ezekiel commanded: ‘Thus saith the Lord God, Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.’ I wish to talk with you no further upon these matters, John, but when you have left I will pray that before you die you will recover once more the sweet, clean soul you brought to these islands . . . but lost somewhere among the sugar fields.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The little missionary turned his back on his old friend and limped off to his small and dirty shack. When Dr. Whipple tried to overtake him and reason with him, saying, “Abner, you must come to Honolulu with me,” the missionary brushed him away and would not speak, and when Whipple followed him right to the door of the filthy hovel in which he was spending his last days, Abner slammed that door against him and Whipple could hear him kneeling against a chair and praying for the corrupted soul of his one-time roommate on the Thetis.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple returned to Honolulu and issued instructions to his managers on Maui that they must assume responsibility for keeping Abner Hale away from the Buddhist temples, for it was imperative that the Chinese be protected from any additional disturbances. The Hale boys sent regular funds to Lahaina, in care of the plantation managers, so that their father could be insured good food and medical care. Twice a year they begged the weak old man to come to Honolulu and live with them, and twice a year he refused.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in 1868 that Nyuk Tsin and the Chinese community throughout Hawaii finally realized how strange and barbarous the white man’s society really was, for word came into Honolulu that the ancient father of the Hales had died alone, ignored and untended on the island of Maui. The news was difficult to believe, and Nyuk Tsin gathered her Hakka friends at the Hakka store, while Mun Ki sat on his haunches in the Punti store trying to get the appalling news into focus. In both stores this was the news:</p>

  <p class="normal">“You say the father of all these famous and rich people was allowed to die in poverty?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I was there, and I saw them find his old worn-out body in the cemetery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What was he doing there, this old man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He had gone to care for his wife’s grave, and then he was doing the same for the grave of some Hawaiian lady. It looked as if he had died late in the afternoon, falling over the Hawaiian grave, and he was there all night.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You say he lived in a pitiful little house?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So small and dirty you wouldn’t believe it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And here his children have such big houses. Have you seen the houses of his children?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. Are they good and fine?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Li Lum Fong works for his son Micah, and he says Micah’s house is one of the best in Honolulu. The old man’s first daughter is married to Hewlett, and they have much wealth. His second daughter is wed to one of the Whipples, and they have a big house, and his second son also married a Whipple, so he is very rich.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have his children grandchildren among whom the old man could have lived?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The families have two grandchildren, and five, and five, and six.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And he died alone?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He died alone, caring for the graves, but no one cared for him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When this was said, this harsh summary of the white man’s fundamental unconcern for human values and respect for one’s ancestors, the Chinese in the various stores sat glum, bewildered. Some of them, reminded of their longing to see some ancestral hall in a remote Chinese village, would rock back and forth on their haunches, trying vainly to comprehend a family with four big houses and eighteen grandchildren who had allowed an old man to die alone and untended. How could the families be indifferent to the bad luck attendant upon such an untended death? In such discussions the Chinese often wanted to speak, to say, “How I long to see my father in the High Village!” but no words came, and they returned to their gloomy discussion of Abner Hale’s death.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wasn’t he the old man who knocked down the Chinese temples?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I saw him once running in with a club. He limped, but when he was knocking down temples he was extremely vigorous, and the plantation managers had to put a guard on him, every day, and if the little old man started for a temple the guard would shout, ‘Here he comes again!’ and white men would run out and capture him and take him home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You would think, under those circumstances, that it would be the Chinese who wanted to see him dead, and yet it is we who are mourning him, and his own family cares nothing about his death.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But in the big houses there was profound, silent grief. A Mormon missionary told Micah Hale: “On the last day your father met the ferry and inquired after the girl Iliki. He then picked some flowers and I met him on the road leading to the church graveyard. He shook his stick at me and cried, ‘You are an abomination. You should be driven from the islands.’ If I had had my thoughts about me, I should have followed him then, for he seemed weak and faltering, but so often we do not do that which we should, and I passed him by, keeping away from his stick. He certainly went on to the church and tried to get the pastor to allow him to preach again on Sunday, but as you know, he wandered so much that preaching was hopeless, and the minister put him off. That was the last anyone saw of him. He was found fallen across the grave of an alii nui of Maui, a woman, I believe, that he himself had brought into the church.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That night I had a clear premonition that I had done an un-Christian thing in passing your father by, and once I started to see if he had gotten home correctly, but I failed to do so, but on my morning walk I stopped by his house to wish him well, and he was gone. I hurried out to the cemetery, expecting to find him fallen along the way, but as I explained, he had died at the grave.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Hale, I’ll not mince words. There were, as you are well aware, harsh comments made concerning your father’s death alone in Lahaina, but I know and all like me know how hard you tried to make his last days easier. He was an obstinate man and would permit no kindness. I suffered from his sharp tongue, so I know. I want to reassure you that the true facts are known, and only the fools of the city condemn you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As I have said, there was profound grief in the four Hale houses, for the children could remember how their father had cared for them, and loved them, and taught them, and changed their sheets when they had fevers and sacrificed his life for them, that they might be worthy children. They could see him, a father of terrible wrath, keeping them tightly confined to the small, walled-in garden; and they remembered his dreadful lamentations when Reverend Eliphalet Thorn took them away from his care. From that day on, each of the four Hale children had tried vainly to return to his father the love he had spent on them, but he would not accept it. He rejected his oldest son Micah for having married a part-Hawaiian. He scorned David for refusing to become a minister. He despised Lucy for having married young Hewlett, who although he was pure white was nevertheless half-brother to half-castes. And he ignored Esther, his baby, for having married a Whipple who had publicly made fun of missionaries. The sorrow of his four children was deep.</p>

  <p class="normal">But they were also New Englanders, and when the Honolulu community whisperingly condemned them for having abandoned their poor old dim-witted father, allowing him to die in a filthy shack in distant Lahaina, the Hales felt it imperative that they appear in public. They accepted the scorn and walked proudly as if there were no whispers following them. When aggravating hostesses tempted them with invitations, to see how they were bearing up, they accepted, and they moved normally in Honolulu society, grimly bearing the charges made against them. It was their duty.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the Chinese servants, seeing this, were more perplexed than ever, and in the stores they added to the whispers: “Li Lum Fong told me that last night Micah Hale and Mrs. Hewlett and Mrs. Whipple all went to a party. Now please tell me, please explain how a family that allows their poor old father to die in poverty, untended, can be so shameless as to appear in public, drinking alcohol and laughing? Even before the first year of mourning has ended.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will never understand these heartless people,” the Chinese agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN MUN KI’S SON</span> Asia started growing into a bow-legged, chubby-faced little toddler, he was promptly joined by the Continent of Europe and later Africa, who rioted around the kitchen floor as their parents prepared meals for the Whipples; and with the coming of these children a curious transformation occurred in the relationship between Mun Ki and his wife. Many centuries earlier Confucius had pointed out that the harmonious existence of husband and wife was most difficult to sustain: “Between the two let there be respect.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was common, therefore, in Chinese families for a husband never to hand his wife anything, for to do so seemed to imply: “I wish to give you this. You must take it.” Instead, he placed the object near his wife and she picked it up at her own time. Some ignored this particular convention, but there was another that all observed. As the scholar at the Punti store had explained to Dr. Whipple, a respectful husband never spoke his wife’s name, neither in public nor at home. As soon as a girl married she became simply Mun Ki’s wife; that was her profession and her personality. But when children arrived, special care was taken to hide her name from them, and there was scarcely a Chinese growing up in Hawaii who knew his mother’s name. It was never spoken.</p>

  <p class="normal">In Mun Ki’s case the problem was further complicated by the fact that this Hakka girl was not properly a wife at all, but merely a concubine, and she must never be called Mother; to do so would be offensive. It is true that she had borne the three sons, but their real mother was the official Kung wife who had remained dutifully behind in the Low Village. By Chinese custom this first wife would be the legal mother of any children Mun Ki might have, anywhere in the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">So the scrawny Hakka girl became Wu Chow’s Auntie—the Auntie of the Five Continents—and by this name she was known throughout the city. She considered herself fortunate, because in many families concubines like her were known contemptuously as “That One” or more simply “She,” but Mun Ki was not willing to give her those names, for he was impressed by the Punti scholar’s prediction that his Hakka wife was going to bear many sons and that they would share the continents. So whenever the tricky little gambler addressed his wife as Wu Chow’s Auntie, he felt a. special love for her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Not one of her children or many grandchildren would ever know her name, nor would they think of her as Mother, for as Mun Ki sternly reminded the boys: “Your mother lives in China.” And the boys became convinced that in the Low Village their mother waited for them, and it was to her they owed their devotion. In time a photographer traveled out from Canton, and in some villages he was stoned as a sorcerer attempting to steal men’s spirits with his magic, but in the Low Village, Uncle Chun Fat, who had been in California, said to his nephew’s pretty wife, “Get your picture taken and send it to the Fragrant Tree Country.” She did, and the Kee boys grew up with this brown-tinted picture of a regal-looking, well-dressed Punti woman staring down at them from the wall; and this photograph evoked in them a sterner sense of filial responsibility than Nyuk Tsin ever did.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was not concerned with these matters, for as a Hakka she was governed by two supreme drives: above all else she wanted an education for her sons, and to attain it she would sacrifice anything; after that she wanted to own some land. To attain either of these goals she required money, and she had been in Honolulu only a few weeks before she started hawking vegetables. Now, without telling the Whipples, she took in the laundry of unmarried Hakka men, but one day Dr. Whipple asked his wife, “Amanda, what’s all that blue clothing doing on the back lawn?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t have any blue clothing,” she replied, and they investigated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No more laundry!” Dr. Whipple ordered, but by that time she had already earned her beginning store of coins.</p>

  <p class="normal">She then switched to serving meals on the side to bachelor Chinese, and this proved fairly profitable until Amanda Whipple grew suspicious of the many strange men who were trailing up Nuuanu and slipping through the back garden gate. “John, forgive my evil mind,” she said one night, “but do you ‘think our maid is … well … all these men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“After all, she is only the cook’s second wife, and I suppose that if he thinks he can earn a little more money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“John! How horrible!”</p>

  <p class="normal">They agreed that something must be done and Dr. Whipple appointed himself detective. Some days later he staggered into the sitting room choking with laughter. “Ah, these evil Chinese!” he chuckled. “Amanda, Captain Hoxworth should see what’s going on in our back yard. It’d prove every suspicion he ever had.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“John! What is it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mrs. Kee, horrible thought, is serving hot meals. To unmarried men.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Whipple broke into an embarrassed laugh and ended by asking, “Why do our servants try so many ways to make extra money? We pay them good wages.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are determined to educate their children,” Dr. Whipple explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good for them, but not by running a restaurant on our property.” Again Nyuk Tsin was ordered to desist, but again she wound up with more coins than when she started.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her big venture came when she discovered that two acres of swampland on the Whipple property could be converted into money. This time she went to Dr. Whipple and in the barbarous pidgin that all Honolulu spoke, conveyed to him the following: “Could I use this swampland?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What for?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To grow taro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you Pakes eat taro?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. We will make poi.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You don’t eat poi, do you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. We will sell it to the natives.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple made some inquiries and found that Nyuk Tsin had a good idea. The Hawaiians were now working for wages in livery stables and mechanics’ shops and no longer wanted to waste their time making poi, so that the profession had fallen into the hands of Pakes. The bizarre idea appealed to Whipple and he told Amanda, “I’ve owned that swampland for years but it took a Pake to show me what to do with it. The more I see these people, the better I like them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As the days passed he became increasingly impressed by what Nyuk Tsin could accomplish with land. Whenever she found a few minutes’ respite from her long hours as maid, she would hurry down to her taro patch, tie her conical hat under her chin, roll up her blue trousers and plunge barefooted into the soft mud. She built dikes better than most men and constructed ingenious waterways that drained the land so it could be tilled and later flooded for taro. Dr. Whipple, watching her beaver-like industry, thought: “She has a positive affinity for the land.” He was not surprised, therefore, when she came up to him one hot day, wiping her muddy hands on a bunch of grass, to ask, “Will you sell me the swamp?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where would you get the money?” he teased.</p>

  <p class="normal">She astounded him by disclosing how much she had already saved. “The rest I will get from selling poi, and year after year I will pay you the money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This pleased Whipple, for it was the kind of frugal bargaining his own New England ancestors had probably engaged in when they wanted to send their sons to college; but he had to disappoint her. “This land’s too close to our house to sell. But there’s some up the valley I might let you have.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can we go see it?” Nyuk Tsin asked. “Now?” Her lust for land was such that she would have walked miles to see a field. For nearly fifty generations her Hakka people had yearned for rich valley lands, and here she stood among the choicest, determined to own some. That day it wasn’t convenient for Dr. Whipple to take her up the valley to see the useless swampland he had in mind and later he forgot, but Nyuk Tsin never did.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her progress to ownership was deterred by two setbacks. First her husband vetoed the idea of buying land, explaining: “We won’t be here long. It would be foolish to buy land that we would have to abandon when we sailed back to China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want a field,” Nyuk Tsin argued in her stubborn Hakka way.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Mun Ki reasoned, “our plan must be to save every dime we can get and take our wealth back to the Low Village. When we reach there, I’ll send you on up to the High Village, because you wouldn’t feel at ease among the Punti and my wife wouldn’t want you around.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What will happen to the boys?” Nyuk Tsin asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, since they’re really Punti, with Punti names, they’ll stay with their mother.” Seeing her shock he added hastily, “Of course, I’ll give you a little of the money we’ve saved and you can buy yourself a piece of land in the Hakka village, and probably we’ll see each other from time to time along the road.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would rather have land here,” Nyuk Tsin pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Auntie!” Mun Ki snapped. We’re not staying here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Her second setback involved poi, for clever as the Chinese were, they could not master the trick of making this island staple. Nyuk Tsin raised the taro beautifully, and Dr. Whipple said he had rarely seen better. She harvested it correctly, removing first the dark green leaves to sell as a spinach-like vegetable. Then she peeled the stalks for cooking like asparagus, the flowers having already been sold to be eaten like cauliflower. This left the big, dark corms for the making of poi. In the raw state they contained bitter crystals of oxide that made them inedible, but when boiled and peeled they were delicious, except that they looked like Roquefort cheese. It was these boiled corms that Nyuk Tsin hauled to her poi board, a six-foot-long trough in which she hammered the taro with a lava-rock pounder, smashing and gradually liquefying the mass until finally a glob of sticky, glutinous paste resulted. This was poi, the world’s most remarkable starch: it was alkaline rather than acid; it was more easily digestible than potatoes, more nourishing than rice; an infant of two weeks could eat poi with safety, while an old man whose stomach was riddled with ulcers could enjoy it with relish. Dr. Whipple, who amused his associates by having poi at his meals instead of bread or potatoes, termed it: “The only perfect food.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hawaiians loved poi and were relieved when the Pakes took over the grueling work of manufacturing it, but they could not learn to like poi the way Nyuk Tsin and her husband made it. On days when poi was ready to be sold, it was an island custom to hang along the street a small white flag, and when Nyuk Tsin first displayed hers she had many pleased customers, but later they complained that her product lacked quality. Her poi was not the bland, neutral food they craved, and with apologies they inquired if she had been careful to keep her utensils clean, for whereas in ordinary living the Hawaiians were fanatics about cleanliness, in the making of poi they were maniacs. If a fly lighted on a poi bowl, they would throw the contents out, and the damning word was passed along that Pake poi wasn’t clean. Worse, it had lumps.</p>

  <p class="normal">A further complication developed. The dollar that formed the basic currency of the islands was broken down into three conflicting coin systems: ten American dimes equaled a dollar; so did eight Spanish reals; so did four English shillings. The latter could be chopped in half with a cold chisel to make eight sixpences to the dollar. Since dimes and reals were of about the same size, the Hawaiians tried to convince the Chinese that a dime worth ten cents was just as good as a real worth twelve and a half, whereas for her part Nyuk Tsin tried to collect reals and pay back dimes, so there was constant warfare.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Kees made up their fifth batch of poi, the white flag flapped outside for a long time before any customers appeared, but finally a big Hawaiian woman ambled in, dipped her finger into the purplish paste and tried it upon her tongue. With obvious disgust she grumbled, “I’ll take three bundles, for half price, in dimes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was too much for Nyuk Tsin. Weighing hardly one third as much as her huge customer, she leaped forward and started shoving the woman back into the roadway, while the big Hawaiian started slapping at her as if she were an irritating fly. A considerable row ensued, which brought Dr. Whipple into the yard with an edict: “No more poi to be sold.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This embittered Mun Ki, who foresaw the loss of much money, and he condemned his wife for being so stupid as not to know how to make poi; but a worse humiliation was to follow. The Kees now had several gallons of the ugly-looking paste and frugal Nyuk Tsin ordered everyone to eat it instead of rice. As her husband bravely gulped the unpalatable starch he made wry faces and then discovered with dismay that his sons preferred it to rice.</p>

  <p class="normal">Banging down his bowl he cried, “This settles it! We’re going back to China as soon as our contract ends.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s sign for five more years,” Nyuk Tsin pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Mun Ki stormed. “I will not tolerate the day when my own sons prefer poi to rice. They’re no longer Chinese.” And he made a motion to throw out the poi, but Nyuk Tsin would not permit this. “All right, Wu Chow’s Auntie,” he grumbled. “I’ll eat the poi, but when it’s finished, I’m going back to China.” Uncle Chun Fat had undoubtedly made a million dollars in California, but it was obvious that his nephew wasn’t going to emulate him in Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, one good did come from the poi fiasco. Nyuk Tsin, always an experimenter, discovered that if she cut the stalks of her, taro plants into short segments and packed them in heavy brine, with stones loaded on top of the barrel to keep the brew compressed, in time the stalks became pickled. With steamed fish or pork they were delicious, and as a result of her invention she acquired unexpected funds from her taro patch. She sold the flowers as vegetables, the leaves for spinach, and the uncooked roots to the king’s poi factory on Fort Street. But the stems she kept for herself, and when they were properly pickled she loaded them into her two baskets and slung her bamboo pole across her shoulder. Barefooted, she went through the town hawking her Chinese sauerkraut. Dr. Whipple, observing her buoyant recovery from defeat, said to her one day, “Mrs. Kee, do you remember that field that I spoke about?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin’s eyes grew bright and Whipple marked how eagerly she awaited his next words, so he said slowly, “I’ve looked it over, and it isn’t worth much, so I’m not going to sell it to you.” Nyuk Tsin’s face became a study in yellow despair, and Whipple was ashamed of his trick, so he added quickly, “I’m going to give it to you, Mrs. Kee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was only twenty-two at the time, but she felt like a very old woman who had lived a long life, hoping for certain things that were only now coming to pass. Her almond-shaped eyes filled with tears and she kept her hands pressed closely to her sides. To herself she thought: “The land could have been mine, rich land in the Fragrant Tree Country,” and at this thought a pair of tears rolled down her cheeks. Aloud, she said as a dutiful wife, “Wu Chow’s Father tells me I must not bother with land in this country. Soon we shall be returning to China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Too bad,” Whipple replied, ready to dismiss the subject as one of no importance.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in the mind of the stubborn Hakka woman the land hunger that she had inherited from generations of her forebears welled up strongly. In a kind of dumb panic she stood on the Whipple lawn and watched Dr. Whipple walking away from her, taking with him her only chance of salvation—the promise of land—and in response to a force greater than herself she called, “Dr. Whipple!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The elderly scientist turned and recognized the agony through which his serving girl was going. Returning to her he asked gently, “Mrs. Kee, what is it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">For a moment she hesitated, and tears splashed down her sun-browned face. Unable to speak, she stared at him and her mouth moved noiselessly. Finally, in a ghostly voice, she whispered her decision: “When Wu Chow’s Father returns to China, I shall remain here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Dr. Whipple interrupted quickly. “A wife must stay with her husband. I wouldn’t think of giving you the land on any other terms.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The shocking probability that she was going to lose her land after all emboldened the little Chinese woman, and she confessed in a whisper: “He is not my husband, Dr. Whipple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He brought me here to sell me to the man you saw that day outside the fence. But he grew to like me a little, so he bought me for himself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple recalled the scene at the immigration shed and he sensed that what Nyuk Tsin was saying was true. But he was a minister at heart, and he now advised his maid: “Men often take women for strange reasons, Mrs. Kee, and later they grow to love them, and have happy families. It is your duty to go back to China with your husband.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But when I get there,” Nyuk Tsin pleaded, “I will not be allowed to stay with him in the Low Village. He would be ashamed of my big feet.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What would you do?” Whipple asked with growing interest.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would have to live up in the Hakka village.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple’s conscience had often been stung by the inequities he witnessed in life, but he was convinced that obedience to duty was man’s salvation. “Then go to the High Village, Mrs. Kee,” he said gently. “Take your sons with you and lead a good life. Your gods will support you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With cold logic she explained: “But my sons will be kept in the Low Village and I will be banished from them. They would not want it known that I was their mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple walked away from the Chinese maid, kicked at the grass for some minutes, and returned to ask her several questions: How did she meet Kee? Was it true that he had brought her to Hawaii to sell her? Was it true that if she returned to China she would be banished from both her husband and her sons? Where were her parents? When he heard of her kidnapping and of her bleak future he thought for some time, then said bluntly, “We’d better go look at the land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He opened the wicker gate and led the barefooted woman with the basket hat about a mile up the Nuuanu Valley until they came to a low-lying field, an ancient taro patch now fallen into disuse. Much of it consisted of a swamp running down to the banks of the Nuuanu Stream, but as Whipple and his Chinese servant looked at it that day they could visualize it as it might become: the far end would raise fine taro; the dryer land would be good for vegetables; in that corner a woman could have a little house; and in years to come, the city of Honolulu would reach out to encompass the area. It was an interesting piece of land, worth little as it stood; worth a fortune when energy and planning had been applied to it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is your land, Mrs. Kee.” The strange-looking couple shook hands and walked back to the Whipple mansion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin did not divulge this compact to her husband, nor did she tell him of her intentions to remain in Hawaii when he left, for Mun Ki was a good man. As long as he was with his concubine in a strange land he was both kind and considerate, but as a realist he knew she could share no part of his life when he returned to China, and it never occurred to him that this future fact would in any way influence his present relationship. He loved Nyuk Tsin and treasured her four sons. She was pregnant again and he was happy. He was doing well as a runner for the chi-fa game and had established himself as one of the principal mah-jongg gamblers in Honolulu. He particularly liked the Whipples, who were exacting but just employers, and once he observed to the doctor: “It looks as if my six-year cycle began with my arrival here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s the cycle?” Whipple asked, for although he was appalled at the callousness shown by Mun Ki in his proposed treatment of Nyuk Tsin when they returned to China, he liked the brash young man and found him interesting.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Chinese say, ‘Three years of bad luck, six years of good,’” Mun Ki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the cook had passed along to other work, Dr. Whipple stood reflecting on this chance phrase, and it explained much about the Chinese. He observed to Amanda: “We Christians focus on the Old Testament: Seven fat years have got to be followed by seven lean ones. The world balances out. Good luck and bad equate. It summarizes the Jewish-Christian sense of remorseless justice, one for one. But the Chinese envisage a happier world: ‘If you can stick out three bad years, six good ones are sure to follow.’ That’s a much better percentage, and it’s why the Chinese I meet are such indefatigable optimists. We Anglo-Saxons brood on the evil that has to follow good. The Pakes know that good always triumphs over evil, six to three.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One afternoon he entertained an insight that struck him like a vision: “In fifty years my descendants here in Hawaii will be working for the Chinese!” At the time when this thought came to him he was watching Nyuk Tsin rebuilding her waterways after a storm, patiently leading the runaway waters back home to her taro patch, and as he saw the muddy stream bringing richness to her soil, he pounded his fist into his palm and said, “I’ve been talking about it for nearly fifty years. Now I’m going to do it.” He drove down to the J &amp; W offices and summoned all the young Janderses and Whipples and showed them a map of Oahu Island. “Four fifths of it’s a desert,” he said crisply, reminding them of something they already knew. “It grows nothing but cactus and you can’t even raise decent cattle on it. The other fifth over here gets all the water it needs, but the land is so steep you can’t farm it, so the water runs out to sea. Boys, I’ve often talked about building a ditch to trap that water over there,” and he pointed to the rainy windward side, “and lead it over here.” And he banged his fist down on mile after mile of barren acreage. “This week I’m going to start.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of his own sons was first to speak, saying, “If God had wanted the water to fall on these dry lands, He would have ordered it, and any action contrary to God’s wish seems to me a reflection on His infinite wisdom.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple looked at his son and replied, “I can only cite you the parable of the talents. God never wants potential gifts to lie idle.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the Janders boys, a profound conservative, argued: “J &amp; W is overextended. There’s no money for chancy adventures.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A good firm is always overextended,” Whipple replied, but seeing that the younger men would surely vote against his using J &amp; W funds, he quickly added, “I don’t want you to put up any of your own money, but I’m surely going to gamble all of mine. All I want from you is lease rights to your worthless land on the dry side.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he had control of six thousand acres of barren soil, he hired two hundred men and many teams of mules and with his own money launched the venture that was to transform his part of Oahu from a desert into a lush, succulent sugar plantation. With shovels and mule-drawn sledges, he dug out an irrigation ditch eleven miles long, maintaining a constant fall which swept the water down from high mountainsides and onto the arid cactus lands. When his ditch faced some deep valley that could not be avoided, he channeled his water into a narrow mouth and poured it into a large pipe which dropped down to the valley floor and climbed back up to the required elevation on the other side, where it emptied out into the continuation of the ditch. Water, seeking its former level, rushed down the pipe and surged back up the other side without requiring pumps.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the ditch was finished and its effect upon the Whipple fortunes evident, he convened the J &amp; W men and showed them the map of Oahu, with arable areas marked in green. “We’re bringing water about as far as we can in ditches. Yet look at this map. We’re using less than twenty per cent of our potential land. Ninety per cent of our rainfall still runs back into the ocean. Gentlemen, long after I’m dead somebody will think of a way to pierce these mountains and bring that water over to this side, where it’s needed. I beg of you,” the white-haired scientist pleaded, “when the project becomes feasible, and sooner or later it must, don’t hesitate. Pool your funds. Go into debt if necessary. Because the man who controls that water will control Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the more conservative Janderses, who chafed at working under Whipple, whispered, “They always get dotty in their old age.” And the firm became so preoccupied with making money from John Whipple’s ditches that they quite forgot his vision of a tunnel through the heart of the mountains.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHILE NYUK TSIN</span> and her husband were suffering reversals in the manufacture of poi, they observed that difficulties were also visiting their favorite guest. Captain Rafer Hoxworth, when he dined at the Whipples, showed in his face the strain that had overtaken him with the illness of his gracious wife, Noelani, the tall and stately Hawaiian lady whose charm was so much appreciated by the Chinese. In 1869 it became apparent to Nyuk Tsin, as she served the big dinners, that Mrs. Hoxworth needed medical care, and as the year progressed, the tall Hawaiian woman grew steadily less able to sit through a long dinner without showing signs of exhaustion, and Nyuk Tsin grieved for her.</p>

  <p class="normal">The haoles, as Caucasians were called in the islands, were not able to understand what had brought their beloved friend so close to death, but the kanakas, as the Hawaiians were known, understood. Of their declining sister they said, “Ho’olana i ka wai ke ola.—Her life floats upon the water.” But if Noelani herself was aware of this sentence, she betrayed her reactions to no one. She gave the appearance of a placid, pleased Hawaiian woman, graceful in motion and relaxed in countenance. She seemed like a secure brown rock facing the sea and richly clothed in sunlight; about her whispered the waves of her husband’s affection and that of her friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">Like a true alii, Noelani slept a good deal during the day in order to conserve her strength, but as evening approached she came alive, and when her two-horse carriage with its imported English coachman drove up to the big Hoxworth house on Beretania Street she displayed all the excitement of a child. Stepping grandly into the carriage she commanded the Englishman: “You may take me to the Whipples. But hurry.” When she arrived she was a figure of striking beauty. Already tall, she accentuated the fact by wearing high tortoise-shell combs in her silvery white, piled-up hair and a dress with a train of at least three feet which trailed as she entered. In the middle of this train was sewn a loop which could be passed over the fingers of her left hand, the kanaka loop it was called, and guests enjoyed watching how deftly Noelani could kick her train with her right foot, catching the kanaka loop with her left hand. Her dresses were made of stiff brocade edged with delicate Brussels lace. She wore jade beads that blended marvelously with her dark skin, jade rings and jade bracelets, all purchased in Peking. Near her heart she wore a thin gold watch from Geneva, pinned into place by a jeweled butterfly from Paris, while in her right hand she customarily carried a Cantonese fan made of feathers and pale ivory. Over all, she wore her Shanghai stole, four feet wide, embroidered in red roses that stood off from the fabric, and edged with a two-foot fringe of Peking knots. Captain Hoxworth, who loved buying her gifts, once said, “A smaller woman would be dwarfed by such an outfit, but Noelani’s always been a giant.” When she entered a room, her dark eyes flashing, she was a very noble lady, the symbol of a valiant race. And she was dying.</p>

  <p class="normal">She loved her clothes and parties and having her children about her, for if an evening passed when less than a dozen friends were in attendance, she felt lonely, as if in her last days her Hawaiian friends had deserted her. Then she would tell her husband, “Rafer, drive down to Auntie Mele’s and see if there’s anyone having a talk.” And if there was, the entire group would be brought up to the Hoxworths’ to visit with Noelani, who found breathing increasingly difficult.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her children had married well, and she found great delight in her fourteen grandchildren. Malama, her oldest daughter; had of course married brilliant Micah Hale. Bromley and Jerusha had each married one of the Whipple children, while Iliki had married a Janders, so that when the Hoxworths were assembled, most of the great island families were represented, and there was much talk of Lahaina in the good old days. In these autumnal hours Noelani enjoyed most her discussions with Micah Hale, who now played such an important role in Hawaii, for he was not only head of H &amp; H, he was also a nobleman with a seat in the upper house of the legislature, a member of the Privy Council, and the administrator of the Department of Interior. Often Noelani reminded him: “I was recalling our first conversation, Micah, on that Sunday in San Francisco, when you and I were both so certain that America would absorb our islands. Well, it hasn’t happened yet, nor will it in my lifetime. Kamahameha V will not sell one foot of land to the United States.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will unite,” her bearded son-in-law assured her. “I am more positive than ever, Noelani, that our destiny will be achieved shortly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ve been telling me that for twenty years and look what’s happened. Your country has been torn apart by civil war, and mine has drifted happily along, just as it always was.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do not believe it, Noelani,” Micah reproved, stroking his copious beard as if he were addressing a legislature. “Each wave that reaches the shores of these islands brings new evidence that we will shortly be one land. I expect it to happen within ten years.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why are you so sure?” Noelani pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For one simple reason. America will need our sugar. In order to safeguard the supply, she will have to rake over the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you working for that purpose, Micah?” the elderly woman asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Indeed, as are all men of good sense.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does the king know this?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He appreciates the problem better than I do. He prays that Hawaii will remain independent, but if it cannot, he prefers that the United States absorb the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m glad I shall not live to see it,” Noelani said wearily as the Chinese servants began bringing in the food.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Hoxworths dined with the Whipples the thing that impressed Nyuk Tsin was the extraordinary gentleness with which Captain Rafer cared for his wife. Throughout the Chinese community he was the favorite haole, for although he had abused the coolies on their voyage to Hawaii, and cursed them for leaving the plantations, in other respects he had proved a just friend. The man whose face he had kicked in got a good job, and the one whose ankle was broken when he was pitched into the hold was given money to import a wife into the islands. Whenever an H &amp; H ship arrived with cargo of special food for the Chinese, Captain Hoxworth was there to supervise the unloading, for he loved the smell of faraway places, and he was a familiar visitor to both the Punti and the Hakka stores. He slapped women on the backside and joked with men. If he happened to be carrying a bottle of whiskey, which he often was, he would knock off the cork, take a swig, wipe the bottle with his wrist, pass it to the Chinese, and then take another swig when it returned to him. He had a free and easy way that the Chinese appreciated and a capacity for suddenly imposing his will upon them which they respected. In private he railed against the Chinese peril; in public he treated them decently.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was his obvious love for his Hawaiian wife which impressed them most, and the tall, rugged old captain with his white sideburns never looked more appealing than when he was gently helping Noelani into her carriage for a visit to some friend’s for dinner. At such times he hurried before her to the carriage carrying her cashmere blanket, which he fixed on the rear seat. Then he waited and held out his strong right arm for her to lean on as she climbed painfully into the conveyance. Next he tucked the blanket about her feet and then adjusted her stole over her shoulders. Then he walked sedately in front of the horses—never around the rear of the carriage—and patted them on the flanks and on the noses. Then he came back to the rear door of the carriage and climbed in beside his tall Hawaiian wife. Giving his English driver a signal, he would sit back with her and nod to the evening strollers while his horses pranced through the dusty streets. Apart from the king, Captain Hoxworth was the most dignified and memorable man in Hawaii, and he knew it.</p>

  <p class="normal">November nights can be cold in Hawaii, for then the days are short and the sun is low in the heavens, and as November, 1869, progressed, it became obvious to all that Noelani must soon be confined permanently to bed in her last lingering illness, for Dr. Whipple said, “I can’t find what’s wrong, but obviously she ought to stop going out so much.” To this, Captain Hoxworth replied, “Noelani’s not an ordinary woman. She is the Alii Nui of these islands and she will continue to ride with me as long as her strength permits, for she thinks it proper to move about among her people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The nights grew colder and Captain Hoxworth wrapped his wife in more shawls. Once, when she seemed extremely weak and bordering on collapse, he asked her, “Would you prefer, my dear, to stay at home this night?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” she said. “Why should I?”</p>

  <p class="normal">So he helped her into the carriage and they drove not directly down Beretania but by way of King Street and Nuuanu and he pointed out various sights to her, as if she were a tourist seeing Honolulu for the first time. “That’s where we’re building the new H &amp; H receiving warehouses,” he explained, “and I propose buying land here for our office building. Over there’s where the Chinese are opening a store for vegetables and meat.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He kept his sensitive finger on the pulse of Honolulu as it throbbed toward new life, but at the same time he kept close to his wife as she spent her last energies. At dinner that night, at the Hewletts’, he altered the seating arrangements so that he could stay near her, and when she faltered he said calmly, “This may be the last time Lady Noelani will dine with friends.” But she had rallied, and as December came she told her husband that she enjoyed more than anything else her evening drives with him, so on the eighth night in December he had the carriage roll up to take her to the Whipples’ for dinner, but when Nyuk Tsin saw her enter the dining room, like a tall, shrunken brown ghost, she gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dinner that evening Captain Hoxworth shocked everyone but Noelani by saying a terrible thing: “When Noelani’s mother, the great Alii Nui of Maui lay dying, her husband used to creep in to see her on his hands and knees, bringing her maile from the hills. I think it a shame and lacking in dignity to see a sweet Hawaiian lady with no maile chains about her, so I have asked some of my men to fetch us maile from the hills, and I should like to bring it to my Alii Nui.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He went to the door and whistled loudly for his coachman, and the Englishman ran up with maile chains and Captain Hoxworth placed the fragrant vines about his wife’s shoulders. Then he took a chair far from her and said slowly, “The first time I saw Noelani must have been in 1820, when she was a girl. And I saw her on a surfboard, standing up with not a stitch of clothes on, riding toward the shore like a goddess. And do you know when I saw her next? In 1833. I walked out to her home, knocked on the door, and the first words I ever said to her were, ‘Noelani, I’ve come to find me a wife.’ And do you know what her first words to me were? ‘Captain Hoxworth, I will go with you to the ship.’ So we went aboard the Carthaginian, and she never left.” He smiled at his wife and said, “Looking at the way people get engaged and married today, I’d say they had very little romance in their bones.” He winked at her and then looked at the guests.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To you young men who aren’t married, I’ve only one bit of advice. Hang around the shore till you see a beautiful Hawaiian girl surfing in, completely naked. Marry that one, and you’ll never regret it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He took the sick woman home that night, and she never appeared on the streets of Honolulu again. Her death was a strange passing, a mysterious disappearance. No doctor could explain why she was dying, but it was obvious that she intended to do so. Like the poetic race of which she was the noblest part, she drifted casually away, and in late December she announced: “I will die in early January.” The sad news spread through the Hawaiian community, so that all during the festivities of that season big women appeared at the Hoxworth door, barefooted and with flowers, explaining: “We have come to grieve with our sister.” For hours they would sit about her bed, saying nothing, and at dusk, like ponderous, doomed creatures, they would slip away, leaving their flowers behind. Before Noelani died she summoned her son-in-law, dark-bearded Micah Hale of the Privy Council, and she directed him: “Look after Hawaii, Micah. Give the king good advice.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Each time, before I counsel with him, I pray that God will direct me in the right way,” he assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t want you merely to be pious,” she said. “I want you to be right.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is only through prayer that I can discern the right,” he countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you as determined as ever to take Hawaii into the Union?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will see it happen,” he insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Noelani began to weep and said, “It will be a sad day for the Hawaiians. On your day of triumph, Micah, be gentle and understanding with your wife. Malama will support you, of course, but on the day you exterminate the Hawaiian kingdom, she will also hate you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Austere Micah Hale wanted to be lenient at this moment, the last during which he would see his powerful mother-in-law, but like a prophet from the Old Testament he was forced to add, “In the affairs of nations there is a destiny, Noelani, and it cannot be avoided.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She replied, “In the affairs of races there is a destiny, too, and ours has not been a happy one.” He bowed and started to leave, but she called him to her bedside and said, “I should like to pray with you, Micah.” He kneeled and she intoned: “God, survey the actions of this headstrong young man with the beard. Inspire him with gentleness as well as rectitude.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At her funeral in the old Makiki burial grounds Captain Hoxworth caused excitement by refusing to leave her grave. He remained there for several hours, not weeping or carrying on, but standing beside the grave and looking down across Honolulu toward the ships and out to Diamond Head. At Waikiki the surf was rolling in, and he could see the little figures of men riding upon the waves, and the skies were blue with cloud racks piled upon the horizon, and below lay the sea, the restless, turbulent sea upon which his life had been led.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How wonderful it’s been,” he thought. “I wouldn’t change a day of it. Even now, somewhere out there, the sperm whales are breeding, and I’m part of them. Go to it, whales! Soon enough somebody like me’ll come along and stick a harpoon in you. Have fun while you can!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Hoxworth had never taken great pleasure in his children, allowing them to develop as they would, but now with Noelani gone he suddenly transformed himself into the benevolent old head of the family, and it became his habit to convene his son and his three daughters with their families and to sit benignly at the head of his table, dispensing charm and affection. He spoke of the old days in the South Pacific and of his adventures in China. It was his opinion that a man had to wait until he was dead to know the meaning of God, unless he happened to have known the sea in his youth.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To sail before the mast when you’re thirteen, to know the abuse of wind and foul captains, to find the spiritual solace that arises from the fo’c’s’l, arid then to drive yourself inch by inch to the captaincy and then the ownership of the vessel, these are the ultimate tests of a man. It’s in such contests with fate that a man comes to know exactly how he stands with God. And don’t you forget it, you young men who came to your positions the easy way,” and he looked sharply at his son Bromley and his sons-in-law: Janders, Whipple, Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had already spotted Micah as by far the ablest of the group, and at his family dinners, to which the younger men willingly came, he talked more and more to Micah. “Any enterprise of moment is like commanding a ship, Micah. There are plots against the captain, and he’s got to put them down ruthlessly. You may not like to kick a man in the face, I never did, but it may be the only way you can maintain control of your ship. And that’s what’s important. Control.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was his opinion that the next decade would produce a series of fundamental crises which would determine the future of Hawaii, and, more important, the future of the powerful firms that sought to control the business enterprise of Hawaii. “Disregard the dear, fat, old kings. They are of no consequence whatever and should be kept around to amuse the people. The important thing is Hoxworth &amp; Hale and Janders &amp; Whipple and Hewlett’s. Keep them on the right track, and the kings’ll have to follow suit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he talked thus he was disturbed to find that Micah Hale did not agree with him. “We must settle this problem of the foolish kings,” Hale insisted. “It is infuriating to see them wasting the substance of this kingdom, and I am more determined than ever to do something about it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Micah!” Captain Hoxworth reproved. “You be content with making H &amp; H the most powerful company in the Pacific, and the kings’ll take care of themselves. Remember what I say. Hell, son, you’ll be the real king, the one that matters.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is not the destiny of Americans that they should live under kings,” Micah repeated stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll tell you what the destiny of America is,” Hoxworth boomed, thrusting his handsome, white-haired head forward among his children. “If Hawaii prospers and makes money, America will suddenly discover that we’re part of its destiny. But if you allow the firms to fool around and squander our inheritance, America won’t give a damn for us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In these discussions with Micah the wiry old captain tended to ignore his ineffective son, Bromley, and when Micah argued against him on the matter of Hawaii’s civil government, falsely holding it to be of more importance than the profitable governance of H &amp; H and the other big companies, Hoxworth noticed that among his listeners one quick intelligence matched his own, and without ever directing himself purposely and obviously at this attentive listener, he began tailoring his comments so that Bromley’s thirteen-year-old boy, Whip, could understand, and he was gratified to see how soon this wiry, quick boy with the sharp eyes caught on.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have always held,” he said, speaking ostensibly to the boy’s uncle, Ed Janders, who had married Iliki--it was curious the way in which Captain Hoxworth named his own children after women he had loved: Jerusha, Bromley, Iliki; but his wife had understood-- “I’ve held that a man’s life should begin at thirteen. He should go to sea, or engage in great enterprises. His mind should already have grappled with the idea of God, and he should have read half the fine books he will read in his entire lifetime. Any single minute lost after you’re thirteen is an hour irretrievably gone.” It was interesting to the old captain that Iliki’s husband didn’t understand a word he was saying, but his grandson Whip Hoxworth understood it all.</p>

  <p class="normal">The captain therefore formed the habit of taking the high-spirited boy with him as he rode about Honolulu, and that year the community became accustomed to seeing handsome Captain Hoxworth parading the streets with his alert grandson, introducing him formally to his business associates and explaining shipping customs to the boy. One day the minister asked, “Captain, isn’t the boy attending school any more?” And Hoxworth replied, “What I’m teaching him he can’t get in school.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He took his grandson down to the wharves to see the H &amp; H ships come in from Java and China, and he made the boy stay down in the fo’c’s’l for entire days while he went about other work, saying, “If you’ve got a good imagination, and I think you have, you can construct what it must have been like to sail before the mast.” He also said, “There is one thrill of the sea that every man must discover for himself, the arrival at some strange port after a long voyage. Whip, remember this. Travel about the world. See the forbidden cities and dive into them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He said this while standing ‘tween decks in a converted whaler, and in the half-darkness he added, “Whip, the two greatest things in life are sailing into a strange port and thinking, ‘I can make this city mine,’ and sailing into the harbor of a strange woman and saying, ‘I can make this woman mine.’ Whip, when I’m dead I don’t want you to remember me as I was in church or as I looked sitting at the big table at night. I want you to remember me as I was.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He left his gig at the wharves and walked westward from the bustling docks until he and his grandson came to a section of evil-smelling little houses strung along a network of alleys. “This is Iwilei,” Captain Hoxworth explained. “Rat Alley, Iwilei, and down here I’m king.” But if his words were true, he was a king incognito, for no one in the alleys of Iwilei spoke to him. A few Chinese who had made money that week gambling, a few sailors, a few minor men from the smaller businesses of Honolulu ambled past, intent upon their business, and the first thing young Whip Hoxworth noticed was that in Iwilei even men who knew each other did not speak; as if by magic a man was invisible because he wished to be so.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is where I often come,” the old captain explained, and he led his grandson into a dark and inconspicuous shack, the inside of which was well lighted and tastefully decorated. A Chinese who imported his girls from Macao, ran the place; he nodded deferentially to Hoxworth, who said, “I want to see all the girls.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A truly motley crew lined up in bathrobes and slips: a Spaniard from Valparaiso with no high combs in her hair; an Italian girl from Naples who had shipped into Honolulu on a whaler; an Irish girl from Dublin who knew Captain Hoxworth and who gave him a kiss—young Whip liked her and she smiled at him; two Chinese girls and one Javanese, who seemed forbidding and aloof. “Who’s the youngest girl here?” Captain Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This China girl,” the curator of masterpieces replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can she speak English?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. She don’t have to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Today she have to,” Hoxworth replied. “You go out and find me the youngest girl you can, but she’s got to speak English. I want her to explain things to my boy here.” When the proprietor left to scurry about among the sinks of Iwilei, the Chinese and Javanese girls retired, but the others who could speak English gathered about the captain and his charge, admiring the young man.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How old is he?” the pleasant Irish girl asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thirteen,” Hoxworth replied, putting his virile arm about the questioner. “And at thirteen it’s high time a man gets to know what delicious things women are. How old were you, Noreen, when you discovered the fun in men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was thirteen,” the happy Irish girl replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you, Constanza?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was twelve, in back of the cathedral in Naples.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was fourteen myself,” Hoxworth apologized. “And it happened in your home city, Raquella, and that’s why I’ve always treasured Valparaiso. I had shipped on a whaler . . . well, you wouldn’t be interested, but I spied on the sailors to see where they were going with such determination, and I marched in after them and said, “Me, too!” And everybody roared with laughter as I plunked down my shillings, but thereafter they treated me with more respect. And, Whip, they’ll treat you with more respect, too. Not because they’ll know you were here. That’s got to be kept a secret. But because you’ll know something the others don’t know. And this knowledge is what makes some men men, while the lack of it keeps other men boys … all their lives. I’m afraid that your uncles and your father are boys. Goddamnit, I want you to be a man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The brothel keeper returned with a Chinese girl of uncertain age, but she seemed younger than the rest. She wore a black silk smock covering white pajama pants. She was barefooted and had her hair in a long braid, so that she looked completely alien to the boy who was intended to be her guest. He looked at her with frank curiosity, and when she saw this confused yet eager face, she smiled</p>

  <p class="normal">and took a step toward him. “I like to show him things,” she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Young Whip was momentarily afraid, and although he did not draw back, neither did he step valiantly forward, so his grandfather benignly put his left arm about the little Chinese girl and his right about his grandson. “Remember what I said about ships sailing into strange ports? Anybody can be brave enough to love a girl of his own color, but to be a man, Whip, you’ve got to stare right into the eyes of the brown girls and yellow and whatever you meet up with, and say, ‘You’re a woman and you’re mine.’ Because what a man’s got to discover is that there’s no gain in loving a particular woman. It’s the idea of woman that you’re after. Now you be real sweet with this pretty little Chinese girl. Because she can teach you the first steps in this grand discovery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Giving the curious pair his benediction, he pushed them gently toward the darkened hallway that led to the private rooms, and as they disappeared, hand in hand, he grabbed the Irish girl and cried, “Goddamn, Noreen, it’s exciting! Imagine! The first time!” The Chinese girl led Whip to a stall and showed him the furnishings. “Pretty, you think?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s real nice,” he stammered, holding tighter to her warm hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">She pushed him away from her, turned to face him and said, “It’s possible have much fun with a woman. You see?” And slowly she pulled her smock over her head, and when she had tossed the rustling silk onto a chair she smiled at Whip, placed her small brown hands under her breasts and moved her shoulders sideways in a slow rotary motion. “These made for men,” she explained, and without further instruction young Whip moved forward, pulled her hands away and replaced them with his own. Instinctively he lifted the small breasts to his lips, and as he was doing so the girl slipped off her trousers. It would have pleased Captain Hoxworth could he have witnessed how little instruction his grandson really required.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in other matters the boy needed substantial guidance. He was a wild-willed lad with only an average record at school, and his grandfather surprised him by insisting that he read long and difficult books like Pendennis and Jane Eyre, while the students at Punahou were struggling with Oliver Twist and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Captain Hoxworth also drilled his grandson on the necessity for showing a profit on anything one went into in the line of business, and his business principles were simple: “If you sell something, never give samples away. Make the bastards pay. And keep an eye on the help or they’ll steal the company right out from under you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was one lesson, however, which the ramrod-straight old captain impressed upon his tough-minded grandson above all others: “Living seventy years is a tremendous adventure. You’re thirteen now. You’ve probably only got fifty-seven Christmases left. Enjoy each as if you would never see another, for by God the day soon comes when you won’t. You’ve only got about two and a half thousand more Saturday nights remaining. Get yourself a girl and enjoy her. Never take a girl lightly. You may never sleep with another. Or she may be the one you’ll always remember as the best of the lot. But goddamnit, Whip, don’t be a weak old man before your time. Don’t be like your father and your uncles. God, Whip, you can’t even imagine what Hawaii’s going to be like in twenty years, or fifty. Maybe nobody’ll be growing sugar. Maybe they won’t need ships any more. Maybe this whole city and the hills behind will be part of China. But be courageous about guessing. Be on top of the wheel as it turns, not dragging along at the bottom.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment in his grandfather’s harangue young Whip made the old man extremely happy. The idea that Hawaii might one day be part of China did not entirely impress young Whip, but the mention of that country reminded him of Iwilei and he said, boldly, “I’d like to see that Chinese girl again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So would I!” the old man roared, and he hitched his horse and led his grandson down into Rat Alley, but when they got to the Macao man’s place, the Chinese girl could not be found, so Whip smiled as before at the Irish lass, who was heavier than he was, but his grandfather roared, “No, by God! Noreen’s‘ mine.” And he rustled up Raquella from Valparaiso, and the Spanish girl was so pleased with the idea of being with a bright-eyed young boy that when she had him alone she tore at him like a tigress, and he fought with her, tearing a red welt across her back until with a tempestuous sigh of joy she pulled him onto the floor and taught him things no boy in Honolulu and few men knew.</p>

  <p class="normal">And it was strange, but when he left Iwilei that day he was not thinking of women, but of strange ports, and the insatiable fighting of the world, and of ships—his ships—traveling to all parts of the globe to bring home strange people and stranger produce. “I don’t want to go back to Punahou,” he announced that evening at his grandfather’s big table.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you want to do?” asked his proper father, whose main job in life was hiding the fact that he was half-Hawaiian.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to go to sea,” young Whip replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That you shall!” his grandfather promised, but this was a promise that was most difficult to keep, and for a while it seemed as if the stuffy uncles, who did not know the wild, free girls of Iwilei, would triumph.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The boy has got to finish Punahou and go to Yale,” Bromley Hoxworth insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To hell with Yale,” Captain Hoxworth shouted. “Yale never did good for any man who wasn’t already formed by his own experiences. Your son is a different breed, Bromley. He’s for the sea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s got to get an education to prepare him for his later responsibilities with H &amp; H,” Bromley insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Listen to me, you blind, blind men!” Hoxworth stormed. “That is exactly my purpose in sending him to sea. So that he can obtain the education in the world that he will require if he is going to run your companies well. It is for your sakes that I want him to sail before the mast. Because there has got to be somebody in this timorous outfit who has developed courage and a free new way of looking at things.” He slumped back in his chair and said, “I’m growing tired of arguments.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The uncles supported Bromley, bearded Micah proving especially effective with his contention that a new day had arisen in Hawaii, one that required the exercise of prudence and conservative management. “It is our job to hold onto our position and consolidate our good fortune while we ponder what can be done about bringing these islands into the American orbit. Caution, hard work and intellectual capacity are what we require. Bromley’s right. The place to acquire those virtues is at Yale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Colossal horse manure!” Captain Hoxworth responded from his slumped position at the head of the table. “The abilities you’re referring to, Micah, can always be bought for fifteen hundred Mexican dollars a year, and do you know why they can be bought as cheaply as that? Because your goddamned Yale College can always be depended upon to turn out exactly that kind of man in bigger supply than the market can possibly absorb. But a man of daring, schooled at sea and in commerce and in knockdown fights . . .” He rose from the table and left in disgust. “Such men don’t come cheap. Nobody turns them out in large quantities.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The uncles kept young Whip sequestered from his grandfather, lest the stubborn old man ship the boy on one of the many H &amp; H cargo carriers about to sail from Honolulu. To balk what they suspected was the old captain’s plan, they prepared to ship Whipple back to New England, where in rather quieter quarters he could prepare himself for Yale; but one March morning in 1870 Captain Hoxworth ferreted out where his grandson was being kept, and he drove there hurriedly in his gig and told the boy: “Hurry, Whip, we’ve got only a few minutes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For what?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re shipping to Suez.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The stalwart young fellow, now almost fourteen and tall for his age, smiled at his erect old grandfather and said, “I have no clothes here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come as you are. You’ll appreciate clothes more if you have to work for them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They drove rapidly to the docks, where Whip automatically headed for a large H &amp; H ship which seemed ready to put out to sea, whereupon his grandfather caught his arm, wheeled him about in the sunlight, and asked scornfully, “Good God, Whip! Do you think I’d ship you on one of my own boats? There’s what you ride in, son!” ‘And he pointed to a three-masted weather-beaten old whaler from Salem, Massachusetts. The years had not been good to this ship, for she had entered the whaling trade after its peak had been reached, and without ever finding her logical place among the wandering ships of the world, she had stumbled from one occupation to another. Three times she had changed her rigging and now sailed as a barkentine, bound for a speculative run to Manila for an overload of mahogany which the Khedive of Egypt required for a palace he was building. She had already waited at the pier half an hour beyond her announced time of departure, but since she had consistently missed the master schedule by which the oceans of the world operate, this was no new experience. Nevertheless, her captain chafed and he was not in a good humor when Rafer Hoxworth hurried up with his grandson.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is the boy I told you of,” Hoxworth said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Looks strong,” the surly captain snarled. “Get below.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d like a minute with him,” Hoxworth said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You can have six,” the captain agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Quickly Rafer Hoxworth swung himself down into the fo’c’s’l, grabbed his grandson by the arms and said hurriedly, “Once you leave this harbor, Whipple, that evil-tempered man topside has the absolute power of life and death over you. His word is law, and he’s no puny Yale professor. He’s a tough, cruel man, and you’ll get no sympathy from either him or me if you play the coward.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now, Whip, if you get into a fight, and you will, remember one thing. Fight to kill. There’s no other rule. And when you’ve got a man fairly licked and on the deck, always kick him in the face so that when he gets up he can’t contend that he almost had you down. Bruise him, scar him, mutilate him so that he can never forget who’s boss. And when you’ve done this, help him up and be generous.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whip, you’ve tasted Chinese girls and Spaniards. There are a thousand more to sample. Try ‘em all. That’s the one thing you’ll do in life that you’ll never regret. Whip, I want you to come home a man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As the fleeting seconds passed, the youth wished vainly that he could prolong this moment endlessly, for he felt deeply attached to this wild old grandfather of his, but the last question he asked was so surprising both to himself and to his grandfather that Rafer Hoxworth fell back a few steps: “Grandfather, if you liked the girls at Iwilei so much, how did you feel about Noelani? I can’t get this straight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a moment of silence, and then Rafer said, “When Noelani’s mother died she weighed close to four hundred pounds. Your great-grandmother. And every day her husband crawled into her presence on his hands and knees, bringing her maile chains. That’s a good thing for a man to do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But how can you love a lot of girls and one woman, too? At the same time?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You ever study the skies at night, Whip? All the lovely little stars? You could reach up and pinch each one on the points. And then in the east the moon rises, enormous and perfect. And that’s something else, entirely different.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He shook his grandson’s hand and scrambled topside, waved to the surly captain, and leaped down onto the dock. The old whaler creaked and groaned as her ropes were loosened. A fresh wind came down off the mountains in back of Honolulu, and a voyage was commenced.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it was discovered what Hoxworth had done with his grandson, the entire community was outraged. Bromley Hoxworth and his brothers-in-law talked for a while of dispatching one of the H &amp; H ships to intercept the dirty old whaler and take the boy off, but Hoxworth pointed out: “He signed papers, and if you know the captain of that ship, the only way that boy will ever get off is either to die at sea and be buried feet-first under a scrap of canvas, or serve his time properly like a man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, Honolulu softened toward the resolute old captain and the citizenry began to speak of him with amused affection, recognizing him for what he was: the leading resident of the islands. If he entered a bank, he was treated with deference. In church he was bowed to by the pastors, and at the library, which he had always supported with generous gifts, he was accepted as the patron saint of learning. The Chinese of Honolulu referred to him as “that courtly, sweet old man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He died in June, 1877 full of years and public acclaim. At his deathbed were Hales and Whipples and Janderses and Hoxworths-- the leaders of Hawaii--but the surviving mortal on whom his thoughts rested was his grandson Whip, happily bedded down in a Manila brothel with an agile little Cochinese lately imported from Saigon.</p>

  <p class="normal">ON <span>THE AFTERNOON</span> of Captain Rafer Hoxworth’s funeral, Dr. John Whipple, then seventy-one years old but spare and well preserved, returned from the cemetery to his home, where he found the pregnant Nyuk Tsin waiting for him, and he supposed that finally she had surrendered her prejudices and had come to ask his medical advice upon her condition, but that was not the case. She said, “Mun Ki him sore leg, you help,” and she requested a medicine to stop the itching that had arisen from her husband’s work in the taro patch. Dr. Whipple was acquainted with this curious irritation that sometimes resulted from the immersion of one’s legs in a taro bog, so he handed Nyuk Tsin a small jar of unguent, but as he did so he had the clear thought: “I’m getting careless as I grow older. I really ought to see the man’s leg for myself.” Months later he was to chide himself for this oversight, but in the days immediately following he did not.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin applied the unguent to her husband’s itching leg, and as she had predicted, within a few days the irritation disappeared, and he proceeded with his work as cook. On the fourth day Dr. Whipple happened to remember about the salve he had prescribed, and asked casually, “Leg, how he come?” And Mun Ki assured him, “Good too much.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But some time later the cook again experienced strange sensations in his right leg and the beginnings of the same in his left, and once more it was apparent to him that American doctors understood very little about the human body, so this time he tonicked himself with Chinese herbs—at night so that none could watch except his wife, who brewed them—and this time the medicine was effective, and the irritation left for good. Mun Ki was pleased, and vowed that thereafter he would fool no more with Dr. Whipple.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in July he noticed a new sore on the big toe of his right foot, and this one did not respond to normal Chinese medication. When he pointed this out to his wife, Nyuk Tsin argued: “Try the white doctor’s unguent,” and although Mun Ki knew this to be folly, he allowed his wife to smear it upon the toe, and to Mun Ki’s confusion, the sore healed perfectly, and he was perplexed. “You watch!” he warned his wife. “This white man’s medicine cures nothing. Next week the sore will be there again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And to his personal gratification, he was right. The sore reappeared, and worse than before. He therefore drank more Chinese herbs and to a certain extent the sore improved, but now a dreadful itching occurred, and before long it passed over to his left foot as well. Then, to his dismay, a very small lesion opened on his left forefinger, and nothing either drove it away or subdued it, and he hid this fact from Dr. Whipple but he could not hide it from his wife.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin could never remember, in later years, just how the horrible, unspoken word first passed between herself and her husband, but she could remember the growing dread that filled their days—still with no words spoken and with life proceeding casually between them—until one morning, when she heard her husband scratching his legs, she went to him boldly, took him by the hands and said, “Wu Chow’s Father, I must go to see the Chinese doctor.” He dropped his eyes away from hers, sat staring at the floor and finally agreed: “You had better see him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">After the noonday meal was served, Nyuk Tsin slipped out through the garden gate and hurried downtown to the Chinese temple, where after much bowing she lighted incense before the compassionate picture of Lu Tsu, to whose wisdom she confided these facts: “Wu Chow’s Father has an itching that will not go away, and his finger is sore. We are afraid, Lu Tsu, and hope that you who know all medicines will aid us.” She prayed for a long time, then sought out the priest, a shaven-headed man with a kindly face and a bamboo holder containing nearly a hundred numbered slivers of wood. Carefully he moved the bamboo in an arc, repeating old prayers of proved efficiency, and gradually one of the sticks worked itself loose from the others, and it was number forty-one, a number which contained elements of hope. On a small piece of paper the priest wrote “Forty-one” and for a dime he gave it to Nyuk Tsin.</p>

  <p class="normal">She took her prescription across the river to a dirty little drug shop in Rat Alley, and when she handed it to the herb doctor he said, “Ah, forty-one is a very good medicine. You’re lucky today.” Behind him he had row after row of boxes containing precious herbs, and from box forty-one he measured out a spoonful and said, “You must brew a strong tea and drink it with a prayer. Is it for pregnancy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the honest woman replied, “it’s for Wu Chow’s Father.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The doctor’s expression did not change, but he thought quickly: “Aha! Another one who is afraid to come in person!” To Nyuk Tsin he said casually, “This is a fine medicine for itching legs.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m glad,” Nyuk Tsin said, not noticing that it was not she who had introduced the subject of itching legs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, as she was about to leave, the doctor said in an offhand manner, “I’m sure this will cure your man, but if it doesn’t, remember! I know all the medicines. Remember.” And as soon as Nyuk Tsin had gone, the doctor ran into another alley and cried, “Look Sing! Look Sing! Follow that one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Which one?” the loafer asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Hakka woman, with the big feet.” But Nyuk Tsin was hurrying home by a different route, and that day the spy did not overtake her. When he reported his failure to the herbalist the latter shrugged his shoulders and said, “She’ll be back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Medicine forty-one was completely ineffective and the growing agony in Nyuk Tsin’s mind could not be put to rest. “Wu Chow’s Father,” she implored, “you must come with me to the Chinese doctor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am afraid,” Mun Ki said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He told me he knew all the medicines,” Nyuk Tsin assured him, so when the dishes were washed and the four babies placed in the care of another Chinese woman, Nyuk Tsin led her husband slowly, and in breathless fear, down Nuuanu Street and across the river to Rat Alley. As they approached their meeting with the doctor, they formed an unusual pair, for Nyuk Tsin in her black smock and trousers did not hobble obediently behind her pigtailed husband, as Punti custom required; she marched side by side with him in the Hakka way, for she was his wife, and if what she suspected was true, in the days to come Mun Ki was going to need her as never before; and he sensed this need and was content to have his strong wife walking beside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they reached Rat Alley, and saw the row of shacks where the girls lived, Nyuk Tsin experienced an abiding gratitude toward the man who had kept her for himself instead of selling her to the brothel keepers, and in apprehension of what her life would have been like had Mun Ki not bought her, she drew closer to him, and when the alley narrowed she even took his hand, and at first he was constrained to throw it back, but he held on to it, and he could feel her fingers softly protecting the unmanageable sore on his index finger, and in that wordless moment a compact was built, and each understood it, for Nyuk Tsin was saying: “No matter what the doctor reports, I shall stay with you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the doctor saw them entering his shop he knew what their fears were, and he was certain that this meant money for him. He therefore held his soft, thin hands together professionally and smiled at the worried couple. “Did the medicine cure the itching?” he asked in Punti.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Nyuk Tsin replied. “And now Wu Chow’s Father has a sore on his toe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would like to see it,” the doctor replied, but when he had drawn a curtain aside so that sunlight could fall upon the floor where Mun Ki’s foot Stood, and when he kneeled down to inspect the unhealed lesion and the sickly white flesh around it, he instinctively recoiled in horror, even though he had known, when he knelt down, what he going to see, and Nyuk Tsin marked his action.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are there other sores?” the doctor inquired in a subdued voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">“On his other toes, and this finger, and his shins hurt,” Nyuk Tsin explained in broken Punti.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gravely the doctor examined each of these lesions. Then he rubbed his hands as if to cleanse himself of some terrible scourge. Nyuk Tsin watched this gesture, too, and asked bravely, “Is it the mai Pake, the Chinese sickness?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is,” the doctor whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, gods of heaven, no!” Mun Ki gasped. He shivered for a moment in the gloomy office and then looked like a thrashed boy pleading with his father. “What must I do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the doctor’s natural cupidity subdued any humane reactions, and he assumed his best professional manner—for he was not a doctor at all but a field hand who hated hard work—and assured Mun Ki: “There’s nothing to worry about, really. For the mai Pake I have an unfailing remedy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You do?” Mun Ki pleaded with animal ferocity. “You can cure these sores?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” The doctor smiled reassuringly. “I have several patients, and not one has had to surrender himself to the white doctors.” But Nyuk Tsin was studying the man carefully, and she knew that he was lying. She therefore said, openly, “Wu Chow’s Father, this man has no cure. Right now we should turn ourselves hi to the white doctors.” Her husband caught the phrase, “turn ourselves in,” and his wife’s implied promise that she would share the illness with him was more than he could at that moment bear, and he began to weep.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come,” Nyuk said bravely. “We will go now and talk with Dr. Whipple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the Iwilei doctor, fearing to lose a patient who seemed to have money and a good job, protested, in rapid Punti: “Are you, a respectable Punti gentleman, going to give up a chance of escape simply because a stupid Hakka wife thinks she knows more about the mai Pake than I do? Sir, have you thought of what it means if you report to the white doctors?” And he began conjuring up evil pictures: “The police coming to capture you? The little boat at the pier? The cage on deck? The journey to the island? Sir, your wife is pregnant now. Suppose it is a son. Why, you’ll never see your own son. Have you thought about that? And all the time I have a certain cure right here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course Mun Ki had thought of these extremities, and now to hear his fears paraded openly had an appalling effect upon him, and he collapsed against the doctor’s table, mumbling, “Is it really the mai Pake?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is the mai Pake,” the doctor repeated coldly. “The Chinese sickness. You have it; and in another month unless you cure yourself with my herbs, your face will begin to grow big, and your eyes will have a film upon them, and your hands and feet will begin to fall away. Look even now, you poor man!” And he grabbed Mun Ki’s index finger and pierced it with a dirty needle, and Mun Ki could feel no pain. “You have the mai Pake, my friend,” the quack doctor repeated, and as he saw his patient quivering with fear, he added, “The disease that the white doctors call leprosy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are sure?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Any white doctor will see that you have leprosy, and you know what they ,will do then? The cage on the little boat.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But can you cure me?” Mun Ki pleaded in terror.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have cured many patients of the mai Pake,” the herbalist replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Wu Chow’s Father,” Nyuk Tsin pleaded, knowing in her heart that this doctor was a fraud, but the herbalist realized that only a little additional pressure was required to make Mun Ki one of his most profitable patients, so he interrupted forcefully: “Be silent, stupid woman. Would you deprive your husband of his only chance of salvation?”</p>

  <p class="normal">This challenge was too reasonable for Nyuk Tsin to combat, so she retired to a comer and thought: “My poor, foolish husband. He will waste his money with this evil man, and in the end we shall have to run away to the hills anyway.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Mun Ki, in the silence, made his decision. “I will try your cures,” he said, and the quick-witted doctor replied, “It will take a little time, but trust in me and you will be cured. How much money did you bring with you?” Mun Ki, in panic, opened his purse and showed the doctor his meager store of dimes and shillings and reals, and the doctor said happily, “Well, this will more than pay for the first bundles of herbs, so you see it isn’t going to cost much, after all.” But when Nyuk Tsin started to draw back some of the reals, the doctor prudently slipped his hand over the coins and suggested: “I’ll give you more herbs so you won’t have to come all the way back to Iwilei so soon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The herbs will cure me?” Mun Ki pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Without fear,” the doctor reassured him, and with their cloth-wrapped bundle of herbs Mun Ki and his wife left the medical man and walked home.</p>

  <p class="normal">But now they were a different couple, for the unspoken fears that had haunted them when they journeyed to Iwilei had become realities: Mun Ki was a leper and the law said sternly that he must give himself up, and be exiled for the rest of his life to a dismal lepers’ island. He was different from all men, for he was irretrievably doomed to die of the most horrible disease known to man: His toes would fall away and his fingers. His body would grow foul, and from long distances it would be possible to smell him, as if he were an animal. His face would grow big and thick and scaly and hairy, like a lion’s; and his eyes would glass over like an owl’s in daylight; and then his nose would waste away, and his lips fall off, and the suppurating sores would creep across his cheeks and eat away his chin until at last, faceless, formless, without hands or feet, he would die in agony. He was a leper. Those were the thoughts of pigtailed Mun Ki on the hot July day in 1870 when he walked bedazed and in mental anguish back from Iwilei.</p>

  <p class="normal">His wife, walking boldly beside him and keeping his doomed fingers in her protecting hand, had a much simpler thought: “I will stay with him, and if he must hide in the hills, I will hide with him, and if he is caught and sent to the leper island, I will go with him.” In these simple thoughts she found solace, and never once in the months that followed did she deviate from them.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she led her stupefied husband back to the kitchen at Dr. Whipple’s she did exactly as the quack doctor had ordered: she brewed the ugly-smelling herbs and made her husband drink the broth. Where the doctor had pierced the finger with his dirty needle, she cleaned the wound, sucking it with her lips. Then she put Mun Ki to bed and cooked the evening meal, serving it by herself.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mun Ki not well,” she explained in the spacious dining room.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall I look at him?” Dr. Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” she said. “He be good quick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin had to keep her diseased husband—for the quack’s medication did no good whatever—away from public view, for that year there had been a general roundup of lepers, and some one hundred and sixty had been shipped off to the leper island to perpetual banishment and slow death; suspicious watchers had perfected tricks whereby to trap unsuspected lepers. One man boasted: “I can look at the eye of a leper and spot the disease every time. There’s a certain glassiness you just can’t miss.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Another argued: “What you say’s true, but that comes late in the disease. The trick is to spot it early, before others can be contaminated. The way to do this is to look for thickening of the facial skin. That’s the sure sign.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the first man countered. “There’s only one sure sign. When you shake a man’s hand, dig your fingernail into his flesh, and if he doesn’t wince, you’ve got a leper every time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin, watching her husband carefully, felt relieved that neither his eyes nor his facial skin yet betrayed the secret ravages of the disease, but she also noticed that he shivered more noticeably than before and that the sores on his feet were growing. “Somebody will see them, and they will tell the police,” she thought. To prevent this she went to the Chinese temple, and ignoring Lu Tsu, who had betrayed her, she knelt before the statue of Kwan Yin, the goddess of mercy, and prayed: “Help me, gentle Kwan Yin, to keep Wu Chow’s Father free. Help me to hide him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">These were evil years, indeed, in Hawaii. Before the coming of the white man, leprosy had been unknown. Then, in some unfathomable way, the alii contracted it, possibly from a passing sailor who had become infected in the Philippines, and from 1835 on, the great ravager had swept through the nobles of the island, so that the disease was secretly known as the mai alii, the sickness of the nobles, but coincident with the arrival of the Chinese, the virulent killer attacked the common people, who therefore gave it a permanent name: the mai Pake. In the areas from which the Hakka and Punti had come, leprosy was rarely known and it had never been a conspicuously Chinese disease, but the unfortunate name was assigned, and it stuck, so that in 1870 if a Chinese was caught with it, the measures taken against him were apt to be more stringent than those taken against others; so spies were more active among the Chinese, since rewards were greater.</p>

  <p class="normal">These were the years when an otherwise decent man would study his enemy’s face, and when he saw a pimple or impetigo or eczema he would denounce his enemy, and the man would be hunted down, arrested and thrown into the cage. There was no appeal, no hope, never an escape. The doomed man had only one chance to enjoy even the meanest decencies during the long years of his exile: if some unafflicted person, fully aware of her actions, volunteered to accompany him to the leper settlement, she was free to go in expectation of making his inevitable death a little easier. The saintly persons who stepped forward to share the hell of leprosy became known as the kokuas, the helpers. Mostly they were Hawaiian women who thus surrendered their own lives to aid others, and sometimes they themselves contracted the awful disease and died in exile; so that from those agonizing years the word kokua was to gain a special meaning, and to say of a woman in Hawaii, “She was a kokua,” was to accord her a special benediction unknown in the rest of the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, in the middle of September, when Nyuk Tsin was pregnant with her fifth child and when it became wholly apparent to her that Mun Ki would not be cured and that the quack’s herbs were of no use whatever, she waited one day until the evening meal ended and then she sent the children away and knelt before her husband, sharing with him the resolve she had made more than a month before: “Wu Chow’s Father, I shall be your kokua.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For some minutes he did not speak, nor did he look at the woman kneeling before him. Instead, he slowly picked up one of her needles and stuck it carefully into each finger of his left hand. When he had tested his fingers twice he said, “There is no feeling.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we hide in the hills?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No one has spied upon me yet,” he replied. “Maybe next week the herbs will work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Father,” she reasoned, “the doctor is a quack.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He put his hand upon her lips and said, “Let’s try once more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have almost no money left,” she pleaded. “We must save it for the children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please,” he whispered. “I feel sure that this time the herbs will work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So she took the last precious dimes and reals of her family and plodded down to Iwilei in the hot September sunlight, and when she entered Rat Alley, she noticed that two men watched her carefully, and first she thought: “They think I am one of the girls,” but quickly she realized that they were not looking at her in that way, and she gasped: “They’re spies, watching to see who visits the doctor. If they report Mun Ki they’ll get a little money.” So she hurried down a different alley and then up another and finally slipped into the doctor’s office.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was happy and hopeful. “Is your Punti husband getting well?” he asked graciously. And something in the man’s manner that day cautioned Nyuk Tsin and she lied: “He’s very grateful to you, Doctor. All the sores have gone and much of the itching in his legs. It’s been a wonderful relief to us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The doctor was surprised at this news and asked, “But nevertheless you wish a few more herbs?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Nyuk Tsin replied, sensing a great evil about her. “A little for the legs, and he’ll be cured.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’ll be cured?” the doctor repeated curiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Nyuk Tsin explained, feigning happy relief. “It seems not to have been mai Pake after all. More like a sore from the taro patch.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where does the cured man live?” the doctor asked casually, as he filled the jar, and the manner in which he spoke convinced Nyuk Tsin that he was in league with the spies outside, and that he was turning over to them the names of his clients, so that after the afflicted Chinese had used up all their funds on herbs, he could squeeze a few more reals from the government as a reward for turning them in to the leper authorities.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We live at Malama Sugar,” Nyuk Tsin said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nice plantation,” the doctor replied casually. “Which camp?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Number Two Camp,” Nyuk Tsin replied, but when the cautious, probing doctor handed her the herbs and started to pick up her family’s last coins, she could no longer tolerate him, and she swept the coins back into her own hand and grabbed a blue jar and knocked the top off and shoved the jagged glass into the doctor’s face, and when the glass cut him and his own quackery entered his eyes, causing them to pain, she threw the money in his face and whispered in a hushed, hate-choked voice: “Did you think you fooled me? I know you are reporting secretly to the police. You pig, you pig!” In uncontrollable fury she smashed half a dozen pots of herbs to the floor, kicked them about with her bare feet, and then grabbed the broken blue jar to assault the doctor again, but he fled whimpering to the rear of his office, so she hurried away down a side alley, but she paused long enough to peer back at the doctor’s shack, and when that man’s cries had continued for a moment, the two spies hurried up and went inside to rescue their conspirator, while Nyuk Tsin returned, by a devious path, to Dr. Whipple’s. When she reached home, she did not immediately go inside the gate, but walked on, stopping now and then to see if she were being followed. Then she went empty-handed to her husband and said, “The doctor was a spy. He was going to report us tonight, because his helpers were there, waiting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did you do?” Mun Ki asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hope I cut his eye out,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night she matured her second plan, for when the evening meal was over, she left the Whipple grounds and moved quietly about the Chinese community, going to families which had come to Hawaii with her in the hold of the Carthaginian, for all such men were brothers, and she said to each, “Will you take into your home one of the sons of your brother Mun Ki?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Almost invariably the Chinese would listen, say nothing, look at Nyuk Tsin, and finally ask, “Is it the mai Pake?” and without fear, for she knew that no Carthaginian man would betray his brother, she always replied honestly, “It is.” Then the man would ask, “And are you going to be his kokua?” And when Nyuk Tsin replied, “I am,” the man said either, “I will take one of your children,” or, “I can’t take a child myself, but let us see Ching Gar Foo, because I am sure he’ll take one.” But she noticed that they shuddered when they came near her.</p>

  <p class="normal">By midnight Nyuk Tsin had disposed of her four sons and her household goods and had made arrangements with a cook for one of the Hewlett families that when her unborn child arrived, Nyuk Tsin would return it to Honolulu by ship from the leper island to be cared for by that cook. She was therefore in a relieved if not hopeful mood when she returned to tell her husband that his sons would be cared for, but when she reached the Whipple grounds she saw an unaccustomed light in her quarters, and she started running toward where Mun Ki was supposed to be sleeping, but when she burst into the little wooden shack she saw Dr. Whipple standing beside the bed with a lamp in his right hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">The American doctor and the Chinese woman looked at each other in silent respect, and she saw that tears were running down the white-haired man’s face. He lifted Mun Ki’s hand and pointed to the lesions, and Nyuk Tsin, following the course that Dr. Whipple’s finger took across the doomed hand, had to look away. “It’s leprosy,” the doctor said. Then he held the lamp before his maid’s face and asked, “Did you know?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand,” he replied. Then, putting the lamp down he started to question her, but she asked, “Did bad men whisper you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Whipple replied. “It occurred to me that I hadn’t seen Mun Ki for some time and I recalled his itching legs. I was in bed, Mrs. Kee, and it suddenly came to me: ‘Mun Ki has leprosy,’ so I came out here, and I was right.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Morning come next day he go away?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Dr. Whipple said matter-of-factly, but the terror of his words overtook him and he said in a shaking voice, “Mrs. Kee, let us all pray.” And he kneeled in the little shack, and asked his maid to do the same, and he formed Mun Ki’s doomed hands into a Christian temple, and prayed: “Compassionate and merciful God, look down upon Thy humble servants and bring courage to the hearts of these needful people. Help Mun Ki to face the next days with a fortitude of which his gods would be proud. Help Mrs. Kee to understand and accept the things that must be done.” His voice broke and for some moments he could not speak; then, through tears that choked him he begged: “Compassionate God, forgive me for the terrible duty I&#160; must&#160; discharge.&#160; Forgive&#160; me,&#160; please,&#160; please forgive me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the prayer was said he slumped upon the floor and seemed not to have the strength to rise, but he did so and asked Nyuk Tsin, “Do you know what I must do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Doctor. Tomorrow police.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I must,” he replied sorrowfully. “But you can stay here as long as you wish, and all your children,” he assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I kokua,” she said simply.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had to look away from her face as the crushing force of this word struck him, for he knew what it meant: the banishment, the horrors of the leper settlement, the sons lost forever . . . He thought: “I would not have the courage.” Then he recalled that it had been Mun Ki’s plan to abandon Nyuk Tsin as soon as they got back to China, and to take her children from her, and now she was volunteering to go kokua with him. Slowly he raised his head and looked at Nyuk Tsin. She was a small Chinese woman with not much hair, slanted eyes, brown wrinkles about her mouth, but she was his sister, and he stepped forward and kissed her on each cheek, saying, “I should have known that you would go kokua.” He turned away to stanch his tears and then asked brightly, like a minister, “Now, what can we do about the children?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tonight I fix one boy here one boy here one boy here, all fix.” She told him which families would take whom, and when this was explained she asked, “Tomorrow police?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I must. In God’s mercy I must.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know, Doctor. Long time ago I speak my husband, ‘Police go,’ but we hope.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“God will forgive those who hope,” the old man said.</p>

  <p class="normal">As soon as he was gone, Mun Ki was out of bed, explosive with energy. “We will run to the hills!” he swore. “The police will never find us there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How will we eat?” Nyuk Tsin pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll take food,” Mun Ki explained excitedly. He had visions of a free life in the mountains. He and Nyuk Tsin would work for nobody and maybe even the sores would go away. “Hurry!” he cried. “We must be gone before the police come.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin looked at her husband with incredulity. How could he hope to lose himself in the hills back of Honolulu, when the police would be on his trail within six hours and when every Hawaiian who saw two Chinese struggling through the trails would know they were mai Pake? It was ridiculous, insane, as impractical as the reliance upon the quack doctor, and she was about to tell him so, but then she looked in a new way at her quixotic husband and saw him as a temporary assembly of earth and bone and confused desire and a pigtail and hands that would soon fall apart with leprosy. He was a man who could be very wise and the next minute quite stupid, as now; he was a human being who loved children and old people but who was often forgetful of those his own age. He was a mercurial gambler charged with hope: he had hoped that the quack doctor could cure him; now he hoped that somehow the forests would hide him. But above all he was her man: even though he was a Punti he had chosen her as his woman, and she loved him more than she loved her own sons. If he had this crazy desire to try his luck once more in the hills, she would go with him, for he was an obstinate man and sometimes a foolish one, but he was a man who deserved to be loved.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was two o’clock in the morning when Nyuk Tsin finished hiding in high places anything that might hurt her children. Then she went to each child as he slept on the long polished board and fixed his clothes, so that in the morning when the boys were discovered, they would be presentable, and she straightened her bed. Then she took her husband’s hand and led him out the Whipple gate and up toward the mountains back of Oahu. She did not depart unnoticed, for Dr. Whipple, unable to sleep, had kept watch on the Chinese quarters, suspecting an attempted flight, but when it eventuated, and he saw the thin little Chinese woman guiding her doomed husband toward the hills, he could not bring himself to stop them or to sound an alarm, and when she carefully returned to close his gate lest his dogs escape, he prayed: “May God have mercy upon those who hope.” At first he was inclined to go down and bring the Chinese babies into the house, but he thought: “That might arouse somebody. Anyway, I’m sure Nyuk Tsin left them in good condition.” So he sat by the window, guarding the house where the babies slept.</p>

  <p class="normal">But after a while his New England conscience, undaunted by forty-eight years in the tropics, made him reason: “The children must not be left in that contaminated house another minute. Rescue now might save them from the disease, whereas an hour’s delay might give it to them,” so in the darkness before dawn he led his wife to the Chinese house, gently wakened the children so as not to frighten them, undressed them so that not a shred of their old garments came with them, and carried them into the Whipple home.</p>

  <p class="normal">When this was done, Dr. Whipple studied his watch and thought: “Nyuk Tsin and her man have had two hours’ lead. It will be all right to call the policemen,” and he sent a servant after the officials. When they arrived he reported: “Mun Ki has leprosy. We must burn the house and everything in it,” and with his own matches he ignited both the Chinese house and the cooking shed. Then, pointing to the Nuuanu Valley, he said, “I think they headed for those hills.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Throughout the morning he expected the police to appear with the two Chinese, but their capture was delayed. The afternoon also passed, and so did the evening, without the Whipple servants’ being apprehended. This seemed strange to the doctor, and early next morning he inquired of the police what had happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s no trace of them,” the officers explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sure they went up the Nuuanu,” Dr. Whipple assured them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If they did, they vanished,” the police replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">An ugly thought came to the doctor and he asked, “Did you look at the foot of the Pali?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We thought of suicide,” the police assured him, “and we studied the Pali rocks, but they didn’t jump.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Day by day the mystery deepened. Nyuk Tsin and her dream-spinning husband had accomplished the miracle Mun Ki had relied upon: they had fled to the mountains and had somehow disappeared. Fortunately, the quack herbalist and his two spies had had the good luck to report Nyuk Tsin’s suspicious behavior to the police before Dr. Whipple did: “We are sure she is hiding her husband, who is mai Pake.” So they got their reward, and the herbalist often pointed out to his friends: “If I had waited till next morning, the leper would have been gone and I would have received nothing. This proves that it is always best to perform your duty promptly and let the sluggards lie abed lazily till the next convenient day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the end of a week the police came again to Dr. Whipple and confessed: “We’ve been to every grass house between here and the other seacoast. No Chinese. We’ve been wondering if your servants could have doubled back and gone into hiding somewhere right around here. You spoke of arrangements made by the woman to give her children away. Which families did she choose?”</p>

  <p class="normal">A minute search of those premises also failed to reveal the fugitives, so the police said, “We are faced by a mystery. Somehow Nyuk Tsin and her husband have made themselves invisible.” And so as far as active energy was concerned, the official search for the leper ended.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the night that Nyuk Tsin led her husband through the Whipple gate, and then turned back to close it lest the dogs escape, she walked rapidly toward the mountains, and as she stepped boldly forth Mun Ki, trailing a few paces behind, could not help seeing her big, unbound feet and he thought: “On a night like this it’s all right for a woman to have such feet.” But reflection on this ancient problem that separated the Punti and the Hakka served to remind him of the mournful fact that he would never again see his village, and he grew disconsolate and lost his optimism and said, “It will soon be morning, and they will find us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His wife, who originally had advised against this ridiculous attempt to escape, now became the one who urged her husband on, assuring him: “If we can get even to the lower hills before dawn, we will be safe,” and she began to formulate stratagems, one of which she put into effect as dawn broke.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will hide beneath those thickets,” she said, “close to the road where no one will look.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All day?” her irresolute husband asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. There’s a trickle of water running through and I have some balls of cold rice.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They approached the thicket from a roundabout way, so as not to leave footprints leading into it, and when daylight brought travelers to the road, none saw the leper and his kokua. Nor did the police when they hurried past. Nor did the children on their way to school. All day stout-hearted Nyuk Tsin kept her man hidden, and for long periods they slept, but when Mun Ki was sleeping and his wife was awake, she was distraught by the manner in which her man shivered, for leprosy seemed to be accompanied by a slow fever that kept an infected man forever cold and stricken with trembling.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Nyuk Tsin wakened her husband, counted her rice balls, and started on up the mountainside. She did not know where she was going, for she was impelled by only one driving consideration: the longer they evaded the police, the longer they were free; and such a simple doctrine anyone could understand. They grew hungry, cold and weak, but she drove them both on, and in this manner they escaped capture for three days, but they approached starvation and exhaustion.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have no more strength to walk,” the sick man protested. “I will lend you my shoulders,” Nyuk Tsin replied, and that night, with Mun Ki hanging on to his wife’s back, but using his own sick legs to walk whenever he could, they made some progress toward their unknown goal, but it was cruelly evident that this was the last night Mun Ki could move, so when morning came his wife bedded him down in a hidden ravine, washed his face with cold water running out of the hills, and set forth to find some food.</p>

  <p class="normal">That day it rained, and while Nyuk Tsin sloshed through the mountains gathering roots and trying vainly to trap a bird, her afflicted husband shivered on the cold ground while surface water crept in below his shoulders and hips, soon making him wet and colder still. It was a dismal, hungry night, with a handful of roots to chew and not even a remnant of hope to rely upon; and it became Mun Ki’s intention, when morning came, to crawl out to the highway and wait until the searching police found him.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Nyuk Tsin had other plans, and in the hour before dawn she told her shivering husband, “Wu Chow’s Father, stay here and I promise you that I shall return with food and help.” She smoothed the damp earth about him and saw with dismay that it was going to rain again that day, but she told him to be of cheer, for she would soon return. Crawling carefully among the trees parallel to the highway, she looked for narrow trails leading off into the hills, and after a while she came upon one, well trod, and this she followed for several hundred yards until she came upon a clearing in which an almost-collapsed grass shack stood, with a three-hundred-pound Hawaiian woman sitting happily in front. Cautiously, but with confidence, Nyuk Tsin walked down the path to greet the huge woman, but before the Chinese maid could speak in explanation of her unexpected appearance in the clearing, the big Hawaiian woman asked, “Are you the Chinese who is mai Pake?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My husband, hidden in the ravine, is the one,” Nyuk Tsin replied in Hawaiian.</p>

  <p class="normal">The big woman began to rock back and forth on her unsteady chair, lamenting, “Auwe, auwe! It is so terrible, the mai Pake.’ Then she looked at the Chinese and said, “For three days the police have been here every day, searching for you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could you please let us have some food?” Nyuk Tsin begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” the big woman cried. “We don’t have much. Kimo!” she called unexpectedly, and from the lowly grass house a big, fat, lazy Hawaiian man appeared, with no shirt and a pair of almost disintegrating sailor’s pants held up by a length of rope. He was not shaved or washed and apparently he had slept in his pants for several months, but he had a huge, amiable, grinning face.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it, Apikela?” he asked, using her Biblical name Abigail.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The mai Pake is hiding in the ravine,” Apikela explained. “He hasn’t eaten for four days.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We better get him some food!” Kimo, the Biblical James, replied. And he hurried back into the grass house and soon reappeared with a ti leaf full of poi, some baked breadfruit and a few chunks of coconut. “No rice,” he joked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll take it to the sick man,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll go with you,” Kimo volunteered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It isn’t necessary,” Nyuk Tsin protested, for she did not want to involve these kind people with the police.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How are you going to carry him back here?” Kimo demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin could scarcely believe the words she was hearing. Without looking at Kimo she asked softly, “Then I can hide him here … for a few days?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” Apikela laughed, rocking back and forth. “Those damned police!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s a terrible thing to catch sick men and send them to a lonely island,” Kimo agreed. “If a man’s going to die, let him die with his friends. He’s soon gone, and nobody is poorer.” He wrapped up the food and said, “Show me where the poor fellow is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But now Apikela rose and said, “No, Kimo, I’ll go. If police are on the road it will be better if I am the one they question. Because I can claim I’m on my way to work, and if they come here it will look less suspicious if you are asleep in the house as usual.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kimo considered this logic for a moment and agreed with his shrewd wife that things would give a better appearance if the day’s routine were not broken, so he went back to bed; fat Apikela marched slowly down the path; and Nyuk Tsin kept up with her by creeping through the rain forest, and the two women had progressed only a little way when Apikela stopped, motioned to the Chinese and said, “It would seem more reasonable if I had two chains of maile about my neck. Go back and ask Kimo for them.” And when the huge woman had placed the spicy maile leaves about her shoulders, the procession resumed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her strategy was a good one, for when she reached the highway, with Nyuk Tsin cowering behind in the forest, police came by on horses and asked, “Have you seen the mai Pake Chinese?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” she replied blandly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are you doing abroad so early, Apikela?”</p>

  <a id="section_2"></a>

  <p class="normal">“Gathering maile vines, as usual,” she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">They saw the vines and believed. “If you see the Chinese in your clearing, come out to the road and report them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will,” the gigantic woman agreed, and slowly she moved on down the road.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Nyuk Tsin ran ahead, and it was fortunate that she did so, for when she reached the spot where she had left her husband, she saw that Mun Ki had disappeared, and she experienced a moment of despair, but she was soon able to pick up his tracks through the muddy leaves and she guessed that he was headed toward the highway, to give himself up. In panic Nyuk Tsin followed his trail and saw him just as he was about to climb an embankment and cry to passing strangers. Leaping ahead, she dashed up behind him and caught his legs, grappling with him and dragging him back down into the forest. “I have brought you food,” she gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?” he asked, sure that his wife’s empty hands proved the hoax.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There!” Nyuk Tsin replied, and through the trees that edged the highway she pointed to the figure of a huge woman, rolling and wheezing along in a tentlike brown dress made of Boston fabric. She wore maile chains about her neck and an unconcerned, happy smile upon her enormous brown face.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who’s that?” Mun Ki whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Apikela,” his wife replied, and darted out to haul the Hawaiian maile-gatherer into the forest. The big woman looked at the leper’s sad condition and tears came into her eyes. Handing Nyuk Tsin the bundle of food, she gathered the scrawny Chinese to her capacious bosom and whispered, “We will take care of you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For nearly a month Apikela and her slothful husband Kimo sequestered the Chinese, sharing with them their meager supplies of food. Because there were now four to feed, Apikela had to go each day into the forest to gather maile, which her husband prepared for market by skillfully slitting the bark, cutting out the pithy core, and leaving a fragrant supple vine that could be woven into leis. Periodically he lugged the maile into Honolulu, peddling it among the flower merchants. With the money thus gained he would shoot a few games of pool, buy some breadfruit, a little pork and some rice. Since Hawaiians rarely ate rice, this purchase occasioned comment, which Kimo rebuffed by observing, “I’m switching to rice so I’ll be smart, like a Pake.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Once when big, lazy Kimo ambled home with rice, Nyuk Tsin bit her lip and asked, “Why do you do this for us, Kimo?” And Apikela interrupted, saying, “When we were children going to the church we were often told of how Jesus loved the lepers, and it was a test of all good men how they treated those who were sick. And no leper ever came to Jesus without receiving aid, and no leper will come to the house of Kimo and Apikela to be turned away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much longer can we hide here?” Nyuk Tsin asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Until the man dies,” Apikela said resolutely.</p>

  <p class="normal">And they lived like this for another week, and then a spy in the Honolulu store put two and two together, reasoning: “Kimo never before sold such amounts of maile. And he never bought rice, either. It is Kimo who is hiding the mai Pake Chinese!” And this man hurried to the police and told them, “I am certain that Kimo and Apikela, in the clearing up toward the Pali, are hiding the mai Pake.” So the spy got a good reward for his ability to think cleverly, and that afternoon the police crept in upon the clearing. When they charged out, Nyuk Tsin grabbed a frail stick and tried desperately to fight them off, and big Apikela tried to wrestle with them, and Kimo shouted, “Who was the evil man who betrayed us?” But weak and shivering Mun Ki walked out of the little near-collapsing grass shack and gave himself up. The police were so pleased with having taken the fugitives that they started immediately to hustle them away, but Nyuk Tsin cried in Hawaiian, “Let us at least thank these good people,” but she was not allowed this courtesy, and as she was dragged down the path and onto the highway she looked back and saw the two enormous Hawaiians weeping as their friends were hauled into final custody.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Dr. Whipple heard that his Chinese servants had been captured, he hurried to the leper station, where the afflicted were assembled for shipment to their outcast island, and sought out Nyuk Tsin and her husband. “I wish you had escaped,” he told them in Hawaiian. “I am sorry to see you here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you taken the children to their homes?” Nyuk Tsin asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you determined to be a kokua?” Whipple countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re free to leave here, if you wish. Until the boat sails.” He drove her to his home and showed her the four children, fat and happy in American clothes. She started to laugh and said, “They don’t look like Chinese.” She gathered them up and said that she would walk with them to their new homes, but Dr. Whipple piled them into his carriage, and they started forth on their unpleasant mission. At the first house, a Punti’s, she delivered a son and said, “Bring him up to be a good man.” The Punti replied, “It will be difficult, but we’ll try.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the second house, a Hakka’s, she said, “Teach him to speak all the languages,” and the Hakka grudgingly took the child. At the third, another Punti’s, she begged: “Bring him up to honor his father.” And at the last house, another Hakka’s, she warned again: “Teach him to speak all the languages.” Then she asked the doctor to drive her to the Hewlett home, and there she found the cook and his wife and spoke of the child that was not yet born, and she said to the Punti, “You are to keep this child as your own. Give it your name. Teach it to revere you as its just parents.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When will the child get here?” the people asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As soon as a ship leaves from the leper island,” Nyuk Tsin replied, and the intended parents shivered with apprehension.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the way back to the quarantine station, Dr. Whipple drove a short distance up Nuuanu Valley to the land which he had given Nyuk Tsin. Placing stones at the corners of a seven-acre field, he assured her, “Mrs. Kee, I have entered this plot at the land court and paid taxes on it. When your husband dies, because he can’t live much longer, you come back here and start a little garden and get your children back with you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From the carriage Nyuk Tsin looked at the wet land, and it seemed impossibly beautiful to her. “I will remember this land,” she said in Hawaiian.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when Dr. Whipple started to turn the horses around, he saw coming toward him two huge Hawaiians, and when they detected Nyuk Tsin in the carriage, they cried, “Pake, Pake! We have come for the children!”</p>

  <p class="normal">They ran as fast as their enormous bulk permitted and caught hold of their friend’s hands. “Surely you will let us keep the children for you,” they pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have such a small house,” Nyuk Tsin protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s big enough for children!” Apikela cried expansively, opening her arms like swinging gates. “Please, Pake wahine! You’ll let us have the children?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin spent some time considering this strange request, and she wished that Mun Ki were present to help her, but she was sure he would approve her conclusion: “The Punti and the Hakka families might grow weary of our children, even though we are all from the Carthaginian. But Apikela and Kimo will love them forever.” So Nyuk Tsin spoke for her family: “We will give the children to you.” And she asked Dr. Whipple to drive back to the houses where the children were and she explained to the Chinese: “It will be better this way because Apikela and Kimo will be able to keep all the children together. But I hope, for my husband’s sake, that you will give them some money from time to time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Money? For keeping children?” fat Apikela asked in astonishment, and Nyuk Tsin thought how strange it was that Chinese families with good jobs always found it difficult to accept one strange child, but Hawaiians who had nothing could invariably find space for one child, or three, or five. She last saw her boys heading back up the Pali, one baby in Apikela’s arms, one in Kimo’s, and the two older boys trudging happily behind.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the time came for the panel of doctors to certify that Mun Ki was indeed a leper, and therefore subject to banishment for life without right of appeal, they reported: “Aggravated case of leprosy. Lesions both external and internal. Banishment to Kalawao imperative.” The papers were signed. The three doctors left, and Whipple said to the condemned man, “Mun Ki, wherever a human being goes, there is a challenge. Be the best man you can, and your gods will look with favor upon you. And may my God in His heaven protect you. Good-bye.” Bowed with the grief that comes upon all men who watch the swinging changes of life, Dr. John Whipple went home.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two days later forty condemned lepers were assembled and marched through the streets of Honolulu toward the pier where the leper ship, Kihuea, waited. As the ghostly men and women walked, the citizens of the city drew back in horror, for some hobbled along on feet that had no toes and other stared vacantly ahead from horrible faces that had no cheeks and whose lips and noses had fallen away. In silence the doomed lepers approached the Kilauea, a small, snout-nosed little craft of four hundred tons with a grimy smokestack and filthy decks. Forward, some cattle had been tethered for the short, rough haul to the leper colony, and as the ship rocked slowly these beasts lowed mournfully. When the lepers appeared, a gangplank was lowered and nauseated policemen herded the doomed men and women aboard; but when the final moment came when the lepers were to be cut off forever from their families, a monstrous wailing began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Auwe, auwe!” howled women whose husbands were being dragged away.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Farewell, my son!” an old man shouted, his face bathed in tears.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We shall meet in heaven, by the cool waters!” wept a sister whose brother was being shoved onto the ugly ship, this unimpressive ferry to hell.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Auwe, auwe!” mourned the multitude of watchers as they watched the stricken ones slowly climb the gangplank, overcome by terror and shaking.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a sense, the lamentation of those on shore was traditional and formalized; but the sounds that now emitted from the decks of the Kilauea were not, for the hopeless lepers lined the railings of the ship and cried back their piteous farewells. Condemned women waved with hands that bore no fingers. Men cried good-bye from faces that had no recognizable features. Some of the lepers were too far progressed in the disease to be able to stand by themselves, and they wailed without purpose, adding their cries to the general lament.</p>

  <p class="normal">But occasionally, among the forty victims, one would appear whose countenance or character aroused in all an instinctive outburst of sorrow. The first such harrowing case was that of a bright little girl about ten years old who had left the pier with not a member of her family present to bid her farewell. On her face beginning sores were visible as she hurried up the gangplank, and it was obvious to all that she would soon be completely ravaged by the disease, but in wonder and confusion she stepped onto the gently swaying deck of the Kilauea, not able to comprehend the awful step she was taking.</p>

  <p class="normal">Out of compassion an older woman, also condemned to exile, leaned down to comfort the girl, but when the child saw the awful chinless face coming toward her, she screamed, not realizing that soon she would look the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next case was that of a man well known for his swimming prowess, a big, handsome fellow with broad chest and strong arms. Many came to see him leave for the island from which no leper had ever returned, and as he stood at the head of the gangplank, turning back to wave his hands at his friends, showing them fingers with the first joints already eaten away, the misery of his condition infected everyone and cries of “Auwe, auwe!” sounded. This communion of sorrow affected him, and he hid his face, whereupon the weeping increased.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the third case was entirely different, so dreadful that it occasioned no public display of sorrow. It was that of a very lovely young wife, with flowers in her hair, on whose body no one could identify the fatal marks. Her feet were clean and her fingers, too. There was no infection on her face, but her eyes were glassy, so the well-informed crowd knew that here was one in whom the sickness lay accumulating its strength inside, ready to erupt generally in one massive sore. The death of this girl would be horrible, a total disintegration, and those who watched her walking slowly and with grace up the gangplank kept their sorrow to themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">But she was not to depart in peace, for her husband broke from the crowd of watchers and tried to dash up the gangplank after her, shouting, “Kinau, Kinau, I will be your kokua.” Guards restrained him, and his wife Kinau, named after one of Hawaii’s most able queens, looked back down the gangplank and with visible compassion cried, “You may not join me, Kealaikahiki.” And with considerable dignity she stepped onto the Kilauea and ordered the guards to drag her husband away. Impassively, she watched him go, and if she heard his frantic cries, She did not indicate the fact, and he disappeared from the dock altogether, crying, “Kinau! Kinau! I shall be your kokua.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the doomed Hawaiians were all aboard, the police produced the Chinese Kee Mun Ki, and since the disease from which he suffered was known as the mai Pake, the crowd somehow understood that he personally was the cause of this day’s tragedy, and they mumbled strongly against him. Alone, looking neither right nor left, he passed through the hostile groups until at last he stood at the gangplank, and then two huge Hawaiians hurried forward to bid him good-bye. They were Kimo and his wife Apikela, and without fear they embraced the leper, kissed him on the cheeks, and bade him farewell. With some relief, the thin, shivering Chinese man walked up the gangplank. He had hoped, on this last journey, that Dr. Whipple would be present to bid him good-bye, but the doctor could no longer suffer the sight of people whom he had helped condemn taking their last farewells. Among the group sailing that day were more than twenty upon whose investigating boards he had sat, and he could not bear to see them go, partly at his command. On days when the Kilauea sailed, he stayed home and prayed.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Mun Ki was safely aboard, the captain shouted, “Open the cage!” And two sailors went aft to a wicker cage that had been built on the deck of the leper ship, and they swung back on its hinges a latticed gate, and when it was open, other sailors, careful not to touch the lepers, growled, “All right! All right! Get in!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The cage was not large, nor was the door high, and one by one the condemned people stooped, crawled in, and found their places. The wicker gate was lashed shut, whereupon the captain called down reassuringly, “There will be a man stationed by you at all times. If we start to sink, he’ll cut open the gate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">While this encagement of the lepers was under way, two other sailors had appeared with buckets of soapy water and now proceeded to wash down the handrails of the gangplank, after which normal passengers were allowed to board, and when they had hurried below to escape the smell of the forty caged lepers the captain shouted, “All right! Kokuas aboard!”</p>

  <p class="normal">From the wailing crowd some dozen Hawaiians, men and women alike, stepped forward and in a kind of spiritual daze groped for the clean handrails of the gangplank. They were the kokuas, that strange band of people who in Hawaii in the later years of the nineteenth century proved that the word love had a tangible reality, and as each kokua reached the deck of the Kilauea a police marshal asked carefully, “Are you sure you know what you are doing in volunteering for the lazaretto?” And one man replied, “I would rather go with my wife to the lazaretto than stay here free without her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">No one, looking at the kokuas, could have predicted that these particular people would have been so moved by love. True, there were some old women whose lives were nearly spent and it was understandable that they should join the leprous men with whom they had lived so long; and there were older men who had married young women who had fallen prey to the disease, and it was also understandable that these men might prefer to remain with their girls; but there were also men and women of the most indiscriminate sort who climbed the gangplank to embrace other women and men of no apparent attraction whatever, so that the people on the dock had to ask themselves: “Why would a man in good health volunteer for the lazaretto in order to be with such a woman?” And to this question there was no answer except the word love.</p>

  <p class="normal">No kokua came to stand beside the little ten-year-old girl, and none came to be with the beautiful Kinau. But there was general surprise when the police dropped their arms and allowed the Chinese woman, Nyuk Tsin, to join her husband, and as she reached the gangplank, once more the two huge Hawaiians, Kimo and Apikela, stepped forward to embrace her, and Apikela placed about the sloping shoulders of her yellow-skinned friend a chain of maile, saying, “We will love your children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The gangplank was hauled aboard. The cattle tethered forward began lowing pitifully. The crowd ashore started shouting, “Auwe, auwe!” and the Kilauea stood out to sea with its horrible burden. When Dr. Whipple, inland in his study, heard the whistle blow farewell, he prayed, “Oh, may God have mercy upon them.” For he alone, of all who heard the whistle blowing, understood what lay ahead for Nyuk Tsin and Mun Ki. He had seen the lazaretto.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>THE ISLAND</span> of Molokai, to which the caged lepers were heading, was one of the most strangely beautiful islands in the Hawaiian group. It lay in the blue Pacific like a huge left-handed gauntlet, the open wristlet facing westward toward the island of Oahu, the cupped fingers pointing eastward toward Maui. The southern portion of Molokai consisted of rolling meadowland, often with gray and parched grasses, for rainfall was slight, while the northern portion was indented by some of the most spectacular cliffs in the islands. For mile after mile these towering structures rose from the crashing surf, sometimes reaching more than three thousand feet into the air, their faces sheer rock, their flanks marked by dozens upon dozens of shimmering waterfalls. These cliffs formed, at their bases, delectable valleys that probed inland half a mile to end in soaring walls of granite, but narrow and restricted though they were, these valleys were perhaps the finest in Hawaii. Upon the cliffs white goats ranged, so that a boat coasting the north shore of Molokai passed constantly beneath magnificent cliffs, trembling waterfalls and the antics of a thousand goats. Sailors, when the days were idle, would discharge guns aimlessly at the cliffs to make the goats scamper up walls of rock that no man could have negotiated. Thus, the uninhabitable north coast of Molokai was completely cut off from the gentle meadows of the south coast, where some two thousand normal islanders lived.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jutting out from the isolated yet magnificent northern coast stood the thumb of the gauntlet, a small, verdant peninsula that had been formed millions of years later than the main island, for when the initial volcanoes that accounted for Molokai had long since died away, an afterthought-eruption occurred offshore. It did not rise from a major volcano, nor did it build a major island; it was content merely to add a peninsula of lovely proportions, from whose grassy shores one could look west and east toward the towering cliffs. It was a majestic spot, a poem of nature, and from the earliest memories of Hawaiian history, fortunate fishermen had lived here, building themselves a good community and calling it Kalawao.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then in 1865, the year in which the Kees left China, the Hawaiian government tardily faced up to the fact that in the strange new disease called mai Pake it faced an epidemic of the most virulent sort. It was ironic that leprosy should have been named the Chinese sickness, for the scourge neither came from China nor did it especially affect the Chinese, but some kind of quarantine was necessary, and the heavenly peninsula of Kalawao was nominated to be the lazaretto. It was generally known that leprosy was contagious but no one knew of a cure; so in frenzied eagerness to take some kind of action, the government’s medical advisers said: “At least we can isolate the afflicted.” In desperation the lepers were hunted down; the Hawaiians living at Kalawao were exiled forever from their peninsula; and the Kilauea started its dismal voyages to the lazaretto. In the previous history of the world no such hellish spot had ever stood in such heavenly surroundings.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the first day of November, 1870, the ferry Kilauea stood off the eastern edge of the peninsula, dropped anchor some hundred yards from the cliff-lined shore and rolled with the surf beneath the leaping goats. The captain ordered one section of the deck railing removed, and sailors began shoving into the sea huge casks of salt beef, cured salmon and dehydrated poi. When the cargo was thus thrown into the waves, lepers from Kalawao swam out to the ship and started guiding the stores to shore, for the colony had no pier at which supplies could be landed in an orderly way.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now from the front of the ship cattle were led aft, and amidst great bellowing were shoved into the ocean where swimming lepers leaped upon their backs and guided them to shore. Occasionally a frightened cow would toss her rider and head for the open sea, but stout swimmers would overtake her and force her toward the land. A sailor, tiring of the sport provided by the swimmers, discharged his musket aimlessly at the cliffs, and from their cage the lepers saw wild goats leap up the cliffs like the flight of song, flying from crag to crag, and these white animals became the symbol of a freedom forever lost to them.</p>

  <p class="normal">A longboat was lowered, with three sailors at the oars, and the police marshal who had accompanied the lepers, ordered the cage opened, and called off names, and saw each afflicted man and woman into the boat. There the government’s responsibility ended, for the policeman did not enter the boat himself. He watched it move toward the shore, dump its human cargo on the beach, and return. Then he checked off another complement, and in this way the forty lepers were thrown ashore with no stores of clothing, no money, no food and no medicine.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the condemned were all ashore, the marshal announced formally to the kokuas: “You are now free to accompany your husbands and wives, but you do so of your own free will. The government has no concern in what you are about to do. Is it your wish to go ashore and live with the lepers?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The kokuas, staring with horrified fascination at the lazaretto, could barely scrape their tongues with words. “I am willing,” an old man rasped, and he climbed down into the boat. “I am willing,” a young wife reported, and with trepidation she went down. Finally the marshal asked Nyuk Tsin, “Do you do this thing of your own free will?” and she replied, “I am willing.” The longboat set out for shore, and Nyuk Tsin approached the leper settlement at Kalawao.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was surprised to see, as the green peninsula drew near, that it contained practically no houses, and she asked one of the rowers, in Hawaiian, “Where are the houses?” And he replied, unable to look her in the eyes, “There are no houses.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And there were none … to speak of. There were a few grass huts, a few remnants of homes left by the Hawaiians who had been expelled five years before, but there were no houses as such, nor any hospital, nor store, nor government building, nor functioning church, nor roads, nor doctors, nor nurses. In panic Nyuk Tsin stared at the inviting natural setting and looked for signs of community life. There were no police, no officials of any kind, no ministers, no mothers with families, no one selling cloth, no one making poi.</p>

  <p class="normal">The prow of the longboat struck shore, but no one moved. The sailors waited and then one said, as if ashamed to be part of this dismal scene, “This is Kalawao.” Appalled by what faced them, the kokuas rose and left the boat. “Aloha,” the sailor cried as the boat withdrew for the last time. The Kilauea put back out to sea, and Nyuk Tsin, trying to find Mun Ki among the stranded lepers, cried to no one: “Where is the hospital?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Her plea was heard by a big, tall Hawaiian man known to the lepers as Kaulo Nui, Big Saul of the Bible. He had no nose and few fingers, but he was still a powerful man, and he came to Nyuk Tsin and shouted in Hawaiian, “Here there is no law. There is nothing but what I command.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The newcomers were as frightened by this state of affairs as was Nyuk Tsin, but Big Saul ignored them, and pointing his mutilated hand at the Chinese couple, said, “You brought the mai Pake! You will live apart.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?” Nyuk Tsin asked boldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Apart,” the big man said. Then his eye fell on the young wife Kinau, who still had flowers in her hair, and he moved toward her, announcing: “This woman is for me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kinau drew back in horror from the huge, noseless man whose hands were so badly deformed. She shuddered, and Big Saul saw this, so to teach her the required lesson, he grabbed her by the left arm, pulled her to him, and kissed her on the mouth. “You’re my woman!” he announced again.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin expected to see someone--who, she could not guess-- step forward to knock the big man down, but when none did, the awful fact of Kalawao slowly dawned upon her, as it did upon all the others. Big Saul, holding onto the shuddering Kinau, glared at the newcomers and repeated the news: “Here there is no law.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor was there any. In all of Kalawao there was no voice of government, no voice of God, no healing medicine. In the houseless peninsula there was not even a secure supply of water, and food was available only when the Kilauea remembered to kick into the sea enough casks and cattle. In truth, the lepers had been thrown ashore with nothing except the sentence of certain death, and what they did until they died, no man cared.</p>

  <p class="normal">If any of the newcomers thought differently, they were disabused by what happened next, for Kinau was an uncommonly pretty girl, and the fact that she had no open lesions made her extraordinary in the doomed community, so that Big Saul and his rowdier companions became excited by her beauty and could not wait till nightfall, when such things usually occurred, and three of them dragged her behind a wall that still stood, a remnant of a house where a family of fishermen had once lived, and the two who joined Big Saul were among the most loathsome of the group, for their bodies were falling away, but they thought: “We have been thrown away by Hawaii. No one cares and we shall soon be dead.” So they dragged Kinau behind the wall and started, with their fragmentary hands, to tear away her clothes.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please! Please!” she begged, but nothing could be done to interrupt the three hungry men, and when she was naked they admired her, and pinched her body and explored it and laughed, and then in turn two held her down while the other mounted her, and in time she fainted.</p>

  <p class="normal">For five days Big Saul and his cronies kept her to themselves, after which any others who thought themselves strong enough to force their way into the group were free to join, and when they saw the naked Kinau, as yet unblemished, they were hungry with old memories of the days when they were whole men, and they cared nothing about what they did.</p>

  <p class="normal">Occasionally Big Saul left the girl, to make decisions as to how the lepers should dispose themselves, and he was adamant that the Chinese must stay apart, so Nyuk Tsin and her husband were forced to live at the outer edge of the community of six hundred dying men and women. For the first six days they slept on bare earth; and they found an abandoned wall against which they built a rough lean-to, using shrubs and leaves, for there was no lumber of any kind. For their bed they had only raw earth, and when rain came it crept under them so that Mun Ki, already shivering with ague, came close to dying of pneumonia. Then Nyuk Tsin, using her bare hands, for there were no implements, scraped together a platform of earth and covered it with twigs and leaves, and this made a bed into which the water could not creep unless the rainfall was unusually heavy.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two outlawed Chinese were forbidden access to the food barrels until all others had partaken, and even then Big Saul decreed that they live on half-rations, and if it had not been for Nyuk Tsin’s resourcefulness they would have starved. On the reef she found small edible snails, and in one of the deserted valleys she discovered dryland taro that had gone wild. With twigs she collected from the cliffs she built a small underground oven in which she baked the taro, so that life apart from the others had minor compensations. Certainly, the Kees lived better than the pathetic lepers who could no longer walk.</p>

  <p class="normal">In Kalawao in 1870 there were over sixty such unspeakable persons: their feet had fallen away, their hands were stumps, and they crawled about the settlement begging food which they themselves could neither obtain nor prepare. Horrifying echoes of humanity, they often had no faces whatever, excepting eyes and voices with which to haunt the memories of those who came upon them. There was no medicine for them, no bed, no care of any kind. They crawled along the beach of Kalawao and in God’s due time they died. Usually they did not even find a grave, but were left aside until their bones were cleaned and could be laid in a shallow ditch.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sometimes the authorities in Honolulu forgot to send the Kilauea with replenishments of food, and then1 the settlement degenerated into absolute terror. Big Saul and his cronies commandeered whatever supplies remained, and protected their rights with violence. The death rate soared, four or five cases each day, and a legless woman might lie in the path all day screaming for food and water, and no one would listen to her, hoping that in the cold night she would die. And usually she did, and her tormented body might lie there, just as she had left it, for a day or even three, until Big Saul commanded someone to remove it.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no law in Kalawao and there was almost no humanity. What made the situation doubly terrible was that regularly the ugly little ferryboat Kilauea appeared offshore with an additional cargo of lepers, and when they were thrown ashore with nothing, Big Saul would move among them telling them the ultimate, terrifying truth: “Here there is no law.”</p>

  <p class="normal">After six weeks of keeping the beautiful young wife Kinau a prisoner, during which time more than eighteen men enjoyed her unmarked body, she was turned loose for whoever wanted her. She was allowed one flimsy dress, but the way in which she wore it proved that she had by God’s grace lost her mind. She could remember nothing of what had happened to her, and she walked in a daze, unable to focus on the present, so that for a space of three or four months whatever man wanted her simply grabbed her and took her to where he slept on the cold earth and played with her for as long as he wished. Then he shoved her along, and she moved like a ghost, her dress askew and no flowers in her matted hair, until some other man wanted her, and then she was his. The women of Kalawao felt sorry for her, but each had her own problem, so that no one tended the poor crazy girl.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the fourth month, in February of 1871, that is, the virulent leprosy that abided in Kinau broke loose, and within the space of a few weeks she became a horribly riddled thing, a walking corpse with thick, bloated face, shivering lips about to fall away and sickening illness in her breasts. Now men left her alone, but in her dementia she took off her flimsy dress and exposed the sores of her body. She walked slowly from Big Saul to his first lieutenant and then on to his second, whimpering, “Now I should like to lie with you again.” She became such a sore on the community that men could not stand seeing her approach, her body falling apart, and finally Big Saul said, “Somebody ought to knock that one on the head.” So on a dark night, somebody did, and she lay dead in the path for two days before she was finally dragged away for burial.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course, no woman was safe on Kalawao, for Big Saul and his men were free to take whom they liked, and those who arrived on the beach with no men to protect them suffered grievously, for they were ‘usually women not far advanced in the disease, and to be raped repeatedly by men with no faces or with hands eroded to stumps was unbearable, but there was no escape, and Kalawao was filled with women who fell into a kind of stupor, crying to themselves, “Why has God punished me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">It must not be assumed that women were blameless for the degeneration that overtook Kalawao, for there were many presentable women who felt: “I have been abandoned by society. There is no law here and no one cares what I do.” Such women helped the men brew a raw and savage liquor from roots of the ti plant, or muddy beer from stewed sweet potatoes, and for weeks at a time, whole sections of the leper population stayed madly drunk, coursing loudly through the settlement, brawling, screaming indecencies at the general population and winding up in some public place naked and lustful, there to indulge themselves with one another to the applause of cheering witnesses. Those who inflamed these orgies and who seemed to enjoy them most were women, and it was not uncommon in those days, when no priests or ministers or government officials were present to protect order, to see a half-naked woman, at the end of a nine-day drunk, stagger into a public place and cry, “I can have intercourse with any four men here, and when I’m through with them, they’ll be half dead.” And volunteers would leap at the offer, and there would be a wild, insane testing to see if she could make good her challenge, and when she was finished, she would fall asleep in a drunken, exhausted stupor, right on the ground where she lay, and the night rains would come and no one would cover her, and after a few years she would die, not of leprosy, but of tuberculosis.</p>

  <p class="normal">If anyone in those years had wished to see humanity at its positive lowest, humanity wallowing in filth of its own creation, he would have had to visit Kalawao, for not only was the peninsula cursed by leprosy; it was also scarred by human stupidity. The peninsula had two sides, an eastern where cold winds blew and rain fell incessantly, and a western where the climate was both warm and congenial; but the leper colony had been started on the inclement eastern shore, and there the government insisted that it be kept while the kindly western shore remained unpopulated. The eastern location, being close to the towering cliffs, received its first sunlight late in the day and lost it early in the afternoon; but on the western slope there was adequate sun. Most ridiculous of all, even though the cliffs threw down a hundred waterfalls, none had been channeled into the leper settlement. At first a little had been brought down by an inadequate, tied-together pipe, but it had long since broken, so that all water had to be lugged by hand several miles, and often dying people with no kokuas to help them would spend their last four or five days pleading helplessly for a drink which they were never given. For six indifferent years no official in Honolulu found time to concern himself with such problems or allocate even miserly sums to their solution. In ancient times it had been said, “Out of sight, out of mind,” and rarely in human history had this calloused apothegm been more concisely illustrated than at the Kalawao lazaretto. The government had decreed: “The lepers shall be banished,” as if saying the words and imprisoning the leprous bodies somehow solved the problem.</p>

  <p class="normal">IT <span>WOULD NOT</span> be fair, however, to say that during these appalling first years no one cared. Brave Christian ministers from other islands sometimes visited Kalawao to solemnize marriages of dying people who did not wish to live their last days in sin. Catholic priests and Mormon disciples occasionally made the rough crossing to the lazaretto, and their arrivals were remembered long after they had left. Dr. Whipple had come, at the age of seventy, to see what the settlement needed, and he reported: “Everything.” At one point a group of religious lepers had actually started a church, and leafing through their treasured Bible had come upon that glowing passage of hope in which the Apostle John reported: “And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: . . . He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. ... He … washed, and came seeing.” The lepers called their church—it had no building, for Honolulu could spare no lumber—Siloama, and it kept their hope alive, for every leper was convinced that somewhere in the world there must be a pool of Siloam, or a medicine, or an unguent that would cure him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Because Nyuk Tsin was pregnant, she escaped the attentions of Big Saul and his ruthless gang, but as her birth time approached she forgot him and suffered apprehensions of a different nature. For one thing, the lack of water troubled her, and she wondered what her husband would do when the baby came, for he had only one small receptacle for water and no fire at which to heat it. Mun Ki promised: “I’ll ask some of the Hawaiian women to help, and they’ll have buckets.” But Big Saul would permit no one to go near the Chinese shed, and on the final day Nyuk Tsin gave birth to her fifth son under conditions that would not have been permitted had she been an animal: no water, no clean clothes waiting for the child, no food to speed the mother’s milk, no bed for the infant except the cold ground; there was not even clean straw upon which the mother could lie. Nevertheless, she produced a ruddy-faced, slant-eyed little fellow; and then her great worries began.</p>

  <p class="normal">No one knew at that time how the contagion of leprosy operated, for it was a fact that many kokuas like Nyuk Tsin lived in the lazaretto for years in the most intimate contact with lepers without ever acquiring the mai Pake, so mere contact could not be the explanation; but she had learned that if children below the age of eight stayed very long in contact with leprosy, they were sure to catch it; so she nursed her infant as best she could and prayed for the arrival of the next Kilauea. While she waited, she did many things to make her son prematurely strong. She exposed him daily to the winds so that he would know them; she fed him constantly to build health; she slapped him vigorously to make him resist shock; but at night she cuddled him warmly between her sallow breasts, and she loved him desperately.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Kilauea finally arrived, she was filled with excitement and a determination to act carefully. Therefore, as soon as the first longboat arrived with its cargo of lepers she went down to the landing and called to one of the rowers, “My baby is to go back on your ship,” and she made as if to enter the longboat with the child, but the sailors of the Kilauea were perilously afraid that some day the Kalawao lepers might try to capture their ship and escape, and Nyuk Tsin’s motion seemed as if it could be the beginning of such an attempt, so the sailor swiftly knocked her down with an oar and shouted to his mates, “Push off! Push off!” But when they were safely at sea, Nyuk Tsin, protecting her son, struggled back to her feet and called again, “It is my baby who is to go back on your ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll ask the captain,” shouted back one of the sailors, and on the next trip he yelled, “Where’s the Pake with the baby?” and Nyuk Tsin almost stumbled she ran so fast to give her reply, but she was near tears when the sailor shoved the baby back and said, “Captain wants to know where the baby goes.” Nyuk Tsin eagerly explained: “He goes to Dr. Whipple, in the big house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Doc Whipple died last month,” the sailor growled, and prepared to shove off.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was staggered by this news and sought frantically for an alternative. “Give the baby to Kimo and Apikela, the maile gatherers,” she cried eagerly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where in hell’s that?” the sailor asked, and they rowed back to the ship. On the next trip they advised the agonized Chinese woman that they thought they’d better not take the child, because they had no idea what to do with it when they got to Honolulu, and since there was no wet nurse aboard on this trip, the baby would have no food for a full day. Nyuk Tsin tried to explain that the captain could give the child to any Chinese, and as for food, she had made little bags filled with poi which he could suck. But the longboat pulled away, and in complete panic Nyuk Tsin saw the Kilauea prepare to steam off, so without knowing what she was attempting she walked out into the surf, with her child in her arms, and she started vainly to attempt swimming to the departing ship, but as soon as she was in the water the fine Hawaiian swimmer who had shared the leper cage with Mun Ki saw her plight, and leaped in beside her, grasped the infant in his left arm and started swimming strongly toward the ship. The captain saw him coming and halted the engine for a moment until the powerful brown man caught hold of a rope and with a heave pulled himself up and threw the child into the arms of a waiting sailor. Then, with the same movement, he dropped back into the sea and started a long, easy stroke which carried him back to the leper settlement. The Kilauea sounded its whistle. The white goats sprang higher up the cliff sides. And Nyuk Tsin stood with her husband Mun Ki as their son Australia vanished; but all who stood with them watching the ship go, knew that no matter where the child was taken, or to whom, it was better off than it would have been on Kalawao.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THE SEVENTH MONTH</span> of their stay on Kalawao, the depredations of Big Saul and his cronies finally threatened the Chinese, because Nyuk’ Tsin was recovered from her pregnancy. Therefore, the men began to study her, saying among themselves, “A man could have a good time with her, and she’s not diseased at all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Accordingly, three of them swooped down one night on the grassy shack and grabbed for Nyuk Tsin. But she and her husband had long ago prepared themselves for this event, and the invaders were met by two fighting Chinese armed with sharply pointed sticks. It was a bitter, silent fight, with doomed Mun Ki rising from his bed of leaves to battle desperately with Big Saul, while Nyuk Tsin, with pointed sticks in her hands, slashed and jabbed at the other two.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once she was caught around the waist by arms that had only fragmentary hands, and she could smell the foul breath of a leper dragging her to him, but she jabbed backward with her sticks, and he screamed with pain and released her. Now there were two Chinese against two invaders, and like a jungle animal she instinctively ignored her own assailant and sprang for the jugular of Big Saul, the leader, and with great force she jabbed her remaining stick at the side of his head and it must have struck either his ear and gone in there or the soft part of his temple, for it pressed inward . . . long and sharp and pleasingly. At the same time Mun Ki ripped upward with his sharp stick, and Big Saul gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">Clutching his two vital wounds, he staggered away into the night and began shouting, “The Pakes have killed me!” This diverted his unwounded helper, who ran to assist his chief while the third man stumbled in the darkness with three inches of stick protruding from his left eye.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Pakes have killed me!” Big Saul bellowed, and he awakened all the community, so that by the time he actually did stagger mortally wounded into a circle of torches, all who could walk were present to witness his gasping, clutching death. Silently they withdrew from the ugly corpse. There were few who had not suffered at the hands of Big Saul, and now that they saw his leprosy-riddled body in the dust, they were content to leave him. His blinded crony slipped away into the night, and silence fell upon the lepers of Kalawao.</p>

  <p class="normal">For the two Chinese it was a dreadful night. They could not know that the community at large approved the death of Big Saul and the blinding of his bully companion. They could not know, huddling alone together in the dark night, that no one in Kalawao was ignorant of how the huge man had met his death: “He went to rape the Pake girl, and her husband killed him. Good for the Pake.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward morning it began to rain, and the mournful drops, falling upon the leafy roof and creeping across the floor, first in tiny traces and finally in a small river, added to the misery, and Nyuk Tsin whispered to her shivering companion, “We did the right thing, Wu Chow’s Father. The others should have done this years ago.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have we any sticks left?” Mun Ki asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I lost both of mine,” his wife confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have one left, and there’s another hidden under the leaves. I think that when they come to seize us in the morning, we should fight until we are dead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think so, too,” Nyuk Tsin replied, and she went to the corner of the miserable hut and from the muddy earth picked up the other weapon. In the lonely silence, not knowing when Big Saul’s men would re-attack, they waited, and Nyuk Tsin said, “I am glad, Wu Chow’s Father, that I came with you. I am humbly honored that tonight you fought to help me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have forgotten that you are a Hakka,” he replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">The rain increased, and for a moment the couple thought they heard the noise of lepers assembling to attack them, but it was only the rustle of water down the sides of the cliff, so Nyuk Tsin asked, “Do you forgive me for my ungainly feet?” And her husband replied, “I don’t see them any more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They huddled together in the cold, dark night and Mun Ki said, “You must promise, Wu Chow’s Auntie, that if you ever escape from here, you will be sure to send my real wife in China as much money as possible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I promise,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you must enter my boys’ names in the village hall.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will do so.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And when you send the news to the hall, you don’t have to mention that you are a Hakka. It would embarrass my wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will not say anything to the letter-writer,” Nyuk Tsin promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you must promise to bury me on the side of a hill.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I shall, just as if we were in China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you must promise to bring my sons to honor my grave.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I shall do so,” Nyuk Tsin agreed, and Mun Ki said, “When dawn comes we will die, Wu Chow’s Auntie, and the promises you have made mean nothing, but I feel better.” Through the long, rainy night they waited and when the gray, cold dawn arrived, Mun Ki the gambler said, “Let’s wait for them no longer. Let’s march out to meet them.” And the two Chinese left the foul grass lean-to, each with a jagged, sharp piece of wood in his right hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was with horror that they saw, slumped in the rain-filled path, the dead body of Big Saul, for they knew that this doomed them to retaliation from the others of the gang, but as they cautiously approached the village, their sticks ready for the final fight, they saw with amazement that the Hawaiian lepers did not draw back in enmity, but moved forward in conciliation, and slowly the deadly sticks were lowered and at last the two Chinese stood surrounded by dying men and women who said, “You did a good thing.” And one woman who had been sadly abused by Big Saul and his gang, but who had stubbornly refused to go insane, said quietly, “We are determined that Kalawao shall be a place of law.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The resurrection of this dreadful lazaretto, where for six years condemned human beings had been thrown upon the beach to die without a single incident of assistance from the society that had rejected them, dated from that morning when the determined woman whose spirit had not been broken by leprosy, or rape, or indignities such as few have known said solemnly, “Kalawao shall be a place of law.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A rude organization was evolved, consisting of people responsible for parceling out the food, a team to bring water into the village, and informal policemen who were to stop the aimless rape of unprotected women. Girls who arrived on the beach unattached were ordered to pick a man quickly, and to stay with him; and when a young wife argued: “But I am married, and I love my husband,” older women told her sternly, “You have left the world. You are in a waiting station for hell. Pick a man. We warn you.” So some women passed in turn from one dying man to another, but in an orderly fashion and not according to the rule of rape.</p>

  <p class="normal">Children, banished without their parents, were given to kokuas who took them as their own, and fed them. And one law was paramount: when an old man or an old woman was clearly about to die, he must no longer be left in the open fields; he must have some kind of shelter.</p>

  <p class="normal">Even when the settlement thus disciplined itself, the government in Honolulu gave little help. Lepers were still thrown upon the beaches to die, and there was no medicine, no lumber, no consolation. But in mid-1871 a Hawaiian who had read many books arrived in the lazaretto, and he launched a more formal government, one of whose first decisions was that the two Chinese must no longer be banished to the foot of the cliff but must be allowed to live among the others. This decision was applauded among the lepers, since it was generally agreed that the coming of limited humanity to Kalawao dated from the night when Mun Ki decided to protect his wife from the rapists, or die. A rude hospital was started, with no doctors but with leper nurses; and women who could read opened a school for children born in the lazaretto. A committee begged the government to send regular supplies of food—five pounds of fresh meat a week for each inmate plus twenty pounds of vegetables or poi—and sometimes it arrived. Gardens were started and a water supply, and the women insisted: “Kalawao shall be a place of law.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There were, of course, still no organized houses in the leper settlement, and over half the afflicted people slept year after year under bushes, with no bedding and only one change of clothing. These naturally died sooner than even the ravages of leprosy would have dictated, and perhaps this was a blessing, but even the most horrible crawling corpses somehow longed for homes of their own, a shack with a grass roof where they could preserve the illusion that they were still human beings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, in June, 1871, Nyuk Tsin, after five weeks of living inside the community, but on the bare ground, decided: “Wu Chow’s Father, we are going to build ourselves a house!” Her shattered husband had already begun to lose his toes and fingers and could not be of much help, but she made believe that it was he who was doing the work, and to keep his interest focused on the future, she discussed each step of the building with him. Daily she trudged, to a ruined Hawaiian house built a century before and hauled back heavy stones, standing with them in her arms while he decided exactly where they should be placed. In time a wall was built, and the two shivering Chinese had at least some protection from the winds that howled across Kalawao in the stormy season.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next she sought the ridgepole and the few crossbeams that were essential for the roof, but this was a difficult task, for the government in Honolulu had consistently forgotten to ship the lepers expensive lumber, which had to be imported all the way from Oregon; for although the leaders of the state were practicing Christians and although their consciences bled for the lepers, they instinctively thought: “Those with mai Pake will soon be dead. Why, really, should we waste money on them?” So to get her precious timbers Nyuk Tsin stationed her husband along the shore, where he prayed both for the arrival of driftwood and for the speed to grab it before someone else did. Once he hobbled proudly home with a long piece of timber, and the ridgepole of the roof was slung into place. Now, when the two Chinese lay in their house abuilding, they could look up through the storm and see that promising ridgepole and think: “Soon the rains will be -kept away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">While her husband guarded the shore, Nyuk Tsin taught herself to climb the lower cliffs that hemmed in the leper peninsula, and after a while she became as agile as a goat, leaping from one rock to another in search of small trees that could be used as crossbeams; but goats had roamed these cliffs so long that few trees survived where once forests had stood; but wherever the agile Chinese woman spotted a fugitive she climbed for it, as if she were racing the goats for treasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">These were days of alternate exhilaration and despair. It was good to see Mun Ki taking an active interest in life, such as it was, and Nyuk Tsin often felt a surge of personal pride when she uprooted a tree high on the cliffs; but in the afternoons when the couple gathered pili grass and braided the panels for their future roof, exasperation would overcome them, and Mun Ki often cried, “We have the grass panels finished but nowhere can we find the crossbeams on which to tie them.” Those were the days when the missionary advisers to the king, in Honolulu, argued: “We must not waste money on Kalawao.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One day a whole board, long enough if carefully split to provide crossbeams for an entire roof, washed ashore from some distant wreck, and for a moment Mun Ki thought that he had secured it for himself, but a big man named Palani, whose feet were still sound, rushed down and captured it. So the Chinese continued to sleep under the open roof, with the rain upon them night after night; but they were luckier than many, and they knew it, for they had side walls to protect them from the wind; they had the solid ridgepole of their roof; and they had the pili-grass panels finished and waiting to be slung into position.</p>

  <p class="normal">More, they had a rude kind of spiritual peace. Mun Ki, sitting on the rocks by the sea, waiting for driftwood, often looked toward the cliff where his sure-footed wife risked her life daily in search of timber, and a change came over him. He was not aware of it, but Nyuk Tsin began to sense that her husband no longer felt inwardly ashamed of her Hakka strength. Once he had even gone so far as to admit grudgingly, “I watched you climbing on the high rocks. I would be afraid to climb there.” This gave her much consolation, but the spiritual repose derived principally from another development. As long as the two Chinese had been total outcasts, even among the lepers, there had been a kind of enforced loyalty between them, for if either fought with the other, there was truly no hope left, so they were bound together by bonds of ultimate despair. But now that they were accepted into the full community, and were recognized for the prudent, loyal people they were, they were proved to be ordinary people, husband and wife, and they could argue about how the house should be built, and sometimes Mun Ki, his patience strained by his stubborn Hakka wife, would stomp off in anger, hobbling on his toeless feet to the beach, where he would sit with dying Hawaiian men and confess to them: “No man can understand a woman,” and the suffering men would recount their defeats at the hands of women. Then, when the day was done, he would hobble back to his home and wait for Nyuk Tsin, and when he heard her coming his heart was glad. At one such conciliation he confessed: “If you were not my kokua, I should be dead by now,” and with no pride of either Punti or Hakka he looked at her in the tropical dusk and said, “Dr. Whipple was right. Wherever a man goes he finds a challenge. Today the committee asked me to handle the distribution of food, because they know I am an honest man. In fact,” he admitted proudly, “I am also on the committee itself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They suffered one major worry: what had happened to their baby? In questioning the sailors from the Kilauea they discovered nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Someone vaguely remembered that the child had been handed to a man on the dock at Honolulu, a Chinese perhaps, but he was not sure. With Dr. Whipple dead there was no way for Nyuk Tsin to send an orderly inquiry, so the two Chinese spent some months of quiet anxiety, which was heightened when an incoming leper said, “I know Kimo and Apikela. They gather maile, but they have only four Pake children.” The parents fretted, but Nyuk Tsin often repeated: “Wherever the boy is, he’s better off than here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki found escape from his worry through a fortunate discovery. One day while keeping guard at the beach, hoping for another timber, he happened to notice that some of the small black volcanic pebbles that lined the shore resembled the beans used in the game of fan-tan, and he started to gather them, and when he had well over a hundred of matched size he spent a long time searching for a completely flat rock, and although he did not find one, he did stumble across a slab which could be made reasonably smooth by polishing with another stone held flat against the surface. When it was ready he spread upon it the beanlike pebbles and began picking them up in his damaged hands, slamming them back down on the flat rock, and counting them out in fours. In time he became so skilled in estimating his initial grab that he could guess with fair accuracy whether the residue would be one, two, three or four; and after he had done this for some days he called to some Hawaiians and showed them the game. For the first two days he merely tested his wits against theirs, and it was one of the Hawaiians who suggested, “We could play a game with those pebbles,” and Mun Ki replied casually, “Do you think so?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Since no one had any money, they looked along the beach to find something they could use as counters, and they came upon some hard yellow seeds dropped by a bush that grew inland, and it was obvious that these would make good substitutes for coins, and in this way the historic fan-tan game of the lepers at Kalawao began. When Mun Ki was banker it was uncanny how, using his two stumps of hands, he could grab a number of pebbles, apparently at random, and estimate whether the total was even or odd; and when bets were placed he was able to hide one of the pebbles, catching it between the base of his thumb and the heel of his damaged hand. If most of his adversaries had their yellow buttons on even, he would drop the hidden pebble, make the residue come out odd, and pocket the profits; but if the bets were concentrated on the odd, he would retain the palmed counter and win again.</p>

  <p class="normal">The game continued for weeks, and more than a dozen men became so excited about it that as soon as the sun was up, they hurried to the beach where the sharp-eyed Pake gambler was willing to stand off their challenges. They played for nothing, only yellow seeds, but they developed agonies of hope over large bets, and in time one of their number, the big excitable man named Palani, the Biblical Paul, began to accumulate most of the buttons.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Mun Ki saw this he was pleased, and on the day when Palani finally cornered the seed-wealth of the lepers his Chinese adversary reported to Nyuk Tsin: “Palani is getting caught, just as we planned. Pray for me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the following days Palani began to lose. If he bet on evens, Mun Ki would drop the hidden pebble in his palm and throw down an odd number, and whenever the Hawaiian decided to risk a lot of seeds and go for a big win on a specific number, say three, it was a simple matter for Mun Ki to make the pebbles come out even, so that they couldn’t possibly yield a three. The residue might be two or four, but never three.</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly Palani’s pile diminished, but Mun Ki knew from the past that the cultivation of a sucker demanded patience and skill, so on some days Palani triumphed; but over the long haul he lost, and the afternoon came when Mun Ki ruthlessly drove him down to a mere handful of seeds. Excitement among the lepers was great as the fan-tan game progressed, and many were standing about when the Chinese finally broke his adversary completely, whereupon the Hawaiian spectators started joshing the loser, which was what Mun Ki wanted. When the joking was at its height, the Chinese said casually, “Palani, why don’t we play this way. You have the ridgepole for your house, and I have one for mine. It’s ridiculous for neither of us to have a complete roof, so I’ll play for your ridgepole against mine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an excited hush about the flat rock, and Mun Ki prayed that the Hawaiian would rise to the challenge, but when the big man did so he added a stipulation which left the Chinese stunned. To begin with, Palani said simply, “All right, I’ll play for the timber . . . tomorrow,” and Mun Ki tried to mask his joy, but then the big man added, “And tomorrow we won’t pick up pebbles by hand. We’ll scoop them up in a cup. And you won’t count them, Mun Ki. Keoki over there will count them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you trust me?” Mun Ki pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">The big Hawaiian stared at the little gambler and said, “We’ll scoop them up in a cup.” And he marched off with his friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mun Ki sat alone for a long time glumly staring at the pebbles on the fan-tan rock. Carefully he recapitulated each incident in his relationship with Palani: “It all goes back to that day when I saw the big timber first. But he had good feet, so he dashed out and got it for himself. I must have shown my temper. So all along he’s known what I’ve been planning. Letting him win and then making him lose. That evil man! All the time I was teasing him, he was really playing with me, letting me make him win and then letting me make him lose. So that while I thought I was trapping him into gambling for his roof, he was trapping me into gambling for mine. These damned Hawaiians.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Distraught, he hobbled home, looked up at his precious ridgepole and threw himself upon his wife’s mercy. “Tomorrow we may lose our roof,” he said solemnly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have no roof . . . yet,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have the ridgepole,” Mun Ki replied glumly. “And we’re going to lose it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our ridgepole?” his wife shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nyuk Tsin, be quiet,” he pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What have you been doing?” she shouted again, pushing him against the wall. “Did you gamble away our timber?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We still have a chance,” he assured her, and then he explained how while he was leading big dumb Palani into a trap, the wily Hawaiian had really been leading him into one.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, husband!” Nyuk Tsin cried, and she began to weep, but he comforted her, and all night the two Chinese tried to figure out what their chances were, now that Palani had insisted that they play the game honestly.</p>

  <p class="normal">As dawn broke, the sleepless Mun Ki was figuring with a stick in the wet sand and suddenly he looked up toward his wife with a beatific smile upon his thick, leprous lips. “Our good luck is beginning today,” he assured her, and his sweating over the ridgepole ceased. “Three years ago we started the taro patch, and that was the beginning of our bad luck. We lost our money, got sick, were tricked by the Chinese doctor, and had to leave home. But the three years are over. Now our good-luck cycle is beginning, Nyuk Tsin!” he cried triumphantly. “We have six years of good luck ahead of us. Today I’ll win Palani’s ridgepole and tonight we’ll sleep under our own roof!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In an ecstasy of hope he led Nyuk Tsin down to the fan-tan rock, where Palani and his Hawaiians were waiting. The pebbles were on the flat surface, and beside them stood a metal cup with a handle. After some discussion it was agreed that the game should be played in this way: Palani would scoop a cupful of pebbles, and the umpire Keoki, closely watched by Nyuk Tsin, would count them out in fours until the residue was known. Mun Ki, in the meantime, would bet on odd or even and would also stipulate a specific number. Thus, if he nominated even and four, and if the pebbles left a residue of four, he would win two points for his even guess and four points for having guessed the exact number. On the other hand, if he wished to hedge his bets, he could nominate even and three, which would still yield him four points if three came up. Then he would scoop up the pebbles, and Palani would name his bets, and the first man to win one hundred points would win the other’s roof.</p>

  <p class="normal">Palani, content that he now had the Chinese in an honest game, was satisfied that he would win, but Mun Ki, joyous in the start of his six-year cycle of good luck, was positive that he would triumph. He watched the big Hawaiian scoop the pebbles, hold them aloft, and wait for his guess. “Odd and three,” Mun Ki cried, and the pebbles were deposited before the umpire. Eagerly the circle of faces closed in for the count.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a ghoulish crowd that watched the battle for the ridgepoles. Some men had no hands and some lacked feet. The lips of some had fallen away and there were many noses missing. From the group arose the unmistakable stench of the leper, and brown skins were often marked with huge sickly-white areas. Hair had fallen out and sometimes eyes. These were the caricatures of men, those cursed by a malevolent nature so remorseless that few in the world who were not lepers could imagine. These fan-tan players were indeed the walking corpses, the crawling souls so foul that sound men, seeing them, could only shudder. They were the dead, the bodies thrown onto the beach at Kalawao, the forgotten, the abominated.</p>

  <p class="normal">But now in the bright sunlight they laughed merrily, and if the judge had inadequate fingers with which to count in fours, he was allowed to keep his job because he was known as a trustworthy man. “Odd and one, he cried. “Two points to the Pake.” The crowd cheered.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it came time for Mun Ki to scoop up the pebbles a difficulty presented itself. Although he had been able to play the game with his stumps, he did not have enough fingers to grasp the handle of the cup, so after two trial attempts he appealed to the crowd, and his request was granted: he passed the cup to Nyuk Tsin, and she scooped the pebbles. “Odd and three,” Palani cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the judge had counted, he announced: “Even.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s our lucky year!” Mun Ki shouted joyfully, and then he stopped to explain how a Chinese has three bad years followed by six good ones. “The good ones started last night!” he chuckled, and on Palani’s next scoop he scored six points, for he bet on even and two, and that’s how the pebbles fell.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the midway mark Mun Ki was leading by a score of fifty to thirty-nine, and it was indeed uncanny how he picked up points. “It’s our lucky year!” he exulted, and as the sun grew hot it became apparent that Palani was bound to lose his roof. Nevertheless, he played his numbers stolidly to the end, and when the Chinese gambler had fairly won, one hundred to eighty-three, the big Hawaiian jumped up, stretched and said, “I myself will carry the timber to your house!” And the Hawaiians formed a procession, those who could walk, and when they got Palani’s driftwood to the stone walls which Nyuk Tsin had built, they cut it into lengths for crossbeams, and men who were agile leaped onto the top of the walls, lashed the beams in place and began tying down the pili grass that others passed to them. By midafternoon the roof was done, and Mun Ki, appraising it proudly, explained to all: “This is really my lucky year.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Nyuk Tsin saw the disappointment in big Palani’s misshapen face, and without consulting her husband she went to the man and said, “In our new house there is room for another,” and she took Palani by the hand end led him inside. The crowd cheered her generosity and then watched Mun Ki to see what he would do, but he cried, “This is the beginning of my six lucky years.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Taking the dying man Palani into their home was one of the best things Nyuk Tsin ever did, for he had been a sailor and he was a great liar; during a storm he would sit in the dark hut and tell the Pakes of distant lands, and it seemed wonderful to Nyuk Tsin that one man could have had so many experiences. “Asia, Africa, America!” he cried. “They’re all fine lands to see.” And as he talked, Mun Ki and his wife began to visualize the distant continents and to appreciate what a surpassing treasure their sons were going to inherit. One night Mun Ki said, “When you go back to the boys, Wu Chow’s Auntie, make them learn to read. They should know about the things that Palani has been telling us.” Once he actually said, “I am glad I came to the Fragrant Tree Country. A man should have great adventures.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Palani’s fo’c’s’l yarns also awakened Nyuk Tsin’s imagination, and she saw how much better it was to live closely with her neighbors rather than apart as she had had to do as a Hakka wife, and sometimes at night, when rain fell over their roof, the three strange companions found a positive joy in sitting together, and this was the beginning of Nyuk Tsin’s remarkable service to Kalawao. When big Palani died she helped bury him and then brought into her roofed house a man and wife, and when they died she buried them. She became known as the “Pake Kokua,” and whenever a new ferryload of lepers was dumped ashore on the terrible and inhospitable beaches of Kalawao, she went among them and showed them how to obtain at least some comfort during the first weeks when they had to sleep in the open. She taught them to build houses, as ‘ she had done, and day after day she climbed the cliffs seeking out short timbers for others. Her most particular contribution was this: when the ferry threw ashore some young girl she would keep the girl in her house for a week or so, and there the girl was safe, as if she had come upon one of the ancient and holy sanctuaries maintained by the Hawaiians before the white man came, and during these days of grace Nyuk Tsin would bring to the girl a chain of possible husbands and would say sternly, “You have come here to. die, Liliha. Do so in dignity.” And many marriages, if they could be called such, were both arranged and consummated in Nyuk Tsin’s house, and word seeped back to Honolulu about the Pake Kokua.</p>

  <p class="normal">For his part, Mun Ki reveled in his time of good luck. He kept his fan-tan game running and was delighted one day to find that the leper ferry had brought him a Cantonese man, near death, who had managed to hide out in Iwilei for two years before the quack herbalist turned him in, and who was as good a gambler as he. They would play fan-tan by the hour, with Mun Ki insisting, “Pick up the pebbles in the cup, please.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then the leprosy, which had been accumulating in enormous reserves throughout his body, burst forth horribly in many places and he could not leave the stone house Nyuk Tsin had built for him. She could provide him with no medicine, neither for his awful sores nor for the pneumonia that attacked him. She could get him no choice food . . . just salt beef and poi. There were no blankets to ease the hard earthen bed. But there was Nyuk Tsin’s patient care, and as ghastly days progressed, with death extremely tardy, she sat with her husband and attended to his last instructions.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are obligated to send money to my wife,” he reminded her. “And when the boys are married, send word to the village. Try any ventures you wish, for these are my lucky years.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As death approached, he became unusually gentle, a poor wasted shadow of a man, a ghost, and he told the self-appointed governor of the settlement, “The fan-tan game belongs to you.” At the very end he said to Nyuk Tsin, “I love you. You are my real wife.” And he died.</p>

  <p class="normal">She scratched his grave into the sandy soil, choosing the side of a hill as she had promised, where the winds did not blow and where, if there was no tree, there was at least a ledge of rock upon which his spirit could rest on its journeys from and to the grave.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin now turned her house into a hospital, and no longer were stumps of human beings seen abandoned in open fields. She cared for them until they died, and there were sometimes five or six days in a row when she never saw a whole living person. She cared for those who were beyond the memory of God, and there was no human being so foul in his final disintegration but that she could tend him. In Honolulu the government could find no way to send medicine to the abandoned, nor bandages nor even scalpels to cut away lost members, but Nyuk Tsin devised tricks of her own, and many Hawaiians blessed her as the Pake Kokua. If anyone had asked her: “Pake, why do you work so hard for the Hawaiian lepers?” she would have replied: “Because Kimo and Apikela took me in.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In these days she formed one habit. As each dusk came she sat apart and took off all her clothes. Starting with her face she would feel for signs of leprosy, and then her breasts, and then her flanks. She studied each hand with care and then inspected her legs. Finally she lifted her big feet and looked at each toe in turn, and when she was satisfied that for another day she was free of leprosy, she dressed and went to bed. She had to perform this inspection at dusk, for the government in Honolulu could not find the funds to provide the lepers with lamps and oil, so that when night fell, the utter blackness of hell descended upon the lazaretto, and ugliness rode the night. But Nyuk Tsin, even though she was now an unattached woman, was left alone, and she slept in peace, for she knew that so far she was not leprous.</p>

  <p class="normal">In early 1873 word was sent to Nyuk Tsin that in reward for her help at Kalawao she would be permitted to return to civilization, provided that upon her arrival in Honolulu three doctors would certify that she was free of leprosy. The news excited much discussion among the lepers, but one reaction dominated: although all were sorry to see her go, none begrudged her the right. So in the period between ships this twenty-six-year-old Chinese girl moved about the peninsula of Kalawao. She climbed up to the crater where the volcano which had built the island had once flourished, and she crossed over to the westward side of the peninsula where, in her opinion, the tiny settlement of Kalaupapa offered a much better home for future lepers than the eastern side at Kalawao. But mostly she looked at the towering cliffs that hemmed in the peninsula, and she watched the wild white goats leaping in freedom. To herself she said, “I never expected to leave Kalawao. May those who are left behind find decency.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the day of Nyuk Tsin’s departure from the lazaretto the little Kilauea chugged into position beneath the cliffs; casks and cattle were kicked into the surf; and a longboat came in with its first load of condemned; and although Nyuk Tsin had decided to go out to the ship on the first return trip, she now changed her mind and moved among the quivering newcomers, explaining conditions to them in her broken Hawaiian; and when the last incoming boat arrived, the sailors had to warn her: “Hey, Pake! More better you come, eh?” As she went to the boat she met climbing out of it a small, white-faced man in black priest’s clothing. He wore glasses and his eyes were close together. His hair was combed straight forward like a boy’s; his trip among the cattle had made him dirty, and his fingernails were filthy. Now, as he stepped ashore at Kalawao he was breathing deeply, as if in a trance, and he stared in horror at what he saw. To the self-appointed governor he said in an ashen voice, “I am Father Damien. I have come to serve you. Where is a house in which I may stay?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was so surprised to think that a white man would volunteer to help her lepers that she did not find words to cry, “You may have my house!” By the time she thought of this, the sailors were already pulling her into the longboat, and so she left, but as she went she could see the lepers explaining to the priest that in Kalawao there were no houses and that he, like any other newcomer, would have to sleep as best he could on the bare ground under a hau tree.</p>

  <p class="normal">WHEN NYUK TSIN RETURNED from the lazaretto she was dominated by one desire, to recover her children, and as soon as the Kilauea docked she hurried off, a thin, sparse-haired Chinese widow of twenty-six wearing a blue smock, blue trousers and a conical bamboo hat tied under her chin and reaching out over her closely wound bun in back. She was barefooted, and after an eventful life of eight years in Hawaii, owned exactly what she wore -- not even a toothbrush or a smock more -- plus seven undeveloped acres of boggy land left to her by Dr. Whipple. As she plodded up Nuuanu Valley she did not pause to study the land, but as she went past she did think: “I shall have to start spading it tonight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She was on her way to the forest home of Kimo and Apikela, and when at last she reached the footpath leading off the highway and into the dense vegetation, she broke into a run, and the wind pulled her basket hat backward, so that it hung by the cord around her neck, and at last she burst into the clearing where her children ought to be, but the family was inside the house, and she got almost to the door before Apikela saw her. The big Hawaiian shouted, “Pake! Pake!” and hurried over to embrace her, lifting her clear off the ground, but even while huge Apikela was holding her, Nyuk Tsin was looking over the woman’s shoulder and counting. There were only four boys, from seven years down to four, standing in the shadows, frightened by this intruder.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where’s the other boy?” Nyuk Tsin finally gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s no other boy,” Apikela replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Didn’t you get the baby from the ship?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We heard of no baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was tormented by the loss of her child, yet overjoyed to see her other sons, and these dual emotions immobilized her for a moment, and she stood apart in the small grass house looking first at big Apikela, then at drowsy Kimo, and finally at her four hesitant sons. Then she forgot the missing child and moved toward her boys, as if to embrace them, but the two youngest naturally drew back because they did not know her, while the two oldest withdrew because they had heard whispers that their mother was a leper. Nyuk Tsin, sensing this latter fear, hesitated, stopped completely and turned to Apikela, saying, “You have cared well for my babies.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was my joy to have them,” the huge Hawaiian woman laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How did you feed them?” Nyuk Tsin asked, feasting her eyes on her robust sons.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You can always feed children,” Kimo assured her. “Sometimes I worked. Sometimes the Pakes gave us a little money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do they have the other child?” Nyuk Tsin asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They never spoke,” Apikela replied. Then the big woman noticed how frightened the boys were of their mother, and with a gigantic, embracing sweep of her huge arms she gathered them up as she had often done before. When they were huddled against her warm and ample body, she gave her belly a sudden flick, opened her arms and ejected a tangle of arms and legs at Nyuk Tsin. The scrawny little Chinese woman was engulfed, and then a strange thing happened. It was she who feared the leprosy, and instead of embracing her sons, she withdrew as if she were unclean, and the boys stared silently at their mother while she drew her hands behind her, lest she touch one of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am afraid,” she said humbly, and Apikela withdrew the children.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a noisy meal during which the boys chattered with Kimo, and Apikela asked a dozen aimless questions about Kalawao, Nyuk Tsin said, “I must go down to look at my land,” and she set off for the four-mile jog back down the valley to where the boggy land lay, but again she passed it without stopping, for she was on her way to see the Punti and Hakka families, but none of them knew of her son. Because they were Carthaginian families, they felt obligated to help Mun Ki’s widow, so they scraped together a set of garden tools, some seeds, a bag of taro corms and a bamboo carrying-pole with two baskets attached. With these Nyuk Tsin returned to her land, and there she worked till nearly midnight.</p>

  <p class="normal">The low and boggy section she enclosed in dikes, for there taro would prosper. Furthermore, building the taro bed also drained the intermediate land, uncovering good alluvial soil, which she tilled for Chinese vegetables. This left a smaller, but still adequate high area where vegetables for the haoles could be grown. Thus, from the first night, Nyuk Tsin stumbled upon the system she was to follow for many years: taro for the Hawaiians, Chinese cabbage and peas for the Orientals, lima beans, string beans and Irish potatoes for the haoles. For she knew they all had to eat.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn each day she slung her bamboo pole across her shoulder, hooked on the two baskets, jammed her conical basket hat upon her head, and set out barefooted for her garden. As her vegetables ripened, she loaded her baskets and began her long treks through Honolulu, and no matter how much business she produced at any one house, she was never as concerned with the money as she was to see whether this family happened to have a Chinese boy about four years old. She didn’t find her son, but she developed a vegetable business that was becoming profitable.</p>

  <p class="normal">When night fell, Nyuk Tsin continued working, putting her field in order, and after the stars had come out she would carefully place in her baskets those vegetables which she had not sold. Swinging them onto her shoulder, she would begin her four-mile trek back up the valley to the clearing where her sons were already asleep. There were many days when she never saw them, but as she sat in the night darkness with Kimo and Apikela she talked mostly of their future, and one night, when she had trudged up the valley in a heavy rain, she arrived home cold and wet and she was driven to recall the days in the lazaretto when the leper Palani told them of the world. So she woke her sons and stood before them, muddy and wet, and they rubbed their heavy eyes, trying to understand what she was saying. They could hardly speak Chinese and she was not adept in Hawaiian, but she explained: “Somewhere in Honolulu you have a brother, and his name . . .” The boys began to fidget, and she commanded them to stand still, but they could not understand.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Eh, you kanaka!” Apikela shouted. “Shush! Your auntie speak you! Damned Pakes!” And the boys stood silent.</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly Wu Chow’s Auntie spoke: “Your father wanted you to share the entire world. He wanted you to study … to be bright boys. He said, ‘Work hard and the world will belong to you.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">She took her first son by the hand and drew him into the middle of the room, saying, “Asia, you must honor your father by working hard.” The sleepy-eyed boy nodded, quite unaware of the commission he had been given.</p>

  <p class="normal">To each of her sons she repeated this paternal command: “Work hard.” And when they stood at attention, she added, “And you must help me find your brother Australia.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is he?” Asia asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” Wu Chow’s Auntie replied, “but we must find him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the confused and sleepy boys returned to bed, the little Chinese woman sat for a long time with the two Hawaiians, trying to decide which of her sons promised to be the most intelligent, and this was important, for Nyuk Tsin realized that she would be able to give only one a full-scale education in America and it was essential that the right one be identified early and concentrated upon. Now she asked Kimo, “Which do you think is best?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I like Europe,” Kimo replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You like him,” Nyuk Tsin agreed, “but who is cleverest?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“America is cleverest,” the big man said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin thought so too, but she checked with Apikela. “Do you think America has courage for a fight?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Africa is the most stubborn fighter,” Apikela replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But which one would you send to the mainland?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“America,” Apikela replied without hesitation.</p>

  <p class="normal">By 1875 Nyuk Tsin had saved nearly twenty-five dollars, and if such a rate of income were to continue, she could obviously afford to educate all of her sons, but she knew that there was heavy obligation upon this money, so when it reached the even twenty-five-dollar mark she bundled it up, took her four sons with her, and marched formally down to the Punti store. “I want you to understand what we are doing,” she said several times, and when she reached the store, she lined the boys up so that even six-year-old America could follow the transaction that was about to occur.</p>

  <p class="normal">In those years the Chinese did not use banks, for there were no Chinese establishments, and what Oriental could trust a white man in the handling of money? Wealth was kept hidden until a responsible accumulation was made, and then it was carried, as on this day, to the Punti store or to the Hakka store, and there, in complete confidence, it was handed over to the storekeeper, who, for three per cent of the total, would manage, by ways only he knew, to transmit the balance either to the Low Village, as in the present case, or to the High Village if the recipient were to be a Hakka. Wars came and revolutions. Hawaii prospered or suffered loss. Men died and ships were captured by pirates, but money sent from the Punti store in Honolulu invariably reached the Low Village.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This money is for the wife of Kee Mun Ki,” Nyuk Tsin explained to the storekeeper. When he nodded she said, “A widow in the Low Village. Tell her that as dutiful sons her four boys send the money. And they send as well their filial respect.” Again the storekeeper nodded and began to write the letter.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it was completed, in strange Chinese characters that few in Hawaii could read, Nyuk Tsin proudly handed it to each of the boys and said, “You are sending money to your mother. As long as she lives you must do this. It is the respect you owe her.” Gravely the little pigtailed boys in clean suits handled the letter, and each, in his imperfect way, could visualize China, with his mother sitting in a red robe and opening the letter and finding his money inside. When the letter was handed back to the storekeeper for transmitting, Nyuk Tsin stood her boys in line and said, “Remember! As long as your mother lives, this is your duty.” And the boys understood. Big Apikela was like a mother in that she sang to them and kissed them; and Wu Chow’s Auntie was sometimes like a mother because she brought them food; but their real mother, the one that counted, was in China.</p>

  <p class="normal">Since the day on which the money was taken to the Punti store was already ruined, Nyuk Tsin decided to explore something that she had heard of with great excitement. She led her four bright-faced boys back up Nuuanu Valley, taking them off into a smaller valley where in a field a large building stood. It belonged to the Church of England, for as soon as the Hawaiian alii discovered the gentle and pliant religion of Episcopalianism with its lovely ceremonies, they contrasted it to the bleak, un-Hawaiian Calvinism of the Congregationalists, and before long most of the alii were Church of England converts. They loved the rich singing, the incense and the robes. One of the first things the English missionaries did was to open the school which Nyuk Tsin now approached, and to the surprise of the islands the Englishmen announced: “In our school we will welcome Chinese boys.” The idea of having Orientals in any large numbers in the big, important school at Punahou would in 1875 have been repugnant, and also prohibitively expensive to the Chinese, so the ablest flocked to Iolani, where Nyuk Tsin now brought her sons.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was met by one of the most unlikely men ever to inhabit Hawaii, Uliassutai Karakoram Blake, a tall, reedy Englishman with fierce mustaches and a completely bald head, even though he was only twenty-eight. His adventurous Shropshire parents had been with a camel caravan heading across Outer Mongolia from the town of his first name to the town of his second when he was prematurely born, “jolted loose ere my time,” he liked to explain, “by the rumbling motion of a camel which practically destroyed my sainted mother’s pelvic structure.” He had grown up speaking Chinese, Russian, Mongolian, French, German and English. He was now also a master of pidgin, a terrifying disciplinarian and a man who loved children. He had long ago learned not to try his Chinese on the Orientals living in Hawaii, for they spoke only Cantonese and Punti, and to him these were alien languages, but when Nyuk Tsin spoke to him in Hakka, it sounded enough like Mandarin for him to respond, and he immediately took a liking to her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So you want to enroll these four budding Lao-tses in our school?” he remarked in expansive Mandarin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are not Lao-tses,” she corrected. “They’re Mun Ki’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Uliassutai Karakoram Blake, and he demanded of his acquaintances his full name, looked down severely at Nyuk Tsin and asked, “Is there any money at all in the coffers of Mun Ki, y-clept Kee?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s dead,” she replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Blake swallowed. He liked this practical woman, but nevertheless he tried to smother her with yet a third barrage of words: “Have you any reason to believe that these four orphaned sons of Mun Ki have even the remotest capacity to learn?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin thought a moment and replied, “America can learn. The others aren’t too bright.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Madam,” Uliassutai Karakoram cried with a low bow that brought his mustaches almost to the floor, “in my three years at Iolani you are the first mother who has even come close to assessing her children as I do. Frankly, your sons don’t look too bright, but with humble heart I welcome Asia, Europe, Africa and America into our school.” Very formally he shook the hand of each child, then roared in pidgin, “Mo bettah you lissen me, I knock you plenty, b’lee me.” And the boys did believe.</p>

  <p class="normal">In later years, when Hawaii was civilized and lived by formal accreditations, no teacher who drifted off a whaling boat one afternoon, his head shaved bald, no credentials, with mustaches that reached out four inches, and with a name like Uliassutai Karakoram Blake could have been accepted in the schools. But in 1872, when this outlandish man did just that, Iolani needed teachers, and in Blake they found a man who was to leave on the islands an indelible imprint. When the bishop first stared at the frightening-looking young man and asked, “What are your credentials for teaching?” Blake replied, “Sir, I was bred on camel’s milk,” and the answer was so ridiculous that he was employed. If Blake had been employed in a first-rate school like Punahou, then one of the finest west of Illinois, it wouldn’t have mattered whether he was capable or not, for after Punahou his scholars would go on to Yale, and oversights could be corrected. Or if the teachers in the school were inadequate, the parents at home were capable of repairing omissions. But at Iolani the students either got an education from the available teachers, or they got none at all, and it was Blake’s unique contribution to Hawaii that with his fierce mustaches and his outrageous insistence upon the niceties of English manners, he educated the Chinese. He made them speak a polished English, cursing them in pidgin when they didn’t. He converted them to the Church of England, while he himself remained a Buddhist. He taught them to sail boats in the harbor, contending that no man could be a gentleman who did not own a horse and a boat. Above all, he treated them as if they were not Chinese; he acted as if they were entitled to run banks, or to be elected to the legislature, or to own land. In these years there were many in Hawaii who looked apprehensively into the future and were frightened by what they saw. They did not want Chinese going to college or owning big companies. They were sincerely afraid of Oriental businessmen and intellectuals. They hoped, falsely as it proved, that the Chinese would be perpetually content to work on the plantations without acquiring any higher aspirations, and when they saw their dream proving false, and the Chinese entering all aspects of public life, they sometimes grew panicky and talked of passing ridiculous laws, or of exiling all Chinese, or of preventing them from entering certain occupations. What these frightened men should have done was much simpler: they should have shot Uliassutai Karakoram Blake.</p>

  <p class="normal">For when the first Chinese plantation worker saved, through bitter labor, the few pennies needed to send his son to Iolani, a kind of revolution was launched which nothing in world history had so far proved capable of reversing. When Blake taught the first Chinese boy the alphabet, the old system of indentured labor was doomed. Because a boy who could read would sooner or later come upon some book that would give him an idea, and a boy with an idea could accomplish almost anything. During these years in Hawaii, the Chinese were not particularly well treated. Hell-raising lunas on the plantations—gang foremen—often thought it hilarious to tie two Chinese together by their pigtails and abuse them both at the same time. Other lunas, on a drunk, found delight in tying the pigtail of a passing Oriental to the tail of a horse, and lashing the horse into a gallop. The Chinese retaliated until it became a standing rule among lunas: “Never go into a field where more than six Chinese are working with cane knives. Never.” And one night an infuriated Chinese, for no reason that anyone ever developed, screamed into the bedroom of the French consul and with a long knife massacred him. These were not easy years, and the Chinese were by no means the docile Orientals that the Honolulu Mail had reported on their arrival. They were apt to be mean, fearfully quick to revenge insults, and positively unwilling to extend their contracts at three dollars a month for fourteen hours of hard work a day. Deep tensions were created, and the Chinese experiment might have failed, except that Uliassutai Karakoram Blake was quietly teaching his boys: “The same virtues that are extolled in China will lead to success in Hawaii. Study, listen to your parents, save your money, align yourselves with honest men.” He also laid great emphasis upon the wisdom of conforming to the mores of the majority. “Cut your pigtails,” he counseled, “and dress like Americans. Join their churches. Forget that you are Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A boy asked, “But if we ought to drop Buddhism, why don’t you?” And Uliassutai replied, “When I leave Hawaii, I shall return to England, where freedoms of all kind are permitted. But you will not leave these islands. You will have to live among Americans, and they despise most freedoms, so conform.” He was a difficult, opinionated man, and he transformed a race.</p>

  <p class="normal">In these days, when Nyuk Tsin came to work in the early morning twilight, she led her four sons with her, and for the hours before school opened, they labored in the field with her. As schooltime approached, she dipped a rag in the muddy water of the taro patch and cleaned her sons, sending them off to their lessons. When day ended, they were back among the vegetables, and after nightfall they all reached home, where big Kimo had a hot supper waiting for them. After a year of this severe regime Kimo, exhausted by the amount of work the Chinese were doing, suggested, “Why don’t we all leave this house and build a little house down the valley? We’ll keep this land for a vegetable field. Then nobody will have to walk so far, and I’ll be close to the poolroom.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin considered this for some time and said, “I don’t like to give up even an inch of the vegetable field for a house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But look!” Kimo argued. “For a little corner of the vegetable field, you’ll get a whole lot of land up here.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If we do that,” Nyuk Tsin countered, “Apikela will have to walk great distances for her maile. And I can walk better than Apikela.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I had in mind,” Kimo explained, “was that Apikela should stop bothering with the maile and help you with the vegetable field down there. That way, the boys can study longer for their school.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The plan was so reasonable that next day Nyuk Tsin invited Kimo to accompany her to the vegetable field, and the huge man explained how little land would be taken off by the house, and he reminded her how much forest land she would be getting in exchange, and on the spur of the moment she said, “Good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They took down the upland house and for several nights slept in the open while the lowland house was building, and after a while the first of the famous Kee houses stood on Nuuanu Street. This one was a ramshackle affair, neither waterproof nor tidy, but it comfortably housed five Chinese and two Hawaiians. In a way, it was also responsible for the good fortune of the Kees, for one day when Nyuk Tsin was trudging up the valley toward her new fields, which because they were so high did not produce as well as the lower, she was stopped by a handsome young man of twenty who was riding in a gig and who called, “You the Pake who has the field in there?” She said that she was, and he reined in his horse, climbed down, and extended his hand. “I’m Whip Hoxworth,” he said, “and I’d like to see your field, if I may.” He tied the horse to a tree and tramped in with her, kicked the soil, rubbed some through his palms, and said, “Pake, I’d like to make a deal with you. I brought back with me from Formosa, nearly lost my head doing it, about a hundred pineapple plants. I’ve tried growing them in low fields, and they don’t work. Seems to me a field at this elevation might be nearer to what they knew in Formosa. Tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give you all the plants that are now living. And if you can make them grow, you can have them. All I want is some of the fruit and some of the seed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can you sell pineapple?” Nyuk Tsin asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip Hoxworth turned and pointed expansively back down the valley, and although trees cut off his view, that did not disturb him. “Every house you can see down there will want to buy your pineapples, Pake. Is it a deal?”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was, and young Whip Hoxworth had made a shrewd guess, for Nyuk Tsin’s upper field was exactly the soil needed for the Formosa pineapple, which was markedly sweeter and in all ways superior to the grubby degenerates that had been introduced into the islands half a century before. Now Nyuk Tsin hiked out of her upper Nuuanu fields day after day, her back loaded with pineapples which she hawked through the city. Her vegetables from the lower field also prospered, but best of all, her four sons were learning their necessary lessons.</p>

  <p class="normal">In only one venture was Nyuk Tsin failing and that was, as before, her taro bed, for not satisfied with selling the brutish bulbs to the natives, and the leaves to anyone who wanted to steam them for vegetables, while keeping the stalks to herself for picking and serving with fried mullet, thus exacting three profits from the accommodating taro, she allowed Kimo and Apikela to talk her into boiling down the roots and converting them once more into poi. This time the procedure worked exactly right, and the resulting poi was a rich, gooey, purplish color that made the mouth of any Hawaiian water when he saw it, and a considerable market developed for this Pake poi, as it was called. But very few Hawaiians were able to buy any, for big Apikela and bigger Kimo worked so hard at cultivating the taro that when mealtime came they were famished, and Nyuk Tsin, gobbling a few handfuls of cold rice with perhaps a bit of pickled taro stalk, sat by aghast at the amounts of poi her two gigantic housemates consumed. Kimo, now weighing nearly three hundred and fifty pounds, would lumber over to the poi buckets, ladle himself out a quart or more and serve Apikela an equal amount. Pecking at half a dozen fish, some cold pork, a baked breadfruit and what was left of a can of Oregon salmon, they would dip two fingers, held scooped like loose fishhooks, into the poi, twirl them around the sticky mass, and swing them deftly to their mouths. With a sweet sucking sound they inhaled the delicious paste, and looked happily at each other as they did so.</p>

  <p class="normal">With dismay, Nyuk Tsin realized that none of her poi was getting onto the market. Yet she did not complain, for these great placid people had adopted her children when she was with the lepers. Even now Nyuk Tsin felt that she could not get along without them, for they tended the boys, did the laundry, brought the gossip home from the poolroom, and took care of the poi. But in prudence Nyuk Tsin felt she had to protect herself, so at last she said to Kimo, “I would like to buy your upper fields.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Buy?” Kimo asked in astonishment. “You can have them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe it’s better if I buy them, properly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re yours,” Apikela insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could we go to the land office and sign the papers?” Nyuk Tsin asked. “And I’ll pay you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Big Apikela lifted her Chinese friend in the air and sat her on her lap, saying, “Kimo and I have no use for the land. We have no children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have the four boys,” Nyuk Tsin corrected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good idea!” Kimo cried. “We’ll give the land to our boys.” So the three of them went down to the land office and registered the sale of the upper fields to the Kee boys, and when the white man asked, through his interpreter, “And what fee changed hands?” the two huge Hawaiians looked confused, and the official explained, “There has to be a recognized fee, or the sale isn’t legal.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin began to say that she had a bagful of dimes and reals and Australian gold pieces saved for her sons’ education and she was willing, but Kimo interrupted, and with a grand gesture said, “We sell this Pake our land in return for all the poi we can eat.” And that was what Nyuk Tsin had been thinking about in the first place, and that was how the deed was registered.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a strange and yet typical Hawaii-like life that Nyuk Tsin now led. Her four sons spoke mainly Hawaiian and English, and she communicated with them only in broken Hawaiian. They were carefully thought to think of the shadowy woman in China as their mother, but they considered Apikela their mamma, just as she thought of them as her sons. Nobody in the household even knew Nyuk Tsin’s name, the Hawaiians always calling her merely the Pake, and her children knowing her as Auntie. In food, language and laughter the establishment was Hawaiian. In school-book learning, business and religion it was American. But in filial obedience and reverence for education it was Chinese.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin’s years fell into an almost sacred routine. On the first of March she went to the land office and paid her taxes on her two properties, and her most valued physical possession became a box in which she kept her receipts. For her they were a kind of citizenship, a proof that she had a right to stay in the Fragrant Tree Country.&#160; ,</p>

  <p class="normal">In September and June she washed her one suit of clothes with special care, dressed her hair with a fresh cloth, and accompanied her four sons to discuss their education with Uliassutai Karakoram Blake, who found delight in talking Chinese with her and who said that her sons were doing well. Her insistence upon this was fanatical, and whenever she talked with Blake she hammered one question: “Which of my four sons has the best mind?” And the big, fierce man would reflect and reply, “America.” She was pleased to know that her brilliant son was doing well in school, for she loved to visualize the day on which he would set out to the mainland for his advanced schooling, to be supported by all the others.</p>

  <p class="normal">In April and October, Nyuk Tsin faithfully trekked down to the Punti store with an appropriate number of dollars and sent them off to Kee Mun Ki’s family in the Low Village. Always she took her four sons with her, even though it meant keeping them out of school, for she impressed them with this: “Even more important than education is filial duty, and you are four brothers who must work extra hard to pay the respect due your father and his family.” She made each of the boys actually finger the money as it was turned over, and each of them touched the resulting letter. “Now you can go back to school,” she said. Sometimes she thought it strange that she should be inculcating these ancient Chinese virtues not in the powerful Hakka language but in a broken Hawaiian pidgin. However, the virtues were self-evident and the boys understood.</p>

  <p class="normal">Such was the year of Nyuk Tsin, the Pake Kokua, the Auntie. For herself she had one blouse, one pair of trousers, no shoes and one basket hat. She had a bamboo carrying-pole, two baskets, a poi factory that made no money, and two parcels of land that would one day be worth more than a million dollars. But the revolution in which this slim-hipped Chinese woman was involved stemmed mainly from the fact that she had four bright boys in Iolani, and when they were ready to move into Honolulu’s economic life, fortified by Uliassutai Blake’s inspired learning and their Auntie’s frugal common sense, there would be little that could stop them.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then one day in 1879, as Nyuk Tsin was leading her sons to the Episcopal church, she saw a Hawaiian family entering with seven children, and one of the boys looked Chinese. She began studying this child and concluded that he must be about eight years old, which would be the age of her missing son. She was not sure that he was Chinese, for he blended perfectly with his Hawaiian brothers and sisters, but when service ended she sent her sons home with thirteen-year-old Asia and quietly followed the Hawaiian family to their residence. She found it to be a large, rambling house on Beretania Street far out Diamond Head way, and the eight-year-old boy seemed fully at home there. She tried to ask a passer-by what the family’s name was but could not make the man understand.</p>

  <p class="normal">She now revised her peddling routes and walked miles out of her way to keep check on the big Hawaiian house, and in time she found that the Chinese boy went to school, seemed normally bright, and was known only by a Hawaiian name. Once she lugged her pineapples onto the veranda of the house itself and tried to engage the mother of the household in conversation, but the latter wanted no pineapples. When she had exhausted all her own ingenuity, she decided to discuss the matter frankly with Apikela, but as she was about to do so, her intuition warned her that the big Hawaiian woman would sympathize with her fellow Hawaiian who now had the child, rather than with its rightful mother Nyuk Tsin; furthermore, she concluded that this was the kind of adventure that would appeal to Kimo, who considered himself not exactly fitted for other kinds of work. Accordingly, she took the big, shirtless man aside and said, “Find out who those people are.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t have to find out,” he replied simply. “That’s Governor Kelolo Kanakoa’s house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Find out where they got the Pake child.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good,” Kimo grunted, and he set off to the poolroom and in a short time reported: “The governor was on the docks one day when a ship came in with a little baby boy, and no one knew what to do with it, so naturally the governor said, ‘I’ll take him,’ and he did.” Kimo shrugged his shoulders as if to say, “Isn’t that simple?” And then he saw what Nyuk Tsin was driving at. “The boy belongs to Kelolo!” he warned. “He fed him. He brought him up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But he’s a Pake,” Nyuk Tsin argued. “He’s mine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” Kimo agreed. “He’s your boy, but he belongs to the governor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Patiently, but with swelling emotion, Nyuk Tsin reasoned: “I did not give the child to the governor. I sent him to you, to keep for me till I got home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what did it matter who got the child?” Kimo reasoned back. “The boy has a home and parents who love him. He has others to play with and enough food. What does it matter?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want him to grow up to be a Chinese,” Nyuk Tsin argued, growing nervous.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t understand,” Kimo said blankly. “When I was young my father always had two or three sailors who had fled their ships, hiding out in our fields up there. Swedish, Americans, Spaniards, it didn’t matter. Sometimes they had babies with my sisters, and where are the babies now? I don’t know, neither do my sisters. And are they Spanish or Hawaiian? Who cares?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin found herself making no headway with Kimo, so against her better judgment she enlarged the debate to include Apikela, and as she suspected, the big Hawaiian woman instinctively sided with the boy’s Hawaiian mother. “You must think of how much the governor’s wife has grown to love this boy,” Apikela reasoned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But she has six children of her own!” Nyuk Tsin replied in growing despair.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They aren’t all her own!” Apikela replied triumphantly. “Some were left in the street and one I know comes from Maui.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to get my son,” Nyuk Tsin said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Pake!” Apikela warned. “He is no longer your son.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin spoke unwisely: “Are the other four boys no longer my sons, either?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Softly Apikela replied, “No, Pake, they are not yours alone. They are now my sons too.” She did not have the words to explain that in the Hawaiian system the filial-parent relationship was completely fluid, and son-ship derived not from blood lines but from love. No child was ever left abandoned, and some of the most touching narratives of Hawaiian history stemmed from the love of some peasant woman who heard the cries of an unwanted girl baby whom the alii had left beside the sea to perish, and the peasant woman had rescued the child and had raised it as her own until war came, or some other great event, and then the child was revealed in full beauty. It had happened again and again. Apikela was unable to explain all these things to her Pake friend, but she did add this: “In all the Hawaiian families you see, there will always be one child that was found somewhere. A friend gave the child to the family, and that was that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Stubbornly Nyuk Tsin repeated her question: “Then my boys are not my sons?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not yours alone,” huge Apikela repeated. The little Chinese woman, steeled in the Hakka tradition of family, stared at her big Hawaiian friend, reared in the softer tradition of love, and each woman typified the wisdom of her race, and neither would surrender, but as always, it was the copious Hawaiian who made the overture of peace: “Surely, Pake, with four boys we have enough for two mothers.” And the big woman was so persuasive that even though Nyuk Tsin despised the concept being offered, and saw in it an explanation of why the Hawaiians were dying out and the Chinese were thriving, she could not ignore the testimony of love that she saw in the happy faces of her sons. Even if they did have to live suspended between Hawaiian love and Chinese duty, they were thriving; so at last Nyuk Tsin allowed herself to be drawn into Apikela’s great arms and cherished, as if she were a daughter and not an equal. Then the big woman said, “Now that our tempers are at peace, let us go see the governor’s wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sedately, she and Kimo and the Pake walked down Nuuanu to Beretania and then out toward Diamond Head, and when they got to the governor’s big house, Apikela said softly, “I will speak,” and as if she were an ambassador from the court of the Nuuanu taro patch to the high court of Beretania Street, she explained to the governor’s wife: “The Pake thinks your seventh child is hers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Probably is,” Governor Kelolo’s wife agreed easily. “I think my husband found him on a boat.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Pake would like to take the boy home with her,” Apikela said softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The governor’s wife looked down at her hands and began to cry. Finally she said gently, “We think of the boy as our own.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“See!” Apikela said, and she withdrew from the interview, for there was obviously nothing more to say.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Nyuk Tsin was just beginning. “I appreciate what you did for the boy. He looks very clean and intelligent. But he is my son, and I would like to . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is very happy here,” the governor’s wife explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is my son,” Nyuk Tsin struggled. She felt as if she were engulfed in a mass of cloud or formless foam. She could push it back, but always it returned to smother her. The three big Hawaiians were falling upon her, strangling her with love.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the governor’s wife was speaking: “But we think of him as our son, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If I went to court, what would the judge say?” Nyuk Tsin threatened.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now both the governor’s wife and Apikela began to weep, and the former said, “There is no need to involve the judges. Apikela said that you had your four sons with you. Why not leave the fifth boy with us? We love him very much.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is my son,” Nyuk Tsin stubbornly argued, but the phrase really had little meaning to the three Hawaiians. Obviously, the attractive boy was a son in many more ways than this thin Chinese woman could understand.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point the governor himself entered, a tall, handsome man in his late forties. He was generous in his attitude toward everyone and listened patiently, first to Apikela, then to his wife, and finally to Nyuk Tsin. When he spoke he said, “Then you are the Pake Kokua?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Every Hawaiian owes a debt to you, Kokua.” He formally extended his hand. Then he remembered: “It was about eight years ago. I was at the docks on some kind of business. I wasn’t governor then, had just come over from Maui. And this ship came in with a sailor who had a screaming baby, and he said, ‘What shall I do with it?’ And I said, Feed it.’ And he said, I got no tits.’ So I took the boy and brought him home.” He paused significantly, then added, “And we made him one of our sons.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now I want him,” Nyuk Tsin said forcefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And it would seem to me,” the governor said, ignoring her, “that it might be a very good thing if this Chinese boy continued to grow up in this house, among the Hawaiians. We two races need to understand each other better.” Then he stopped and said bluntly, “I love the boy as my own son. I don’t think I could let him go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The judge will give him to me,” Nyuk Tsin said coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tears came into the big man’s eyes and he asked, “Have you no other children of your own?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have four,” Nyuk Tsin replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then leave the boy with us. Please don’t speak of judges.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The governor’s wife brought in tea, and Nyuk Tsin was invited to sit in the best brocaded chair, and Kimo asked if they happened to have any poi. The meeting lasted for four patient hours, and the little Chinese woman was positively beat down by love. When her son was summoned she saw that he was big and bright and strong. He was not told that the strange Chinese woman in the smock and trousers was his mother, for he called the governor’s wife that, and after he was dismissed, many proposals were made, and Nyuk Tsin consented to this: her fifth son would continue to live with the governor, but he must be told who his real mother was . . . And here Nyuk Tsin began to get mixed up, because she also insisted that the boy be given the Chinese name Oh Chow, the Continent of Australia, and that twice each year he accompany his brothers to the Punti store when the money was sent to his real mother in China.</p>

  <p class="normal">“His real mother?” the governor asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Nyuk Tsin explained. “His real mother is in China. I am merely his auntie.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought you gave birth to the boy in Kalawao,” the governor checked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I did,” Nyuk Tsin assured him. “But his mother is in China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The governor listened patiently and asked, “Could you please explain this again?” and as Nyuk Tsin repeated the curious rigmarole he realized that he was comprehending very little of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">So Nyuk Tsin took Australia to the Punti store, where his name was duly forwarded to the ancestral hall in the Low Village, while he continued to be known in Hawaii as Keoki Kanakoa, the son of the last governor of Honolulu. He met his brothers, Asia, Europe, Africa and America, and then returned to the big rambling house. He called Nyuk Tsin, whose name he never knew, Auntie, and he vaguely understood that in China he had a real mother, to whom it was his duty to send money twice a year.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was one other thing that Nyuk Tsin insisted upon. Four acres of Governor Kanakoa’s choicest upland in Manoa Valley, then a wet, forested wilderness, were officially deeded over to the boy Australia Kee, otherwise known as Keoki Kanakoa, and after these were cleared, Nyuk Tsin grew pineapples on them. She was now thirty-two years old, and except for a really gaunt thinness and a lack of hair she was what one might call an attractive woman; but even though there was an appalling lack of women for Chinese men-- 246 women; 22,000 men--none of the latter ever considered Nyuk Tsin as a wife. She had proved herself to be a husband-killer and she was probably also a leper.</p>

  <p class="normal">So she lived spiritually apart from her sons and her community. Each night after the others were in bed, she stripped herself naked and with a small lamp inspected each area of her body, and when she had finally cleared even her big feet of suspicion she sighed and said to herself, “Still no leprosy.” And if she avoided this, nothing else mattered.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN WHIPPLE HOXWORTH RETURNED</span> to Hawaii in 1877 he had brought with him only a hundred pineapple plants and a bag of miscellaneous seeds to show for his seven years abroad, but he had already become the man who was destined to rebuild the structure of the islands. He was tall, wiry-thin, quick both in muscle and wit and unusually well trained in the use of his fists. He had the insolent assurance of his paternal grandfather, Captain Rafer Hoxworth, plus the distinguished bearing that had characterized his maternal grandfather, Dr. John Whipple. He also exhibited certain other behavior patterns of those two men.</p>

  <p class="normal">Like Captain Rafer, young Whip had an insatiable desire for women, and following quickly upon the Chinese girl who had taught him lessons at the age of thirteen, he had enjoyed the wild companionship of strange women in most of the world’s major ports. His entire earnings for seven years had been spent freely on these women, and he regretted not a penny of his loss, for he had made an essential discovery: he had it within his power to make women happy. Sometimes at a formal party, when as a budding second mate he was invited to a home of distinction in Perth or Colombo or Bangkok, he would enter the room and physically feel the lines of communication establishing themselves between him and certain women, and as the night wore on he would stare quietly, yet with insolent power, at the most likely of these companions, and he would seek her out for a dance and say certain modest yet fire-filled things to her, and the atmosphere often became so charged with passion that when he had maneuvered to find himself alone with the woman, she would thrust herself into his arms and encourage him to do with her as he wished, even though a few hours before they had not known of each other’s existence. Whenever he entered a party he hesitated a moment at the doorway and thought: “Who will be in there tonight?” For he had found that there was always someone.</p>

  <p class="normal">In his reflections during long days at sea young Whip never thought in polished terms of “milady’s glove” or “my dear Miss Henderson.” He thought of girls as strong young animals, naked and stretched out on a bed. That’s how he liked women and that’s how they liked to be when they were with him. They were utterly enjoyable playmates, and to think of them otherwise was a waste of energy. He made no distinctions as between married or unmarried women; he derived no special pleasure from cuckolding a married man; nor did he find women of any particular nationality or color especially desirable. If he could not gain entrance in Suez to the soiree of a French nobleman, he was quite content to pay down his livres at an established house and take his pick of the professional companions, but even though he often preferred this simple and direct method of acquiring a partner, he had also learned to be a professional gallant, and if he came upon some shy young lady who seemed worth the effort, he stood willing to humble himself before her as a traditional suitor out of a book, sending her flowers and candy, writing her short notes in his vigorous style, and dancing a rather impressive attendance upon her; for he always remembered his grandfather’s advice: “When your great-grandmother Malama lay dying, she weighed over four hundred pounds, and her husband crawled in to see her every morning on his hands and knees, bringing her maile. That’s not a bad thing for a man to do.” Young Whip loved women passionately. He knew that they complemented his life and he was willing to do almost anything to make them happy.</p>

  <p class="normal">As might be expected, his behavior when he returned from his seven years’ cruise took Honolulu rather by surprise. He completely terrified the Hale and Hewlett girls by professing to each in turn his Persian-Egyptian type of love, acquired, as he intimated, by long travels in a camel caravan toward ruined cities of antiquity. The poor girls never really understood what the dashing young man was talking about, but they did discover that he had a great determination to get their underwear off as quickly as possible, so that pretty soon it was agreed among the missionary daughters that they would prefer not to be escorted by their Cousin Whip. He discovered early that one of his full cousins, Nancy Janders, was amenable to his attentions, and they entered into a disgraceful series of performances that ended with Whip being caught in her bedroom completely stripped at five o’clock one morning. Nancy was not to be bullied by her parents and cried that a girl had a right to get to know young men, but that very night young Whip’s gig was left stranded at the entrance to Rat Lane down at the Iwilei brothels because a violent fight had broken out over an Arabian girl, and Whip had got cut across his left cheek with a sailor’s knife. The next day Nancy Janders’ father packed her off to the mainland and young Whip started fooling around with a Portuguese-Hawaiian girl, a great beauty whose grandfather had reached the islands via the Azores. She and Whip engaged in a brilliant courtship, marked by her riding openly with him through the gayer streets of the city and then hustling secretly off to California to have a baby.</p>

  <p class="normal">By this time some of the younger men of town had given the young seafarer his permanent name. It was bestowed following a brawl in which Whip fought three English sailors outside the impressive H &amp; H building on Fort Street. His austere father rushed down from his offices above the street in time to see his lithe son stretched out cold from a combination of a British blow to the side of the head and a stiff British kick to the groin. While the handsome boy lay in the dusty street, a nearby bartender doused him with a bucket of cold water, but as the fallen fighter gradually began to feel the throbbing pain in his crotch, he bellowed, “Somebody hit me again!” He looked up to see his father’s beard staring down at him and he wanted to faint from humiliation and pain, but he scrambled to his feet and hobbled off.</p>

  <p class="normal">From then on they called him “Wild Whip,” and he seemed dedicated to the principle that every man must prove his right to whatever nickname has been bestowed upon him. He did not drink much, nor did he engage in fist fights willingly. In many respects he was a clean, handsome young man. But if he did not seek trouble, neither did he avoid it, and he developed a characteristic gesture, when a fight loomed, of shrugging his shoulders and ambling a few lazy steps forward before exploding into furious action. Normally he would have lost his nickname as he grew older, for he became content to by-pass general brawls, and that aspect of his wildness diminished; but as it regressed, his passion for women increased, and it was his adventures in this field that constantly lured him back into trouble. He often recalled his grandfather’s apt simile: “Girls are like lovely little stars. You could reach up and pinch each one on the points.” Wild Whip’s capacity for reaching and pinching was insatiable, and in this he was a true grandson of Rafer Hoxworth.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he also resembled in many ways his maternal grandfather, Dr. John Whipple, for in addition to that gallant man’s physical handsomeness young Whip had inherited his abiding interest in science. Wherever he had gone during his seven years at sea, Whip had studied plants, grown to love local flowers, and collected specimens of trees and fruits that looked as if they might do well in Hawaii. But three particular discoveries had given him almost as much pleasure as leaping stalwartly into bed with a new girl. He had found the jungle orchids of Malaya positively enchanting, and he had gathered several dozen prime specimens of purple and crimson and burnt-gold beauties which he had shipped home by way of an H &amp; H freighter out of Singapore. They now flourished in a lath house which he had constructed in back of the Hoxworth home on Beretania Street, and it was a major characteristic of their owner that as soon as they established themselves in Hawaii, they were given freely to others who might fancy them. Young Whip made his money running ships and working plantations; the rare plants he brought into the islands were free to anyone who would care for them as diligently as he, so that in later years when Hawaii became famous for its orchids, that fame was but an extension of Whip Hoxworth’s personal concern with beauty. He also brought in ginger flowers, and two varieties of bird-of-paradise, that strange, almost unbelievable exotic which produced a burnished blue and red canoe out of which sprang a fantastic flower construction in purple and gold. All these Whip gave away.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was also responsible for both the Formosa and the New Guinea pineapple, establishing the former through the help of the Chinese vegetable huckster, Mrs. Kee. The latter, which was more acid and therefore much tastier, he failed to perpetuate. Twice in later years he endeavored to make this contrary pineapple grow, but with no success. He had his agents looking for a new strain which would combine the virtues of the Formosa and New Guinea types, but he did not find any.</p>

  <p class="normal">But his major contribution at this period was a tree which later came to bear his name. He found it growing near Bombay, and when he first tasted its fruit he cried, “This tree we’ve got to have in Hawaii.” Accordingly, he shipped four saplings home, but they died. He ordered four more and directed them to be planted in Kona on the big island, but they also died. He got four more, each in its own wash-tub of Bombay soil, and it was these that grew. When they produced their first fruit—a handsome hard rind that turned gold and red and speckled green, inside of which rested a big flat seed surrounded by delicious yellow meat—his neighbors asked what strange thing he had this time.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Watch!” he said crisply. “You’re about to taste the king of fruits.” He gripped one, took out his knife and gashed a complete circle around the long axis. Then he spun the knife, point-over-end, into the tree and with two hands gripped the halves of the fruit, twisting them in opposite directions. The fruit tore apart and for the first time the people of Hawaii tasted Whip’s luscious discovery.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like baked nuts with a touch of apple,” one man judged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Something like a peach with a trace of turpentine,” another said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it, Whip?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A Bombay mango,” Hoxworth replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We used to have mangoes around here years ago,” the man replied. “But as I recall they were stringy. Couldn’t hardly eat “em.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are mangoes and mangoes,” Whip agreed. “Trick is, to find the good ones. Then take care of them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In later years many people grew to despise Wild Whip Hoxworth, for he developed into the ruthless operator his grandfather had been. The extension of H &amp; H from merely a strong shipping line into the dictator-company of the islands was not accomplished easily, and if men hated Wild Whip they had a right to, but no one ever failed to remember with keen appreciation his first major gift to Hawaii. Whenever a hungry man reached up, knocked down a Hoxworth mango, circled it with his knife and sucked in the aromatic fruit, he instinctively paid tribute to Wild Whip. Other varieties came later, but the Hoxworth remained what its discoverer had once claimed it to be: “the king of fruits.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Whip saw his mangoes established and had given several hundred saplings away to his friends, he turned his attention to the affairs of H &amp; H, whereupon he ran headfirst into his bearded uncle, stern Micah Hale, a symbol of rectitude and a man determined not to have the H &amp; H empire sullied by the escapades of his wild young nephew. Consequently there was no opening for Whip. When he applied for a job, his grim-faced uncle stared at him over his copious beard and said, “You’ve outraged all the girls in our family, young man, and we have no place for you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not applying for a wife,” Whip snapped. “I’m applying for a job.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A man who isn’t appropriate for a husband, isn’t appropriate for a job … not with H &amp; H,” Uncle Micah replied, enunciating one of the firmest rocks of his company’s policies, for like most of the great emperors of history, the Hales and Whipples and Janderses realized that an institution had to go forward on two levels: it produced intelligent sons to carry on when the old men died, and it produced beautiful daughters to lure able young husbands into the enterprise. It was an open question as to whether the great families of Hawaii prospered most from selling sugar at a good price or their daughters to good husbands. “There’s no place for you in H &amp; H,” Uncle Micah said with finality.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Whip appealed to his father, he found that sensitive and confused weakling quite unwilling to fight with Micah, who now controlled the family ventures. “Your behavior has been such . . .” Whip’s father began plaintively, whereupon his son said, “Stow it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a good deal of argument within the family, but Uncle Micah said firmly, “Our success in Hawaii depends upon our presenting to the public an attitude of the most strict rectitude. There has never been a scandal in the big firms, and there won’t be as long as I control them. I think that Whipple ought to go. back to sea. We’ll reward him justly for his part ownership of the business, but he must stay out of Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then clever Micah thought of a happy solution. Recalling his nephew’s interest in growing things, he suggested a compromise: Wild Whip would divorce himself completely from all H &amp; H enterprises, and an announcement of this fact would be made public so as to absolve men like Micah Hale and Bromley Hoxworth from responsibility for his future actions, and in return Whip would be given four thousand acres of the family’s land to do with as he wished. When the assembled Hoxworths and Hales delivered this ultimatum to their errant son, Wild Whip smiled graciously, accepted the four thousand acres, and said evenly, “Jesus, are you goddamned missionaries going to regret this day!”</p>

  <p class="normal">He harnessed up two good horses and started westward to survey the lands he had been given. He drove some distance out of town, shaking the dust from his nose and staring at the bleak, grassless hills that rose to his right. Above them stood the barren mountains of the Koolau Range, and as far as he could see nothing grew. He drove past Pearl Harbor and out to where the land began to level off between the Koolau Mountains to the right and the Waianae Range to the left. Ahead lay his land. It was bleak, barren, profitless. Looking at it he recalled his Uncle Micah’s description of the deserts of western America when that young minister traversed them in 1849: “They were lands where nothing grew, not even grass.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Grimly amused, Wild Whip tied his horses to a rock, for there were no trees, and got out to study his inheritance at closer quarters. When he kicked away the surface growth of lichen and dried scrub grass, he found that the soil was a rich reddish color that his Grandfather Whipple had once explained as the result of the gradual breaking down of volcanic rocks. “It’s rich in iron,” Whip mused. “Probably grow things like mad if it could get water.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked back at Pearl Harbor and saw the wide expanse of salt sea water, useless to a farmer. He looked up at the sky and saw no clouds, for few arrived here with rain, and then he happened to look toward the Koolau Range to his right, and above its peaks he saw many dark clouds, riding in upon the trade winds that bore down constantly from the northeast, and he could almost smell the water falling out of those clouds. It fell, of course, on the other side of the mountains and gushed furiously down steep valleys and back out to sea. His Grandfather Whipple had trapped a little in his ditches, but the bulk was as useless as the salt water of Pearl Harbor.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was then that his great design came to him. “Why not build a tunnel right through the mountains and bring the water over here?” He visualized a system of ditches and dikes, all serving to bring the rich waters of the other side down to his parched lands. “I’ll build that tunnel!” he swore. “I’ll make this land so rich that by comparison Uncle Micah’s boats will be worth nothing.” He pointed his long right forefinger at the Koolau Range and announced to those impassive giants: “Some day I’m going to walk right through your bowels. Be ready.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Curiously, Whip’s great fortune was built in quite a different manner. When he saw that he was not wanted in his family’s business, and when he had finished inspecting his imperial and useless acres, he decided to leave Hawaii, and he did so in memorable fashion. He had never forgotten how relatively pleasant it had been sleeping surreptitiously with his responsive cousin, Nancy Janders, still banished to the mainland, and now as he was about to leave he began paying deadly court to her saucy younger sister Iliki. It was a whirlwind affair, interspersed with wild nights in Rat Alley with a little French girl, and it culminated in pretty Iliki’s slipping into men’s clothes as a passenger aboard a British freighter whose captain married her to Whip on the journey to San Francisco. When the joint families heard of the scandal, they prayed that young Iliki would find a happiness which they felt sure would escape her; but when, in America, Iliki’s older sister Nancy heard of the marriage she cried, “Damn them, damn them! I hope they both live in hell.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip didn’t, because he found considerable joy in his lively cousin, but Iliki did, for she discovered to her consternation and embarrassment that her husband had no intention of being loyal to her or of giving up his customary visits to local brothels. In San Francisco he had dashing affairs with several women of otherwise good repute, and a running relationship with two popular Spanish courtesans from a waterfront institution of ill fame. In other ways he was a good husband, and when his son was born in 1880, he insisted that the boy be named Janders Hoxworth after his wife’s father. He proved himself to be a doting husband and was obviously pleased to parade on Sunday after church with his wife on his arm and his son surrounded by lace in the perambulator which he proudly pushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in late 1880 Iliki’s sister visited them on her way back to Honolulu, and Nancy was now a striking New York beauty, and it was not long before Nancy’s hatred of Wild Whip became once more the passionate love she had earlier known for this gallant gentleman. At first Whip sneaked away to Nancy’s hotel, where they fell into wild, tormenting embraces. All the longing of three years rushed back upon poor Nancy Janders, and she abandoned restraint. She would lie in bed completely undressed, waiting for Whip to bound up the hotel stairs, and as soon as he burst into the room and locked the door, she would spring upon him and kiss him madly, throwing him onto the bed with laughter that welled up from her entire being. Sometimes she kept him imprisoned for a whole day, and it became obvious to her sister Iliki what was going on.</p>

  <p class="normal">At first the gay little wife could not imagine what she ought to do; she wondered whether she was supposed to break into the hotel room and confront the guilty pair or whether custom required her to weep silently, but her problems were resolved when on a day which took her shopping she returned unexpectedly to find that bold Nancy had trailed Whip to his own home, had undressed in Iliki’s room, and had pulled Whip into bed with her. When Iliki arrived, they stared up at her from her own sheets. Nobody made a scene. Nancy pouted: “I had him first. He’s decided to stay with me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Put some clothes on,” Iliki said, amazed at her restraint. When they were dressed Nancy announced defiantly, “Whip and I are going to live together.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Iliki did not bother to argue with her husband, for she knew that no matter what he promised, it was of no consequence. He was not like other men, and with deep sorrow--for she loved him very much --she saw that he was destined to bounce from one woman to another without ever resting with one, and she thought: “He’ll have a very lonely life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She left San Francisco with her son Janders and returned on an H &amp; H liner to Honolulu, where she lived a long, full life as a divorcee, doing much good in the community. The natural history museum flourished largely because of her energies.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her husband Whip and her sister Nancy enjoyed a wild time in San Francisco. Whip got a formal divorce but did not bother to marry Nancy, because, as he pointed out, “I’ll never make a good husband.” Nancy, finding in sex a complete gratification, was content to tag along on whatever terms he proposed, nor was she distressed when she uncovered suspicious circumstances that seemed to prove that her companion was also the consort of several well-known waterfront girls. What she liked best, however, apart from the passionate moments when he came home after a long absence, were the intense days when he took her with him to talk with men who had built tunnels. They were an odd, dedicated group of experts, willing to tackle nature on any terms, and they convinced Whip that if he could scrape together enough money, they could penetrate the Koolau Mountains and bring water to his dusty lands. Surreptitiously, he sent one of the engineer geologists to Hawaii, and in the guise of bird-collecting this keen fellow tramped the Koolaus and satisfied himself that tunneling them would present no unusual problems. “As a matter of fact,” he reported, “it looks to me as if the mountains were built in layers tilted on end. If that’s true, when you drill your tunnel you’ll not only collect all the water you trap in outside ditches to lead into your tunnel, but the porous rock above the tunnel will probably deliver an equal amount of its own. This could be a profitable undertaking, so far as water’s concerned.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How long would the tunnel have to be?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Eight, ten miles,” the engineer replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can you build a tunnel that long?” Whip asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Any tunnel is simply a function of money,” the engineer replied. “If you’ve got the money, I can get the dynamite.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In this case, how much?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Four million.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t forget my name,” Whip said.</p>

  <p class="normal">This report seemed to be the final answer to Whip’s land problem. He didn’t have the four million dollars then, but there was always a chance he might one day have it. He therefore decided to return to Hawaii, but Nancy Janders said, “I wouldn’t, Whip.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, Iliki’s there. That’ll be embarrassing for you. And I certainly can’t go back with you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think you should,” Whip said coldly, and a few days later he added, “You ought to be looking for a man for yourself, Nance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You through with me?” Nancy asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No place for you in Hawaii,” he said truthfully. “How you fixed for money?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The family sends me my share,” she assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nance,” he said in his most friendly manner, “I sure hope you have a wonderful life from here on out. Now you better get some clothes on.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She had been gone only a few hours when there was a knock at his hotel-room door, and a little man in an overcoat that reached down to his ankles entered. “My name’s Overpeck, Milton Over-peck, and I hear you’re interested in drilling a tunnel.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s right,” Whip said. “Sit down, Mr. Overpeck. You like whiskey?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I like anything,” Overpeck said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You a tunnel man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, yes and no,” the little man replied, gulping a huge draft of whiskey. Coughing slightly he asked, “I understand you’re drilling your tunnel in order to get water.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ve followed me around pretty well, Mr. Overpeck. Another whiskey?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, son, if you calculate on getting me drunk and outsmarting me, quit now, because you simply can’t do it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m offering it in hospitality,” Whip assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I never accept hospitality unless the host joins me. Now you gulp one down and catch up, and we can have a fine talk.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two men, Whip Hoxworth twenty-four years old and Milton Overpeck in his early fifties, guzzled straight whiskey for several hours, during which the little engineer fascinated the Hawaiian landowner with a completely new theory about water. The doughty drinker, whose eyes were bright and clear after three quarters of a bottle, apparently knew more about Hawaii than Whip did, at least about the island of Oahu.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My theory is this,” he explained, using pillows, books and newspapers to build his island. “This volcano here and this one here built Oahu. That’s perfectly obvious. Now, as they built, one surely must have overflowed the rightful terrain of the other. I judge all volcanic rock to be porous, so in Oahu it seems to me you have got to have a complex substructure, the bulk of it porous. All the fine water that falls on your island doesn’t run immediately out to sea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, the engineer I sent out there did say that he thought the mountains were probably porous,” Whip remembered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not interested in the mountains you see above land,” Overpeck snapped. “I’m interested in the subterranean ones. Because if, as I suspect, there was a rising and a falling of the entire mountain mass . . .” He stopped, studied his friend and said, “Sorry, you’re drunk. I’ll be back in the morning.” But as he was about to leave he said, “Don’t sleep on a pillow tonight. Leave everything just as it is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip, through bleary eyes, tried to focus on the turmoil in his room and asked, “What’s all this got to do with tunnels?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wouldn’t know,” Overpeck replied. “I’m a well man meself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He appeared at seven next morning, chipper as a woodchuck, his long overcoat flapping about his ankles in the cold San Francisco weather. He surprised Whip by completely dismissing the intricate construction of pillows, books and newspapers. “Best thing is to show you,” he said cheerily. “Wells‘11 be the making of Hawaii.” And he led Whip down to the foot of Market Street, where grimy ferries left for the other side of the bay, and when after a long walk through Oakland they stood before a well he had recently dug he pointed with unconcealed admiration at a pipe protruding from the ground, from which gushed a steady volume of water that rose fourteen feet into the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does it run like this all the time?” Whip asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Day and night,” Overpeck replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What does it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Artesian, that’s what it is. Artesian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many gallons a day?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A million four.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How long will it last?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was what Wild Whip had been dreaming of, a steady source of fresh water, but he had imagined that the only way to get it was to drive a tunnel through the mountains. If Overpeck were correct, where the water really lay was at his feet, but in business Whip was both daring and cautious. He was willing to take almost any gamble to obtain water, but he wanted assurance that he had at least a fair chance of winning. Carefully he asked, “Why did you have to bring me all the way over here to show me this well? Why didn’t you show me one in San Francisco?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Artesian water don’t happen everywhere,” Overpeck replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Suppose there isn’t any on my land in Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My job is to guess where it is,” Overpeck answered. “And I guess it’s under your land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what I was explaining with the pillows and the newspapers,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think we better go back to the hotel,” Whip said. “But wait a minute. How did you get the well down there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A special rig I invented.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How far down did you go?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hundred and eighty feet.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You want to sell the rig?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nope.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t think so.” The two men returned to the ferry, and as Whip studied the cold and windy hills of San Francisco, imagining them to be Hawaii, he became increasingly excited, but when little Mr. Overpeck assured him that a layer of cap rock must have imprisoned enormous stores of sweet water under the sloping flatlands of Oahu, Whip could feel actual perspiration break out on his</p>

  <p class="normal">forehead.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What kind of deal can we make, Overpeck?” he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re sweating, son. If I find water, I’m handing you millions of dollars, ain’t I?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m a gambler, Mr. Hoxworth. What I want is the land next to yours.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You pay for getting the rig over there. You give me three dollars a day. And you buy, before we start, one thousand acres of land. If we get water, I buy it from you for what you paid. If we don’t, you keep it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are the chances good?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s one way we can test my theory without spending a cent.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Think a minute. If there really is a pool of inexhaustible water hiding under your land, the overflow has got to be escaping somewhere. Logically, it’s running away under the sea level, but some of it must be seeping out over the upmost edge of the cap rock. Go out to your land. Tell people you’re going to raise cattle. Walk along the upper areas until you find a spring. Calculate how high above sea level you are, and then walk back and forth along that elevation. If you find half a dozen more springs, it’s not even a gamble, Mr. Hoxworth. Because then you know the water’s hiding down below you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You come out and check,” Whip suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“People might guess. Then land values go up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip reflected on this shrewd observation and made a quick decision. “Buy yourself a good bull. Bring him to the islands with you and we’ll announce that you’re going to help me raise cattle. Then everybody’ll feel sorry for me, because lots of people have gone bust trying that on the barren lands. Takes twenty of our acres to support one cow, and nobody makes money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Three weeks later little Mr. Overpeck arrived in Honolulu with a bull and announced to the Honolulu Mail that he was going to advise Mr. Whipple Hoxworth in the raising of cattle on the latter’s big ranch west of the city. He led his bull out to the vast, arid, useless acres, and as soon as he got there he told Whip, “Buy that land over there for me.” And Whip did, for practically nothing, and the next day he concluded that he had been victimized by the shrewd little man, for they tramped both Whip’s acres and Overpeck’s, and there were no springs.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why the hell did you bother me with your nonsense?” the young man railed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t expect any springs today,” Overpeck said calmly. “But I know where they’ll crop out after the next big storm up in the mountains,” and sure enough, three days after the rain clouds left, along the line that Overpeck had predicted, he and Whip discovered sure evidences of seepage. They stood on the hillside looking down over the bleak and barren acres, Whip’s four thousand and Over-peck’s one, and the little man said, “We’re standing on a gold mine, Mr. Hoxworth. I’m mortally certain there’s water below. Buy up all the land you can afford.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Eight weeks later the little man reappeared in Hawaii without any cattle, but with nine large boxes of gear. This time he informed the Mail: “It looks as if Mr. Hoxworth’s investment in cattle is going to be lost unless somehow we can find water on those acres.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He set up a pyramidal wooden derrick about twelve feet high, at the bottom of which were dung two large iron wheels connected by an axle upon which rope could be Wound when the wheels were turned by hand. This rope went from the axle and up to the top of the derrick, where it crossed on a pulley and dropped down to be lashed to the end of a heavy iron drill. Laboriously Overpeck cranked the heavy wheels until the iron drill was hauled to the top of the derrick. Then he tripped a catch and jumped back as the drill plunged downward, biting its way through sand and rock. Laboriously he turned the wheels and lifted the drill back into position; then a swift whirrrrr, and the next bite was taken.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How long will this take?” Hoxworth asked, amazed at the effort required.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A long time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you the strength?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m boring for a million dollars,” the wiry little man replied. “I got the strength.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Days passed and weeks, and the determined engineer kept hoisting his drills, breaking their points on almost impenetrable hard pan, sharpening them by hand, and hoisting them once more. “You ought to have an engine,” Whip growled as the work made slow progress.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When I get some money, I’ll get an engine,” Overpeck snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Whip saw the little fighter in a new light. “All your life you’ve been broke, haven’t you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yep. All my life I was waiting for a man like you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are we going to hit water?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yep.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At two hundred feet the drills were hammering their way through cap rock, once soft ocean mud but now, millions of years later, rock as hard as diamonds. Whip grew despondent and was afraid to pass through the streets of Honolulu, where people already hated him for the way he had treated his former wife, Iliki Janders, and where they now laughed at him for his folly in trying to raise cattle on his barren acres. At first, when those who had sold additional land saw Overpeck’s drilling rig, there had been consternation: “Has Whip bamboozled us? Did he know there was water below that rubble? Such fears relaxed when it was apparent that no water existed. “He’s down to two hundred and fifty feet and is running out of rope,” spies reported.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then on the fourteenth of September, 1881, Milton Over-peck’s plunging drill crashed through the last two inches of cap rock, and up past the iron, past the rope, gushed cold sweet water at the rate of one million three hundred thousand gallons a day. When it gurgled to the top of the well it kept rising until it reached the apex of the twelve-foot derrick and stood a steady fourteen feet in the air, hour after hour, month after month.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Whip saw the glorious sight he became agitated and cried, “We must save that water!” But little Mr. Overpeck assured him, “Son, it’ll run forever.” They scooped out a large depression in which the water was impounded and then pumped to wherever it was needed. They drilled additional wells, all by hand, and Whip said, “Overpeck, it’s ridiculous for you to do so much work. Let’s buy an engine that’ll do it for you,” but the determined little man replied, “I finish these wells, I’m never going to work again. I’m going to get a hotel room, lease my land to you, and live easy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He did all these things, but he had failed to anticipate the natural future of a man like Overpeck in Hawaii. One of the unmarried Janders girls smelled him out, checked the land records to be sure he owned the land he said he did, and married him. Thus his thousand acres was brought safely back into the grand alliance of Hoxworth-Whipple-Hale-Janders-Hewlett.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip worked like a maniac organizing his own acres, now six thousand, plus the thousand he leased from Overpeck, and by means of pumps and ditches brought water to all of it. He bought out the old Malama Sugar Plantation and transferred its name and operation to his new lands. Then, with the touch of genius that characterized his business dealings, at the age of twenty-six he turned the entire management of his sugar lands over to Janders &amp; Whipple, and he set out to see more of the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">In late 1883 he returned to Honolulu with a cargo of new orange trees from Malaya; some excellent coffee beans from Brazil; the amazing torch ginger flower, a red slashing thing; and a tall, dark Spanish wife Aloma Duarte Hoxworth, who quickly bore him a son whom she insisted upon calling Jesus Duarte Hoxworth and whom Honolulu called Jadey, derived from his initials. Aloma Hoxworth was a sensation in the islands, for she was by nature an exotic creature and she quickly announced to her husband that his days of roistering on Rat Alley were ended. But it was easier for her to issue such instructions than to enforce them, so one night when Whip came home from delightful hours with a Chinese prostitute, Aloma Duarte tried to carve him up with a long knife. She gashed him badly across the scar in his left cheek, but before she could strike again he kicked her in the stomach, knocked her breathless against the wall, and proceeded to break her jaw and wrist.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No one comes at me with a knife,” he explained publicly, and when the -once-beautiful woman was mended she decided to bring brutality charges against him in the Honolulu courts, but against her stood the mute testimony of the jagged gash in Wild Whip’s cheeks, and her lawyers advised her to drop charges. When she did so, Micah Hale, Bromley Hewlett and Mark Whipple visited her and advised her that they were ready to provide her with a small but adequate annuity if she would agree to leave the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s no&#160; place&#160; for&#160; you here,”&#160; Micah&#160; explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m taking Jadey with me,” she threatened.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whip won’t allow that,” her father-in-law warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jadey is for me!” Aloma Duarte stormed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He belongs in the islands,” Micah reasoned with her, and in the end she left exactly as the family had originally planned, with exactly the annuity they had suggested. In New York she told a friend, “I was more afraid of the three bearded ones than I was of my husband. He comes at you with his fists, but they soft-talk you to death. In Hawaii they run things pretty much their own way. But they were generous.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And west of Honolulu, the once barren lowlands that had formerly required twenty acres to nourish a cow, blossomed into the lushest, most profitable agricultural lands in the world. When the sugar cane stood eight feet tall, bursting with juice, for mile after mile you could not see the red volcanic soil, nor could you see the water that Wild Whip had brought to it. All you could see was money.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1885 Nyuk Tsin could no longer postpone decision about her sons, and as she studied Ah Chow, Au Chow, Fei Chow, Mei Chow and Oh Chow she realized both how difficult her job was going to be and how important. At Iolani, the Church of England school, she was giving the boys the best education available to them on the islands. Had they been able to get into Punahou, they would have learned more and would have associated with the missionary children who were destined to rule Hawaii, but for both financial and social reasons, entry there was forbidden, and they had done well at the second-rate school.</p>

  <p class="normal">But now the older boys were ready for advanced education, and it was clear that each merited college and university. They were bright boys, well behaved, industrious and alert. Their pigtails were well tended and they had learned to keep their nails clean. They had good teeth and clear skins. They were reasonably good at games and spoke four languages with skill: Punti, Hakka, Hawaiian and English. Each was above high-school ability in mathematics and abstract reasoning, and to choose among them the boy on whose shoulders the entire burden of the family should fall was difficult indeed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was confused as to which of her boys ought to go to America, nor could she decide what he ought to study when he got there. In early 1885, therefore, she began her long inquiry, starting with Uliassutai Karakoram Blake, and he wasn’t of much help because he vigorously espoused two directly conflicting criteria. As an Englishman he swore: “No boy is worth educating unless he’s proved himself good at games. Europe is the one. He has spirit and quickness of hand. He looks you in the eye when he gives you an answer. Fine, clean cut lad to be trusted. Grow up to be a substantial man.” That much was easy to understand, but when Uliassutai had said that--sort of in deference to British tradition-- he promptly added, “But of course England’s the only place in the world where a man can get ahead simply because he has good character and the brain of an ass. Everywhere else you have to have intelligence, and let’s face up to it, Wu Chow’s Auntie, your son Europe is an ass, and I’m afraid that’s done it. The only one who shows the quick intelligence required in a scholar is America. But he’s so appalling at games I can never take him seriously. Probably turn out to be a pretty poor sort in the end, a thinker and all that. I’d never waste me money on him, but in France he’d likely end up in the cabinet.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin pretty well agreed with Uliassutai in his analysis of the two boys. Europe was going to make friends wherever he went and was a fine, congenial boy, not too good at books, but an admirable son. America was clearly the ablest but he had a shy, withdrawing quality that sometimes frightened her. She concluded that what Blake was saying, in his cryptic way, was that he could not make the final choice.</p>

  <p class="normal">Apikela and Kimo were certainly not obscure. “The only one is Australia,” they said firmly. “He speaks such good Hawaiian he sounds educated already.” When Nyuk Tsin tried to press them on things like character, ability to work, or insight in business they gave a quick, easy answer: “Only one’s Australia. When he sings a song, you can hear the words so beautifully.” Nyuk Tsin pointed out: “You two are with the boys more than I am. What do you see in them?” And again the answer was direct: “Australia is the one who will lead a happy life, because he has such a handsome smile and he knows how to laugh.” Whenever the boy visited the Kee house, slipping away from his Hawaiian parents, Nyuk Tsin would hear him joking with Kimo and Apikela, and once when she said to him, “Maybe you will go to America for your education,” he had replied, “I like it here.” His friends were divided into four almost equal groups: Punti, Hakka, Hawaiians and haoles. At Iolani he was elected president of his class and sang in the glee club. “Then you would send Australia to college?” Nyuk Tsin pressed, and big Apikela replied, “Oh, yes! He’d have a lot of fun at college.” Nyuk Tsin pointed out: “But we’re sending him to study,” and the Hawaiians laughed, “Give him just as much as his tired little head will take, and forget the rest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Chinese community was again fairly clear in its recommendation. Partly because Asia was the oldest son and therefore to be respected unless he proved himself inadequate, but mainly because he had already opened a restaurant on Hotel Street that did a good business, he was their overwhelming choice. The Punti said, “This boy can be trusted. He buys wisely and sells with intelligence. At nineteen he’s already a better businessman than my son at twenty-five. I wish he were my boy.” The Hakka told Nyuk Tsin: “We have watched your boys for some years, and the others sometimes seem more Hawaiian than Chinese, but Asia is different. He has a real Chinese understanding, and he will do well.” Few Chinese deviated from this strong recommendation, and when Nyuk Tsin arranged a marriage for him with a Punti wife whose father owned land, he built himself even more solidly into the Chinese community. Asia Kee was bound to become a powerful man.</p>

  <p class="normal">That left Africa, the middle son. He excelled neither in games nor in books, nor was he inclined toward business or singing. His face was rather squarish and unlike his brothers he wore his pigtail tied at the end in a blunt knot. He would fight anyone who got in his way, but he was not offensively aggressive. His principal characteristic was hesitancy in making up his mind, accompanied by a bulldog tenacity when he had done so. His personal affections were kept well masked: he had no special regard for either Uliassutai Blake, Apikela or Wu Chow’s Auntie. He studied each of them and knew their strengths but not their love. His brothers rarely shouted to him to join them in a game, but they often asked him the schedule for the next day’s lesson. His mother studied him with a good deal of care and concluded: “In his stubborn, square-faced way, Africa is deeper than the others.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She had almost as much trouble trying to decide what the chosen son should study if he got to America. Here Uliassutai Bake was clear-cut in his advice: “The world is run by those who can manipulate, Wu Chow’s Auntie. There are only two decent vocations open to a man of talent. He should become a messiah and lead us into eternal darkness, or he should study to be a lawyer, and then God alone knows what he may accomplish. If I were a lawyer I would run for Parliament. If your son becomes a lawyer he will coach you in how to cheat the government, and heaven knows, that’s to be learned by all of us. Lawyer, Wu Chow’s Auntie, nothing less.” When she asked him, “Who would make the best lawyer?” he replied without equivocation, “America.” She thought the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kimo and Apikela were of no help. They pondered the problem for a long time, their great brown bodies wrestling with strange ideas, and finally Kimo asked, “Why should fine boys like this be anything? Asia has a restaurant. Europe has a store. Australia has more friends than anyone in school. They like Hawaii. They fit in. Why bother them with all these big ideas?” Nyuk Tsin, who appreciated the insight of these huge friends, asked, “But which do you like better, a lawyer or a doctor or a dentist?” The two Hawaiians studied this for some time and replied, “For a Hawaiian a lawyer is better because he makes such wonderful speeches, but for a Pake maybe a doctor is better because he makes so much money.” The Chinese community was more practical. The Punti almost to a man advised medicine: “A doctor is always respected. He gets paid. He becomes a leading man in the city, and we need Chinese doctors.” The Hakka pointed out: “It takes two more years to become a doctor. Leave that to the haoles. Your boy should be a dentist. Quicker and in the long run, just as much money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One hot July day in 1885 Nyuk Tsin was hurrying down Nuuanu, her two baskets of pineapples balancing on her carrying-pole the way conflicting advice balanced in her mind, and she was thinking of lawyer versus doctor and Asia versus America when two horses pulling a J &amp; W dray reared in the air, dashed down Hotel Street, and threw their wagon against one of the poles that held up the roof of Asia Kee’s Chinese restaurant. The first pole snapped off and the sudden weight thrown upon the second caused it to collapse, allowing the roof to fall into Hotel Street. No one was hurt and a Hawaiian caught the reins of the runaway horses and easily brought them to rest.</p>

  <p class="normal">Asia, who was&#160; inside the restaurant,&#160; exploded onto&#160; the street shouting curses at the horses who had so unexpectedly plunged his dining room into chaos. Nyuk Tsin hurried up, adding to the confusion by shouting, “I saw them! I saw them!” And the Hawaiian policemen agitated everyone by roaring, “Don’t bring those horses back this way! Turn them around and get them out of here!” When the beasts reared he bellowed, “Turn them around!” A man from J &amp; W hurried up to assure everyone that the driver was at fault because he had stopped to watch a pool game, and was going to be fired; and then amidst the confusion Nyuk Tsin, herself in great agitation, saw her son Africa, who had been helping wash dishes at his brother’s restaurant, moving among the crowd and quietening the Chinese. “All right, Wu Chow’s Auntie!” he said forcefully. “No more shouting. Nobody’s hurt. Did you see what happened? Where were you standing?” And while the policeman fought with the man who had caught the horses, making him turn them around lest they stampede again, Africa Kee quietly got the names of all who had witnessed the accident. “The driver was nowhere to be seen?” he asked repeatedly. “You saw the wagon hit the pole?” By the time Africa reached the J &amp; W man, the latter’s story about the driver’s having been in a poolroom had been changed. It was now quite a different story, but Africa had the names of everyone who had heard the first version. The extent of the damage was not great, and the cash award grudgingly given by J &amp; W did not amount to much, but restitution was made and the money went into the fund that would send Africa Kee to Michigan … to become a lawyer.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was seventeen years old when Wu Chow’s Auntie made her decision, and the family had practically no spare cash to spend on their living in Hawaii, let alone to send a boy to America. Yet in those important days Nyuk Tsin started many ventures. She made Asia and Europe, who were already in business, borrow money to pay Africa’s ship passage. She sold pineapples and vegetables six hours a day, tilled her fields eight hours and kept two for scouting around. Finally, one evening when the scholar at the Punti store assured her that the time was auspicious, she washed her muddy feet, brushed her one blue uniform, tied a widow’s cloth about her sparsely haired head and topped it with her wicker hat. Brushing her cheeks with her hands so that she might look as presentable as possible, she left home without speaking to anyone, and walked resolutely down Nuuanu, where she purchased a bag of brown, chewy candies covered with poppy seed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Clutching the candy in her hand, she entered busy Hotel Street, in the heart of Chinatown, and turned right, walking past Asia’s restaurant and Europe’s vegetable stand, while she looked for a narrow alley that cut back among a maze of Chinese shacks. At last she found it, and with a prayer to Kwan Yin for mercy on her mission, she ducked beneath the bamboo poles that suspended drying laundry completely across the alley. Finally she reached the kitchen door which belonged to a house somewhat more pretentious than the rest, yet one of which few haoles could have known the existence, for it was well hidden by hovels. This was the home of Ching, Honolulu’s wealthiest Hakka, and it was presumptuous of Nyuk Tsin to be calling there. She knocked and waited obediently until the tall, well-fed mistress of the house appeared and looked out in the darkness to identify her impecunious visitor. The taller woman did not speak, and Nyuk Tsin said deferentially, “May a thousand benedictions fall upon you on this auspicious night, my dear mother-in-law.” The phrase was an honorary one and implied no relationship, so the wealthy woman accepted it imperiously and said, “Come in, my dear sister-in-law. Have you had your meal?”</p>

  <p class="normal">This again was a formality, so Nyuk Tsin replied, as custom required, “I have eaten, but how about you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">She was impressed by the munificence of the kitchen and its close attention to detail. The two windows were sufficiently high so that the Ching money could not leak out; the doors were not in a straight line, which kept the dragon of happiness from escaping; and the land leading up to the doors did not slope away from the house, so that good fortune did not drift away. The kitchen had a brick stove on which a permanent teapot rested, and now the Ching woman poured Nyuk Tsin a cup of the stale stuff, not too big a cup, which would have accorded Nyuk Tsin an esteem she did not merit, nor too small, which would have brought reflections of niggardliness upon the Chings.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Be seated, my dear sister-in-law,” the wealthy woman said. In her outward appearance, nothing betrayed the fact that she controlled a good deal of money. She wore no jewelry, no paint, no combs in her hair. Her simple dress was the same as Nyuk Tsin’s and she also was barefooted; but to her visitor’s calculating eye Mrs. Ching was obviously a person of wealth: her kitchen was crowded with food! Three hams hung from bamboo poles, and five glistening dried ducks, their bills hanging downward with drops of redolent oil gathering at the tips. There were bunches of white cabbage, baskets of vegetables and bags of nuts. Throughout the kitchen there was the grand confusion loved by people who have money, and Mrs. Ching grandly swept aside some of the clutter that hid her table, making a small space on which Nyuk Tsin placed her bag of candies. Neither woman spoke of the bag, but each was painfully aware of its presence, and as the conversation developed, they stared at the candies with positive fascination.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why do you come to my poor house on such an auspicious night, by dear sister-in-law?” the older woman asked with studied sweetness.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin sat with her stubborn, hard-working hands folded in her lap and her brown feet flat on the floor. Bluntly she said, “Since I am not as wealthy as my honored mother-in-law, I cannot afford to hire a go-between, so I have been shameful and have broken the rules of decent behavior. I have come to ask for your daughter, Siu Kim.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Ching showed no surprise, but unconsciously she drew back and took her hands far from the candies. Nyuk Tsin detected this and was hurt, but she continued to smile frankly at her hostess. Finally, after an awkward moment, Mrs. Ching said in a silken voice, “I thought your son Ah Chow already had a wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He does, my dear mother-in-law,” Nyuk Tsin replied evenly, launching her first barb of the evening. “I arranged a very fine marriage for him with the Lam girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Ching said, “A Punti, I believe?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin dropped her eyes modestly and confessed: “A Punti, yes, but she brought a good deal of gold with her and now my son owns his restaurant.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He owns the building?” Mrs. Ching inquired in surprise.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Completely,” Nyuk Tsin said with firmness, “but of course our family controls it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was my understanding that your second son was intending to marry a Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is,” Nyuk Tsin confessed. She waited so that Mrs. Chine could react with distaste, then added quietly, “I was able to find him a Hawaiian girl with several large pieces of land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Indeed! And does the land now belong to your family?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It does.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mmmmmm,” Mrs. Ching mused. She leaned forward ever so slightly and the talk resumed. She said, “I observe that your youngest son plays mainly with Hawaiians. I suppose that one day he will marry one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are many Hawaiian girls who seem to like my son, and fortunately they all have large land holdings,” Nyuk Tsin said. Then, to establish herself on an equal footing with Mrs. Ching, she added boldly, “Since my family will not return to China, I think it best that the boys find wives here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So that you were even willing to allow your oldest son to marry a Punti?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin was not going to be stampeded by this woman. With a good deal of self-possession she said, “I want my family to live in the new style. Not as in the High Village that you and I knew as girls.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Ching sensed a rebuke in these words and said bluntly, “What you mean is that you are building a family into which a decent Hakka girl, like my daughter Siu Kim, would hardly want to marry and into which I would not permit her to marry.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was an important speech, for although it was harsh, Nyuk Tsin did not know whether Mrs. Ching was formally ending negotiations or whether she was trying legitimately to undermine Nyuk Tsin’s bargaining position so that when final discussions of money came up, the girl’s side could drive a harder bargain. At any rate, Nyuk Tsin felt that the time ‘had come for her to detonate her first bomb, so she dropped it gently, letting it explode among the hams and glistening dried ducks. “I realize, my dearest mother-in-law, that a wealthy woman like you would have objections to marrying a fine girl like Siu Kim into a poor family like ours, but there is one thing you have overlooked. Yesterday the scholar at the Punti store cast my son Africa’s horoscope,” and she placed on the crowded table, beside the bag of candy, a slip of paper, “and when it was done, the scholar gasped for sheer pleasure, for he said, ‘I have never seen a finer horoscope for a young man in my entire life.’ That’s what he said.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two women, neither of whom could read, studied the precious slip of paper, and Mrs. Ching asked cautiously, “Are you sure this is your son’s?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And it speaks well?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Modestly Nyuk Tsin looked down at her feet. In a soft voice she said, “Money, knowledge, a position even better than a scholar in China, a long prosperous life with many children—those were the words for my son.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two women sat in silence, for each knew what a rare thing was before them. They stared at the premonitory paper and slowly Mrs. Ching rose. “My dear sister-in-law, I think I had better make some more tea.” With bounding joy Nyuk Tsin heard these words, for they erased any that had been said earlier, but modestly she kept her eyes down and did not watch Mrs. Ching as she brewed fresh tea—not the old stuff waiting on the back of the stove—and poured it into a fine China cup. This was, up to then, the moment of greatest triumph in Nyuk Tsin’s life, and she tasted the fine fresh tea.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Siu Kim,” Mrs. Ching began on a fresh tack, “is an unusual girl and she has been asked for by more than a dozen men, some of them with considerable wealth.” Nyuk Tsin sipped her tea and courteously allowed Mrs. Ching to run up the bargaining price for her daughter. Over the edge of her cup, the ruder-mannered younger woman studied the bag of candies and thought: “I will let her talk about her daughter for five minutes, and then I’ll explode my next cannon.” When Mrs. Ching finished explaining why, in common decency, she had to save Siu Kim for a wealthier man than Africa Kee was apt to be, Nyuk Tsin said bluntly, “It is not every day that an average Hakka girl like Siu Kim has a chance to marry a man who is going to graduate from a fine college in America and become a lawyer. I should think, as her mother, that you would jump at this opportunity and throw in a good dowry as well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Ching was stunned by this news, but she was no mean negotiator. She did not raise an eyebrow but asked in a silky voice, “How can a vegetable woman possibly send her son to America?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Meticulously Nyuk Tsin counted off: “We own the land up Nuuanu. We own the land in the forest. We own very fine fields in Manoa. Asia owns his restaurant and Europe has paid large sums toward the building where his vegetable store is. Each of my sons works, as do I, and I am sure that right now we have enough money to send Africa to Michigan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Ching was visibly jolted by this narration and she now wheeled into position her heaviest ammunition: “Your son’s prospects sound . . . well, interesting. But of course his father was a leper.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin did not flinch: “The main reason why I was able to make such a favorable marriage with the Hawaiian girl, who brought us so much land, was that the Hawaiians know me as the Pake Kokua, and they have said that if Africa does become a lawyer, they will send all their business to the son of ‘the Pake Kokua.” The two tough-minded Hakka women glared at each other in mutual respect, and as they did so, Mrs. Ching made her decision. Imperceptibly, she allowed her right hand to steal across the table. She extended two fingers and slowly encircled the bag of brown candy dusted with poppy seeds. Noiselessly she pulled it toward her, and Nyuk Tsin, witnessing these climactic gestures, thought: “I must not cry.” And she fought back her tears, lest they spill out of her sloping eyes and betray to the Ching woman her great joy. With this acceptance of the candy, the marriage was agreed upon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Up to this time Nyuk Tsin had not yet seen Siu Kim, and of course Africa Kee was not even aware that his auntie was planning his marriage. Neither he nor Siu Kim was told anything, especially since the basic financial negotiations were to consume the better part of a year, but one day Nyuk Tsin saw the attractive girl for whom she had been bargaining, and she admitted to Mrs. Ching: “Your daughter, Beautiful Gold, is even more desirable than you told me.” But as she said these words, she happened to look past Siu Kim, who was then thirteen, and in the doorway behind, wearing a blue and gold Chinese dress, stood Siu Kim’s eleven-year-old sister, Siu Han, and Nyuk Tsin sucked in her breath with pleasure. “What is that one’s name?” she asked, and Mrs. Ching replied simply, “Siu Han, Beautiful Girl, but she will be saved for a very wealthy man.” Nyuk Tsin smiled at the little girl and remembered her name.</p>

  <p class="normal">These were exciting years in the Kee house. The original grass shack had been replaced by one of the ugliest buildings in Honolulu: an unadorned two-story bleak wooden house, to which had been appended as afterthoughts a collection of lean-to sheds. A mango tree and a coconut palm gave some shade, but there was no lawn nor any flowers. Pigs were kept in the yard and chickens in the kitchen, but the dominant occupants were enormous Kimo, who did all the cooking for the family, and sprawling Apikela, who did the washing and made the poi. There was a running battle between Nyuk Tsin on the one hand and everyone else on the other: she liked rice and Chinese food; they insisted upon poi and American-style food. When, at the end of a long day’s work she begged for rice, big Kimo at the stove shrugged his shoulders and the boys yelled, “Oh, Auntie! Who wants rice?” If she did, she had to cook it herself because Kimo refused to bother.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her two married sons lived with her, of course, one family to a room, and Apikela took care of the babies that began to arrive regularly. What with the pigs and the chickens and the babies it was a noisy, happy island home. There were many like it, for Chinese and Hawaiians lived together easily. At the poolroom one day Kimo came upon a new importation from Portugal, a ukulele, and like a boy he badgered Nyuk Tsin until she bought him one. Then Apikela demanded one, and Europe’s wife, and songs from the Chinese house filled the valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the middle of 1886, when Africa Kee was eighteen, it was announced that early next year he would marry the wealthy Hakka girl, Ching Siu Kim. He started looking about the city to see who she was, and one day he saw her walking in Aula Park, but he could not be sure that she was the girl picked out for him, and he thought: “It would be pleasant if she were a girl like that one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The wedding was an impressive affair, with many guests, for the Chings were important, and before Africa Kee finally climbed aboard the ship to go to Michigan, he was already the father of three children. Dutifully he took the family genealogical book and the poem to the scholar in the Punti store, and there the man gave his sons their names. The poem showed that the name of this fourth generation must be Koon, Earth, and accordingly the two boys’ names were Koon Chuk, the Center of the Earth, and Koon Yuen, the Essence of the Earth Which Produces All, but their parents called them simply Sam and Harvey. The Chinese names were duly forwarded to the Low Village, so that when twenty-one-year-old Africa finally enrolled at Michigan he was not only head of a burgeoning family left behind in Honolulu, but also the member of a powerful clan whose existence had continued in the Low Village for thousands of years, but the memory which recurred most often to Africa as he studied law in Michigan concerned an event which took place on his last morning in Honolulu.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin assembled her five sons and led them to the letter-writer at the Punti store. There she delivered fifty dollars that the family in Honolulu desperately needed for its various ventures. Asia and Europe gasped to see this amount of money being stolen from the Kees, and certainly Africa could have used it in Michigan, but Nyuk Tsin said, “Your mother in China may need this money. It may be a bad year for the crops. It is your duty above everything else to pay respect to your mother.” If, at Michigan, Africa Kee excelled at law it was partly because he understood the fundamental fact that law directs the ongoing of society. It is rooted in the past, determines the present, and protects the future. Better than any other student in the law school, Africa appreciated these conservative principles.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the day he sailed to America on the H &amp; H liner Molokai, Nyuk Tsin climbed aboard a little island steamer and made her first pilgrimage to her husband’s grave at the leper settlement of Kalawao, for she, too, was imbued with this sense of continuity, and if her ablest son was that day setting forth for a new world, it was only because the dead gambler Kee Mun Ki had been good to her. This time the island steamer did not swing around the peninsula and throw its passengers brutally ashore into the cold and unprotected hell of Kalawao. The vessel sailed directly to the pier at Kalaupapa, on the kindly side of the peninsula, and discharged its cargo decently. Doctors and nurses were on hand to assist the new lepers, and the big white Missionary Home for Lepers provided them a place to sleep. At the Missionary Hospital they still found no medicine that combated the disease itself, but they found charitable care that protected them from pneumonia and tuberculosis, which had once been so prevalent.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin walked through the clean new settlement and up past the volcano crater. Then she stopped and an ache past understanding assailed her, for she looked down upon the most beautiful sight she had ever seen. It was more dramatic than the hills of China, lovelier than the valleys of Honolulu. In the distance rose the soaring cliffs of Molokai, with white spray beating upon their rock bases and gossamer waterfalls leaping from their summits to fall three thousand silvery feet. The ocean was blue and the small islands that clustered offshore formed handsome patterns. The fields of Kalawao, now empty of lepers, were soft and green as they had been a thousand years before that horrible disease was known in the islands. Two vacant churches, one Protestant and one Catholic, stood where once there had been terror. The house she had built with her own hands no longer had a roof. “How sweet,” she thought, “were the days Mun Ki and Palani and I spent there. Oh, how I wish I could see those two good men once more.” In her mind’s eye she saw them not with noses and lips falling away and with stumps of hands, but as men. “How I would like to see them once more playing fan-tan on the shore.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night she spent at Kalawao in the home of a kokua she had known years before, and on the next morning at cockcrow, in the third hour, she left the house and went to her husband’s grave, so that she would be there when his spirit rose to walk about the valley. In the moonlight she carefully replaced any rocks that had fallen away. She brushed the earth and pulled weeds. Carefully she erected a slab on which his name, Kee Mun Ki, had been printed in gold letters. Then she undid a bundle and ceremoniously placed a fine set of new dishes about the grave, putting into them the three required delicacies: roast pig, chicken and fish. On saucers she placed oranges, boiled rice, little cakes with caraway, and brown candies with poppy seed. Then she lit a small candle, so that its incense would infuse the atmosphere and make it congenial to the ghost, and when these preparations were completed, she waited for the dawn.</p>

  <p class="normal">When her husband’s ghost appeared he found no tree to roost in, as he would have expected in China, where trees were plentiful and where they were kept near graves for just that purpose, but he did find a perching place on the rocky cliffs that rose behind his grave, and there in the warm sunlight, away from the cold ocean breezes, he sat with his dutiful wife.</p>

  <a id="section_3"></a>

  <p class="normal">She explained in a quiet voice: “Three of the boys are married, Wu Chow’s Father, and although I was not able to arrange perfect marriages with huge dowries, I did as well as could be expected. Mrs. Ching, as you would expect, argued very strongly against me, and at the last she even brought up an unpleasant fact. ‘Your husband died of leprosy,’ she said, but I didn’t lose my temper, for there was more important business at hand, and at last she gave in.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah Chow has four children, Au Chow has three and Fei Chow three. I am going to try very hard to get Mrs. Ching’s youngest daughter to marry Oh Chow, but I may have a good deal of trouble there, for the girl is a beauty and will be able to command a high price.</p>

  <p class="normal">“At the house things go well. Kimo and Apikela look after things for us all, and they are precious people. The fields yield as before, and pineapples continue to sell well. Ah Chow has a fine restaurant that is always busy and Au Chow has a good vegetable business.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the good news, Wu Chow’s Father, is that your son Fei Chow is already on a ship going to Michigan to study to be a lawyer. When I put him aboard the vessel I could see you and Palani in our little house down there, dreaming of going around the world and seeing strange places.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Think! Think! Our son, our own child, is going to be a scholar!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In gratitude for this great boon Nyuk Tsin fell silent and tears trembled on her lids, and the sun rose higher in the heavens, and she stayed by the grave. At eleven she asked, “Is it not hot on those rocks? You really ought to have a tree, Wu Chow’s Father.” And in the later afternoon she left the grave and the meal she had set for the ghost.</p>

  <p class="normal">On her walk back toward Kalaupapa she passed the old graveyard and saw a new stone, larger than the others, and she wondered who of her friends lay buried there, so she waited until a Hawaiian leper came by with hardly any face, and she asked him, “Who lies in that grave?” And the man said, “Father Damien. He died one of us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When she reached Kalaupapa she found that while she was talking with her husband the settlement had discovered who she was, and she returned to see many people waiting for her. “Pake Kokua!” they called, and many came to greet her who had known her in the evil days. Some she recognized, for the disease had been kind to them, but others no eyes but God’s could see as human beings. “Pake Kokua!” they all cried. “It’s good to have you back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She sat down on a rock, a little Chinese woman with a sunburned face, and they gathered around. A priest came up and asked in Hawaiian, “Are you the one they call the Pake Kokua?” She said that she was, and he said, “You are remembered in this place.” She asked if it was true that Father Damien had died of leprosy, and the priest said, “Only last spring.” “Did he suffer?” Nyuk Tsin asked, and the priest replied, “Here everyone suffers.” She said, “Kalaupapa is better than Kalawao used to be,” and the young man said, “When the people in Honolulu wakened to their responsibility, it had to become better.” She asked, “Have you found any drug that cures?” And he replied, “The infinite mercy of God has not yet shown us the way, but He will not permit a thing like leprosy to continue without a cure. Meanwhile, we pray.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In late 1889 Nyuk Tsin spent most of her spare time arguing with the Ching family about terms on which their youngest daughter, Ching Siu Han, might be given to her youngest son Australia. She told Mrs. Ching frankly, “The boy is very good at school, and I don’t worry about him in that regard, but having grown up with Hawaiians he is more like them than a Chinese. He’s got to marry a Chinese girl. Otherwise he will be lost to us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Ching pointed out: “You allowed Au Chow and Mei Chow to marry Hawaiian girls.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin argued: “Those girls brought much land with them, and the marriages were good for the boys. But Oh Chow’s problem is different. He doesn’t require land. He requires a strong-minded Chinese wife.” But her antagonist felt that Siu Han, being rather prettier than average, ought to be saved for a better prospect than Australia.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this time Siu Han, who was now a sparkling Chinese girl of fifteen, had begun to show her headstrong nature and had broken away from the severe old Chinese custom which required girls to hide at home. While her sister, Africa’s wife, tended her three babies, Siu Han liked to walk up and down Hotel Street, and because she was unusually attractive this caused much comment in the Chinese community. On one such trip she met Nyuk Tsin, who said to her, “Have you ever seen my son Australia?” “No,” the girl said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s in his brother’s restaurant. Let’s have a bowl of noodles together.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Nyuk Tsin and the pretty young girl went into Asia’s place and sat down, and in a moment Australia appeared and was astonished to see them, for Wu Chow’s Auntie had never before entered the place. He sat down with them, and Nyuk Tsin asked bluntly, “Don’t you think your brother’s wife’s sister is attractive?” Obviously, Australia did, and after a few minutes Nyuk Tsin found occasion to leave the table and talk with her son Asia, who said, “It’s disgraceful to bring a girl like that in here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the weeks that followed, Nyuk Tsin often asked Australia, “Why don’t you help your brother at the restaurant?” And whenever her only unmarried son did so, Nyuk Tsin managed to find Siu Han somewhere in Chinatown, and she would bring the two together, so that before the year was out it was not Wu Chow’s Auntie who was arguing with the wealthy Chings that they permit their only remaining daughter to marry Australia; it was the daughter herself who did all the talking. “My rascal girl,” Mrs. Ching called her. Nyuk Tsin prudently dropped out of the picture, and in early 1890 a marriage was announced.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the wedding Nyuk Tsin, then forty-three years old but looking closer to sixty, sat silent and thanked the Hakka gods that they had been so good to her; then her attention was attracted to a Hakka woman who had brought as a gift a small sandalwood box, carried from Canton, and as Nyuk Tsin smelled that aromatic present she thought: “This is indeed the Fragrant Tree Country.”</p>

  <p class="normal">By THE TIME the last decade of the nineteenth century opened, Wild Whip Hoxworth was concentrating his considerable energy on two prospects: women and making Hawaii part of the United States. For a while his performance in the former field was the more spectacular, for after his divorce from the Spanish woman Aloma Duarte he spent his free time with a strange assortment of creatures who could be counted upon to drift ashore from passing ships. They were women without faces, but with memorable bodies, and it was uncanny how as soon as they touched shore they made a direct line to Wild Whip, as if he had the capacity to send out messages that he could be found lolling on the porch of the Hawaiian Hotel. Quickly, these drifting women moved their luggage-- they never had much--into the rooms Whip occupied and after a while each moved along to Manila or Hong Kong. Many would have enjoyed staying, but Whip was too smart to allow that. From time to time he spent his weekends in Rat Alley, across the river in Iwilei, and one of the most common sights at the Hawaiian Hotel, built by the king for the entertainment of important guests, was the deferential appearance of some Chinese brothel keeper with news for Whip that a new girl had come in or that an old one wished particularly to see him. It was understandable that women liked Whip, for at thirty-three he was tall and lean, with knife scars across his left cheek and black hair that rumpled in the wind. He had flashing white teeth and slow, penetrating eyes. He was careful of his appearance, and when he rode horseback along the dusty roads of his sugar plantations, he could speak to his hands in masterful pidgin, with appropriate touches of Chinese, Japanese, Hawaiian or Portuguese to fit the individual workman with whom he talked, but for all sentences, regardless of language, he adopted the lilting accent brought to the islands by Mexican cowboys, so that each statement ended with an upward song: “Eh, you Joe! What you theenk? You holo holo watah?” The words think and water were heavily accented and given an ingratiating melody. While his men were in the fields, tending the cane, Wild Whip often stopped by their homes to talk with their women, and it naturally happened that occasionally these women would appreciate his courtly manners and he found great pleasure in suddenly leaping into bed with them and having a wild few minutes, after which he called, as he rode off, “Eh, you Rosie, ne? Take care you boy he come home, he one fine man I theenk.” Twice he had been slashed at with machetes, and when he reflected upon that occupational hazard he supposed that some day he would die in a scene of wild brutality and the sanctimonious newspapers of the islands would scream the scandal, and at the prospect he laughed, thinking: “What a great way to die!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, in late 1892, Wild Whip became galvanized into even wilder action in a completely different arena, for the United States was beginning to show signs of once more discriminating against the importation of Hawaiian sugar. The great planters of cane in Louisiana were determined to end the reciprocity arrangements whereby Hawaii sent sugar to the mainland tax-free while the United States was allowed to send certain goods into Hawaii and also to use Pearl Harbor as a naval base. Cried the Louisiana sugar men: “We don’t need their sugar and we don’t need Pearl Harbor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For thirty years the New Orleans sugar tycoons had been waging war against Hawaii, and they had managed to hold the profits of Hawaiian planters like Wild Whip Hoxworth to reasonable limits, but they had failed to kill off the industry. Now a new factor had entered the battle against Hawaii: the huge western states of Colorado and Nebraska were beginning to grow beets and to grind them into sugar, and they, too, wanted to destroy Hawaiian competition. Within a few years it was likely that a coalition of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Colorado and Nebraska, plus such new states as Wyoming and Utah, would form to drive Hawaiian sugar forever out of the market, and when this happened sugar planters like Wild Whip would see their massive fortunes begin to vanish.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In sugar, there’s only one rule,” Whip told the sugar planters he had assembled. “Either we sell to the United States, or we don’t sell. Our sole aim must be to protect that market.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re losing it,” John Janders pointed out. “Right now I represent eleven of your major sugar plantations, and with the way those bastards from Louisiana and Colorado are trying to strangle us, I can see nine of your eleven outfits going into bankruptcy. One more serious cut in our American market, and I don’t know what we’ll do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Excuse me, John,” Whip interrupted. “You’re right in what you say, but I’m afraid you’re mincing words. I happen to have the figures, and by God, nobody can listen to these without panic. Since the McKinley Tariff every damned sugar man in Louisiana and Colorado has been getting a subsidy of two cents a pound, whereas sugar imported from Hawaii has been penalized. What’s it all mean? During the first twelve months of this McKinley abortion our profits have dropped five million dollars. I don’t mean the profits of Hawaii. I mean the profits of the nine men sitting in this room. Now as to the actual invested value of our plantations, they’ve lost twelve million dollars. And it’s going to get worse and worse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He paused to allow discussion of the peril in which the Hawaiian sugar men found themselves, for up to the moment of this meeting, the great planters had known they were in danger but no one had had the courage to accumulate the depressing figures; now under Whip’s lashing they had to face facts. Companies were going to go bankrupt and men were going to lose plantations their fathers had built.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you think we should do?” John Janders asked. He was a year older than Whip and eight centuries more conservative.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip parried the question and observed, “Obviously, John, unless we do something we’re going to lose Hawaii. It’s going to subside into the barren, useless batch of islands it was in 1840.” There was a hush, and Whip continued: “Those aren’t just words, either. Two more bad years, John, and you’ll be bankrupt. Absolutely pau. Dave Hale may be able to hold out a little longer, but Harry Hewlett can’t.” Then he thumped himself in the chest and added, “I’m good for eighteen months, and then I’m bankrupt. Gentlemen, I don’t propose to go bankrupt.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a sober group of Hales, Hewletts and Janderses who listened to these gloomy but accurate words. Finally Dave Hale asked, “How you going to escape, Whip?”</p>

  <p class="normal">With carefully studied words Whip replied, “I’ve asked that the doors be closed, gentlemen, because what you and I are about to do is ugly work, so if any of you have weak kidneys I’ll give you time to go out and take a piss right now. And don’t bother to come back.” He waited in silence and could see that the sugar men were breathing hard. “I’ll give you two more minutes,” he said, “and after that, there’s no turning back.” He put his watch on the table, and when the seconds had passed he said simply, “Gentlemen, we are now duly constituted as the Committee of Nine and no one here must have any illusions. This afternoon I want you quietly to buy up all the available guns in Honolulu.” He put his left hand to his chin and with his thumb rubbed the scar that crossed his face like jagged lightning. When the shock of his first command had been absorbed he added, “Yes, we’re going to launch a revolution, win control of these islands, and turn them over to the United States. Once we’ve done that, Louisiana and Colorado can go to hell. They’ll be powerless to destroy us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think the United States will accept us?” Dave Hale asked timorously.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip dropped both hands on the table and said harshly, “Gentlemen, the days ahead are going to be damned difficult. But there is one thing we must never doubt. The United States is going to accept Hawaii.” He thundered his fists on the table and repeated, “We are going to be part of America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How . . .” Dave Hale began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know how!” Whip interrupted. “But we’re going to join America and we’re going to make all the goddamned money growing sugar that we want to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">John Janders spoke quickly: “Whip, you know I’m even stronger for sugar than you are, because I’ve got more to lose. But take my advice on one thing. Don’t organize this revolution around sugar. Among ourselves, here in the committee, all right. But don’t let the outside world know. For them you’ve got to have an idea bigger than sugar.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Young Hale added, “John’s right. The big American newspapers will never support us if our revolution is built on sugar.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the Hewlett boys, who owned the biggest sugar plantation of all, suggested: “Somehow we’ve got to work in the word democracy. Red-blooded Americans on these islands are sick of living under a corrupt monarchy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s it!” John Janders cried. “Something the American Congress can get hold of. American citizens yearning to be free.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip smiled at his associates. “You fellows have a lot of sense. I agree with you that if we stand forth as a sugar revolution, the bastards in Louisiana and Colorado would crucify us. I can hear them now, bleeding for the monarchy. But I have a better idea, gentlemen. You and I are going to start this revolution, and we’re going to direct it, and when everyone else gets scared, we’re going to fire the guns. But,” and he paused for effect, “not one of us is going to appear before the public.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who will?” Dave Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll get the lawyers who handle our plantation affairs, and the newspaper people and some schoolteachers and a couple of ministers,” Whip snapped. “This is going to be the most respectable revolution in history. You’re going to hear more high-flown sentiments than you thought existed, because I’ve decided on the ideal man to stand before the public.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who you thinking of?” Hale probed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip looked directly at the young man and said, “Your Uncle Micah.”</p>

  <p class="normal">David Hale gasped and said, “He’ll never revolt against the monarchy. He’s a citizen of Hawaii and takes it very seriously.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re all citizens of Hawaii,” Whip replied, “and we all take it seriously. That’s why we’re going to save these islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Uncle Micah’s been an adviser to the crown, a personal friend of all the kings. He’s an ordained minister . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For those very reasons we’ve got to have him,” Whip interrupted. “He won’t support us willingly. He’ll preach against us, and he’ll despise our revolution, but the force of circumstance will make him our leader. Believe me, it’ll be Uncle Micah Hale with his long white beard who will send the final letter to President Harrison: Hawaii is yours.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point John Janders threw some very cold water upon the revolution: “I got a letter from Washington which said that everyone there thinks Grover Cleveland will be elected again this year.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the mention of this portly, strong-willed Democrat, the Committee of Nine grew glum, for in his previous administration Cleveland had delivered several staggering blows against Hawaiian sugar and it was likely that he would do so again; but more important, the idealistic reformer had come out strongly against the spirit of manifest destiny then popular in America. “The United States wants no empire,” Cleveland had proclaimed, and it was the shadow of this great bulk that fell across the incipient revolution. But not even Grover Cleveland frightened Wild Whip Hoxworth: “To hell with his mealy-mouthed nonsense about international morality. We’ll start the revolution right away. Wind it up fast. And have Uncle Micah throw the islands to Harrison before the next election is held. By the time Cleveland’s President, we’ll be part of America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can we do it in the time available?” one of the Hewlett boys asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If we work,” Whip replied. The Committee of Nine broke up their first meeting and each man took upon himself three jobs: buy all available guns; find respectable citizens to stand before the public as front men of the revolution; and test every friend to see who could be depended upon to help overthrow the Hawaiian monarchy. When the frightened, but determined, sugar planters were gone, Whip Hoxworth was left with the most difficult job of all. He had to find some way of making white-bearded, righteous old Micah Hale assume leadership of the revolt.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not a strong monarchy to begin with. In 1872 the great Kamehameha line had ended in sickness and frustration, to be followed by a succession of amiable but incompetent alii. One had sought to revive paganism as the consolidating force of Hawaiian life; another had tried to abrogate the constitution and take Hawaii back to an absolute monarchy unrestrained by any middle-class legislature; there had been palace revolutions, the election of kings according to their personal popularity, and a shocking scandal in which one king was caught trying to peddle an opium concession twice over to two different Chinese gamblers. This sad decline of the Hawaiian state had caused deep concern among the missionary families, and although some men of rectitude like Micah Hale loyally supported the royal line, they were grieved when attempts were made to legalize opium and lotteries.</p>

  <p class="normal">Even so, had the customary succession of amiable and handsome kings continued and had they allowed their iron-willed New England advisers to run the kingdom, Micah Hale and his responsible associates would probably have been able to keep the tottering monarchy viable; but on January 29, 1891, royalty of a far different sort ascended the throne and trouble was inescapable. Queen Liliuokalani was a short, moderately stout woman of regal bearing. She had large, determined lips, a high pile of graying hair, and wrists laden with jewels. In black satin fringed with ostrich feathers and bearing a feathered ivory fan, she was an imposing woman with a stubborn will. It was her custom to deliver important messages seated in front of a golden-yellow cape of feathers, both because this was an antique royal custom which set off her dignity and because she was slightly crippled and did not move with grace. For many years she had been plain Lydia Dominis, strong-minded wife of a slim haole of Italian descent, with whom she lived in a large white mansion called Washington Place. Upon the death of her brother, the king, she ascended the throne, bringing with her a desire to reverse the trend toward haole domination and a determination to cast aside New England influences like Micah Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was a highly intelligent woman and had traveled to the courts of Europe, where the role played by Queen Victoria impressed her, and she had a love of political power. Had she acquired the throne immediately after the passing of the Kamehameha, she might have made Hawaii a strong and secure monarchy, for she had a lively imagination and much skill in manipulating people; but she attained ultimate power too late; republicanism had infected her people; sugar had captured her islands. And although she did not know it, her enemy was no longer the stately political leader Micah Hale; it was the gun-running, determined plantation owner Wild Whip Hoxworth. Against the former she might have had a chance; against the latter she was powerless.</p>

  <p class="normal">Without ever identifying her enemies, this headstrong, imaginative woman tried to combat republicanism, Congregationalism and sugar, but she succeeded only in driving those disparate forces together in a coalition. Hawaiians who were tired of the monarchy and its silly pretensions conspired against the queen, although most who joined the coalition did so in hope of currying favor with the Americans. Missionary families came out boldly against the corruption, absolutism and paganism of the monarchy, but many who cried loudest in public against these evils also owned businesses that would prosper under American rule. And lawyers were forceful in their arguments against the excesses of the monarchy and in defense of human rights, but mostly they fought to protect sugar. As the queen’s obstinate reign continued, the coalition against her became more powerful.</p>

  <p class="normal">In early 1893 the headstrong woman determined to eliminate the influence of men like the statesman Micah Hale and his insolent nephew Whip Hoxworth. Accordingly, she let it be known that she intended to abrogate the present constitution, which hampered her absolute power, to put the legislature under royal control, and to revoke the voting rights of many citizens and generally restore the ancient prerogatives of the monarchy. She was a notable figure when she made this disclosure: queenly, posed against yellow feathers dating back two hundred years, a lei of plumeria about her shoulders and a train of satin four feet long piled about her crippled foot. As she spoke she did not make it clear, but it was her intention to take Hawaii back to the good old days that France had enjoyed in 1620.</p>

  <p class="normal">That afternoon Wild Whip Hoxworth summoned the Committee of Nine, and his conspirators convened in an upper room of Janders &amp; Whipple on Merchant Street, an earlier proposal that the members meet at Hoxworth &amp; Hale having been vetoed because of the fear that Micah Hale, still stoutly attached to the monarchy, might hear of the plot. Wild Whip was concise in his opening statement: “Our headstrong queen is to be congratulated. Her silly acts have made revolution obligatory.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hewlett boys were fearful of overt action and counseled caution, but straightforward John Janders said gruffly, “We’ve to overthrow the monarchy in the next two days or lose our opportunity to capture the government.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you mean to incite a bloody revolution?” David Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If necessary,” Janders replied, and no further vote was taken.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then it’s revolution!” Whip Hoxworth announced, issuing a statement rather than a question. The committee cheered, and Whip said, “Our plan must be to strike quickly and to gain control of all the main points in the city.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What about the other islands?” one of the Hales asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To hell with the other islands,” Hoxworth snapped. “The post office, the banks, the palace, the armory. We win them and we control Honolulu. Win Honolulu and we have Hawaii. Janders, tell the committee what you learned today.”</p>

  <p class="normal">John Janders rose, coughed, and spoke formally: “This morning I had a two-hour talk with the American Minister, and we studied the law with great care. It is quite clear, he advised me, that if the revolution quickly acquires control of the major points in Honolulu, so that an observer could logically say, ‘the committee controls the city,’ the United States will have sufficient cause to contend that we are the de facto government. The Minister will promptly recognize us. The monarchy will be at an end. And we will be on our way to incorporation within the United States.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what about the American troops in the harbor?” one of the Hewlett boys asked. “Will the ship captains send their troops ashore to fight against us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">A broad smile came over the scarred face of Wild Whip as he lounged at the head of the table. The committee looked at him, satisfied that he had uncovered some trick for neutralizing the American forces, but he did not divulge the plan. “Tell them what we arranged, John,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Burly John Janders explained: “We have entered into a solemn agreement with the American Minister and with the ship captains that as soon as we start the revolution, they will send ashore the maximum number of troops. Their orders will be simple: ‘Protect American lives.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we’re Hawaiian citizens,” David Hale protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re also Americans,” Janders replied blandly, “and we’re the Americans who are going to be protected.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Fighting back a sardonic smile, Whip leaned forward across the table and said, “It’s a plan that can’t fail. We launch our drive against the ten key targets. Immediately fighting begins, American troops storm ashore. What can the Hawaiians think? They’ll reason, ‘The American troops have come to fight against the queen!’ So they’ll throw down their arms and we’ll capture the ten key spots. And as soon as we control them the American Minister will announce: ‘The United States formally recognizes the de facto government.’ At that moment what in hell can the queen do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">John Janders cried, “How can we lose?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Soberly David Hale pointed out, “We can lose easily … if Uncle Micah appeals to the world powers against our revolution.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He will not do so,” Whip promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s a man of great honor,” Hale insisted. “And he’s sworn allegiance to Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s my job to get Uncle Micah on our side,” Whip said flatly. “He’ll be there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hewlett boys consulted, and one said, “We’ll leave the revolution unless we can depend on Micah Hale to represent us before the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He will be with us,” Whip promised. “Not in the fighting. He’s too old a man for that. But when it’s over, he’ll step forth as our leader.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can we depend on this?” the Hewlett boys asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip leaped up and crashed his chair aside. “Goddamn it!” he yelled. “If our whole success depends on Micah Hale, do you suppose I’m going to let him escape? Of course you can depend upon it. He’ll be with us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Janders spoke: “Whip’s got to take care of that. We’ve got to stir up public enthusiasm for the revolution. What we need is a big mass meeting on Monday. Lots of speeches about human decency and men’s inalienable rights.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I don’t want to see any of this committee making speeches,” Whip warned. “Get some of the lawyers and men like Cousin Ed Hewlett. He’s part-Hawaiian and rants well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Things seemed to be going so well that the Committee of Nine-- that is, eight of them--began to relax: the revolution was at hand; the ten key spots were invested; the American Minister had recognized the new government; President Harrison had accepted it as part of the Union; and sugar was more profitable than ever. But Wild Whip brought the conspirators back to reality, pointing out in icy tones: “At the mass meeting on Monday I want everyone to be within quick reach of his guns.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will there be trouble?” one of the Hewletts asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not if we’re ready for it,” Whip replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the others quietly left the cellar and circulated through the agitated city, dropping ideas here and there, Wild Whip walked eastward on King Street toward the Hale mansion across from the palace, and when he reached the white picket fence and the wide green lawns in which Malama Hale took such pride, he nodded graciously to that stately half-Hawaiian lady and asked, “Is Uncle Micah in?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s in his study,” Malama said gently.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip entered without knocking, and before he spoke he closed the door. His uncle was surrounded by his father’s missionary books, brought over from Lahaina, and by a substantial theological and legal library. As principal adviser to four kings he had been required to give many legal opinions, and his fine mind found pleasure in doing so. From the 1870’s on he had paid little attention to the ventures of H &amp; H, leaving that to the Hoxworths and his nephews; he had gladly accepted his proper share of the firm’s enormous profits and had applied his income to the betterment of Hawaii. The Missionary Home for Lepers at Kalaupapa, the library, Punahou and the church had benefited from his charities, but mainly he had spent his income on helping to run the government efficiently. When one of the kings took a grand tour around the world, stopping off in most of the major capitals, it was Micah Hale who accompanied him at his own expense and who paid for many of the essentials. Most of the legal books owned by the cabinet were also purchased by Micah, for he constantly harangued his contemporaries: “We are all of mission extraction, and until Hawaii is completely stable, the job of our fathers is not completed.” No island throughout the Pacific ever had a better public servant than Micah Hale, for if he was liberal with his money, he was thrice generous with his energy. Of the fine laws that were often cited in Europe to prove that Hawaii was civilized, an astonishing proportion had sprung from his energetic mind; and what was remarkable in that period was his capacity to rise above personal interest: any laws passed in his regime that favored either sugar planters or shippers were proposed not by him but by the Janderses, the Whipples and the Hewletts who proliferated in the government. Four kings had thought of Micah Hale as their one trustworthy American adviser, yet each had known that he favored the ultimate submission of Hawaii to the United States, The present queen knew of his stand, and it had irritated her and she had dismissed him from all of his offices. He was seventy years old, of better than medium height, stately in bearing and with a long, spadelike white beard. He dressed only in white, including white-powdered shoes, and in public refused to wear glasses. This was the man that faced Whip Hoxworth on the night of Saturday, January 14, 1893.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Uncle Micah,” Whip began forthrightly, refusing the chair offered him, “there’s bound to be a revolution within the next two days.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you fomented it?” the spare old man asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir, I have. And the Hale boys and the Hewletts and Janderses. The Whipples have also joined us and my brother. There can be no retreat.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah leaned back in his office chair and studied his nephew. “So there’s going to be a revolution?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir.” Whip was accustomed to addressing older people in the style he had been taught aboard the whaler.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How old are you, Whip?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thirty-six.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many wives have you had?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many knife battles in Iwilei?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Twenty, thirty.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many illegitimate children?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m supporting half a dozen or more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know what they call you around town, Whip?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wild Whip. They call me that to my face. I don’t care.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wasn’t thinking about what they call you to your face. I was thinking of the other name.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What other name?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Golden Stud. That’s how you’re known, Whip. And you consider yourself qualified to step forth as the leader of a commune dedicated to the overthrow of a duly constituted government?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, sir, Uncle Micah, I don’t.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought you said your group was plotting the revolution.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are. And I’m directing it. And when I say, ‘Fire,’ by God, sir, we’ll fire. So don’t be in the way. And I’m well qualified to direct a revolution, Uncle Micah, because there’s nothing on this earth I fear, and within two days I’ll have a new government in Hawaii. But I am not qualified to step forth as the public leader of the revolution. You’re right on that, and I know it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is to be the leader?”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are.” As Micah gasped at this suggestion, Whip sat down.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two men, so unalike, stared at each other, and each sensed the tremendous New England force of the other. Micah Hale lived by a code of fierce rectitude and he persuaded those who associated with him to do the same, while Whip Hoxworth had never outgrown the brawling fo’c’sls of the Pacific. He knew that all men were swine and that they enjoyed being kicked into line; yet on the eve of the revolution he also knew that certain focal points of history required a man better than himself to stand forth as leader. There were limits to what even Whipple Hoxworth could attain without the assistance of decency.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is pretty much a sugar revolution, isn’t it, Whipple?” Micah asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“From my point of view, yes, sir. From yours, no, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can there be two interpretations of an evil act, Whipple?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If there weren’t two interpretations of our necessary act, Uncle Micah, I wouldn’t be here pleading with you. I want a revolution so that sugar will be forever made safe in these islands. You want it so that the islands can join the United States in accordance with a destiny that you foresaw fifty years ago. Uncle Micah, you’ve always been right, and you are tonight. Hawaii is doomed unless it contrives some trick to make America accept these islands. And I control that trick. Sir, the only way your dream will ever be realized is through me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not so, Whipple. The day will come when Washington will see the inevitability of annexation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never! Only actions make things inevitable.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Justice and dawning conscience produce inevitability. Slowly, Washington will see what the right step is. And we must rely upon Washington to take it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! If you live to be a hundred, you’ll die talking about the slow inevitability of justice. There’s going to be a revolution, my revolution, and you’re going to lead it so that your dream of justice can come true.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah Hale rose slowly and stared down at his vigorous young nephew. “I am appalled, Whipple, that you so misjudge me as to think that I would be partner to such an evil action. I will not divulge your plans, although I should. But now you had better go.” To his surprise, his scar-faced nephew did not rise. Insolently he kept his position, raised one foot to kick his uncle’s chair into place, and said, “Now we understand each other. Sit down, Uncle Micah, and let’s talk about revolution. Let’s forget everything we’ve said so far. And you might as well forget about threatening to divulge our plans to the government. Charley Wilson knows about them and wanted to arrest us all but the cabinet didn’t have the guts to back him up. So let’s see what you and I can do for one another. You despise my position and I think yours is pathetic. Okay, let’s not revert to that again. Uncle Micah, there’s going to be a revolution in two days. You can’t possibly stop it. We’ve got the American Minister waiting on the edge of his chair to recognize our de facto government. We’ve got American troops out there in the harbor just itching to swarm ashore and protect decent Americans against Hawaiian savages. We’ve got our targets pinpointed and our schedules laid. Even if you were to inform the queen herself, you’d only move up the timetable by the hours you stole from us.” He leaned forward and looked hard into his uncle’s eyes. “It’s a revolution, Uncle Micah.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah Hale was not the kind of man to find his lips going dry at moments of crisis. He had weathered too many abortive revolutions when only his courage had saved the government from irresponsible outrage, and he did not sense any unusual quickening of his pulse now. With eyes as hard as his nephew’s, but from a different cause, he said, “You’ve thought of everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s accept the revolution as accomplished,” the young sugar planter proposed. “I’m not the man who ought to stand before the bar of world opinion and explain why it was necessary. My record wouldn’t read very well in London or Berlin. So let’s say my part of the revolution has been successful, and that all it represents is my personal greediness . . . sugar . . . land. What happens then? America won’t accept us. Maybe Japan would.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The idea that Wild Whip was developing had several other subsidiary clauses, but bearded old Micah Hale did not hear them, for with the mention of the word Japan he was suddenly transported to the mysterious city of Tokyo in the year 1881, when he served as privy councilor to the last king of Hawaii on the latter’s triumphal journey around the world. The royal party was stopping in a Japanese mansion that contained no chairs; the floors were of the most exquisite wood polished by centuries of use and the sliding doors were joyous to behold. It was March and a horde of busy gardeners scurried about pruning pine trees with gnarled red branches. A row of plum trees showed white blossoms, cherries were eager to burst into bloom, and as the first warm days of the year approached, the Hawaiian party relaxed to enjoy the gracious scenery.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly Micah had looked up and asked, “Where’s the king?” No one knew. At first there was excitement; then, as the hours passed, there was panic, on the part of both the Americans and the Japanese, for the King of Hawaii was clearly missing. No one had seen him leave the spacious grounds of the mansion and a frantic search revealed no betraying signs of foul play. He had vanished, a great hulk of a man dressed in conspicuous western clothes and a long black London-tailored coat. It was one of the few times that Micah Hale had experienced real dread, for he was aware that in relatively recent years Japanese samurai, outraged at the invasion of foreigners, had sliced off the heads of several. Consequently he knelt in the chairless room and prayed: “God, save the king! Please!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the third hour of panic, the king appeared, in jovial mood, holding his shoes. He had obviously been crawling through the stream that separated the mansion from the Imperial Palace, and he had obviously been having a rare time. He refused to explain where he had spent the missing three hours and he went to bed that night highly pleased with himself. In the morning the emperor’s chamber-kin waited until the king was occupied with other matters and then quietly slipped in to see Micah.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Utterly extraordinary,” the little man in the shiny black London morning coat said in good English. “Yesterday afternoon we heard this strange noise at the Imperial Palace, and the guards were about to shoot an intruder when I saw that it was your king. He was barefooted, muddy, laughing. His great brown face was wet with perspiration when he pushed aside the shoji, walked with his dirty feet over the tatami and said, ‘I’d like to talk with the emperor.’ We were appalled, because nothing like this had ever happened before, but Mutsuhito is a superb man and he said, ‘I’d like to talk with you.’ And they went into Mutsuhito’s private audience chamber. And what is astonishing, they stayed there for nearly three hours.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah Hale wiped his forehead and straightened out his beard. “Believe me, Excellency, it was not I who sent the king.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hardly,” the chamberlain replied. “In view of what he talked about.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did he speak of?” Micah probed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you know?” the Japanese asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The king said, ‘Hawaii is tired of being pushed this way and that by America and England and Russia. It is a Pacific power and must remain so.’ ” The chamberlain paused for effect and it became apparent that Micah was expected to pursue the inquiry.</p>

  <p class="normal">Instead he relaxed, bowed to the chamberlain and said, “I am grateful to you for having looked after my king.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you a subject of his Majesty?” the Japanese asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. When I took service with the government, I swore allegiance to Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How interesting. Would you care to join me in a cup of English tea?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d be delighted,” Micah said. They walked through lovely pine-laden gardens and came to a small rustic house, where a serving-maid waited.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What your king proposed,” the Japanese said, afraid that Micah was not going to ask, “was that the heir to his throne, the Princess Kaiulani, be given in marriage to the son of the emperor, so as to bind Japan and Hawaii closer together.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah lost his aplomb. He choked on his tea, spilled it, slammed the cup down, and gasped, “What did you say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He proposed an alliance of mutual interest, to be sealed by the marriage of the princess to one of our princes. When I heard the facts, Mr. Hale, I choked, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two diplomats stared at each other, aghast. Finally Micah stammered, “What had I better do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’d better get the king out of Japan immediately.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course, of course. But I mean . . . with the emperor?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A formal offer of marriage has been extended. It’s got to be considered by the Imperial family . . . and the staff. In a year or so we’ll send an answer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Excellency, please take pains to insure that the answer is no.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is now beyond my control. How old is your princess?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let me see, she’s six.” “We have time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Micah completed plans to whisk his unpredictable king out of Japan, but as they sat at supper, the king still having said nothing concerning his impromptu visit with the emperor, Micah studied his fat, jolly face and thought: “I wonder what transpires in that surprising brain? How did he think up a state marriage with the Japanese royal family? Where did he get the idea for an alliance with Japan? Such a thing would destroy all hope of eventual union with America! My goodness, what can we expect him to do when he gets to Europe!” From that prophetic day, Micah Hale had appreciated the inherent danger that Hawaii might one day associate itself with Japan. He had therefore fought against the importation of Japanese farmers onto the sugar plantations, but greedy men like John Janders and the Hewlett boys had insisted upon it. He was frightened by the adroit manner in which the little Japanese, who had begun arriving in the 1880’s, accommodated themselves to Hawaiian life, and he had tried to pass laws forbidding them to leave the plantations and open stores. When alone with friends he often referred to the “Yellow Menace,” and he foresaw that the Japanese would multiply and grasp for political power in a way that the more easygoing Chinese never would. Therefore he had constructed an international-relations platform that had only two planks: “Make Hawaii American. Keep the Japanese away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Consequently, when Wild Whip uttered the phrase, “It begins to look as if Japan might . . .” vibrant chords were struck in Micah Hale’s memory. “What was that last point, Whip?” he asked his nephew.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was saying that if you want to see your basic dream come to pass, you can do it only through me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I mean about Japan,” Micah explained, and suddenly Whip realized that his uncle had heard nothing of his last statements. He had been daydreaming about some forgotten incident that Whip didn’t know about, but with sure instinct, Whip knew that his uncle’s reverie concerned Japan and that it had produced fear. He therefore decided to play upon that fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was saying about Japan, that there is a good deal of evidence that the Yellow Menace would be glad to take Hawaii if the United States doesn’t.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think so?” Micah asked fearfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What more natural?” Whip asked, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think Japan would extend herself so far from her own islands?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not by design, but if we don’t get Hawaii into the United States, she’ll have to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am terribly afraid of that,” Micah admitted. “And if not Japan, then England or Germany.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Obviously, if we allow the islands to lie around unwanted, someone will surely grab them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But suppose the monarchy cleansed itself,” Micah temporized. “Suppose we got rid of Liliuokalani and put somebody else on the throne?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip saw that his uncle was clutching at straws, so he hammered home his points: “The revolutionists will tolerate no Hawaiian monarch. None that you could propose, Uncle Micah, would be acceptable.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His nephew’s position startled the white-bearded old man and he said, “Then even though you are uncertain of what comes next, you’re determined to overthrow the monarchy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip was not to be trapped into such an admission of irresponsibility. Suavely he replied, “But we are certain of what comes next, Uncle Micah. You come next. You justify us before world opinion and lead us into the United States. It’s what you’ve always wanted. It’s what you know is right.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two men fell into silence, as Micah, a leader on whom all the glories and perquisites available to the kings of Hawaii had been visited, considered what he must do. He was caught in wild currents of confusion, and any antagonist other than Wild Whip Hoxworth would have retired at this moment and allowed his uncle to study the matter through the remainder of the night, but now the mark of Whip’s character stood out. He rose from his chair, went to the door, stretched as if he were leaving, looked out at the stars dancing over Diamond Head and turned back toward his uncle. Lifting a chair and placing it so that its back faced Micah, he sat with his arms folded across the top of the back and his legs straddling the seat. This brought his scarred face close to his uncle’s, and he said coldly, “Uncle Micah, so far we’ve been sparring. Now we’ve got to get down to the bedrock base of this revolution. There’s no escape. You’ve got to stand before the public.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “I cannot betray the Hawaiians who have befriended me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “But you’re ready to betray the Americans who own these islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “When I took my oath of allegiance to Hawaii, I believed what I was doing. I became a Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “I didn’t. I remained an American. I’m going to call on American warships to protect my property for me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “You can act that way. I can’t.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “That is not the action we’re talking about, Uncle Micah. I’m saying that I am determined to lead a revolution against a weak and corrupt form of government. I’m going to win my part of the revolution. But only you can carry it to its logical conclusion: union with America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “And that I refuse to do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “If you shared your stubborn conclusion with the silly queen, she’d applaud. But if you told Aunt Malama how you were wasting the tides of history and allowing them to slip away from you, even though she’s a Hawaiian she’d say you were stupid.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “I cannot betray these good people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “Then you will allow the forces of history to betray them to Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “That’s a risk we’ll have to take.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “It’s not a risk, Uncle Micah. It’s a certainty. These islands are doomed. There is only one way to save them. Pick up our revolution and lead it to a good end.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “I will not prostitute myself to protect a gang of sugar robbers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “Unless you protect us, every good thing you have ever wanted for Hawaii will be lost.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “I would relinquish even Union with America rather than attain it as a result of unchristian acts.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “I am surprised you speak of Christianity. Are you willing to abandon these islands to opium, lotteries, debauchery, with streets unsafe for women?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “These are problems we must solve within the framework of established government, not by revolution.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “Where was the framework of your established government when the late king used to convene his Ball of String Society?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “That was an aberration. God has surely punished him for that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “It was the mark of the monarchy. The old fool stood facing a crowd of beautiful women and threw a ball of string at them. He held one end and the girl who caught the ball followed him obediently to bed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “I hardly expected you to preach morality.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “I’ll preach anything that will end the monarchy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “The one evil thing I did in my life was to ally myself with your grandfather against my own father. God has never forgiven me for this, and I often wake at night in dreadful sweat and lie there for hours reflecting upon the devilish compact I made with Captain Hoxworth. Now you ask me to make a worse with his grandson. I can’t risk any more sleepless nights, Whipple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “The alliance between you and old Rafer Hoxworth may have been unholy in its inception. But look at the good it’s done Hawaii. The building, the jobs, the ships, the fields. Somebody had to accomplish those things, Uncle Micah. Your influence in doing them the right way was fundamental. Now you have got to ally yourself with me to insure a proper culmination to our revolt.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “Must a good man always use such evil instruments as you and your grandfather?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “Yes. Because good men never have the courage to act. You can only direct and safeguard movements already set into motion by men like me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah replied: “I will not compound the evil I did once. I will not help you, Whip.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip said: “You do not hurt me, Uncle Micah, but you destroy the future of these islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He bowed and left his austere uncle. It was nearly three in the morning when he walked down the path to King Street, and his last view of Micah was of the white-bearded old man sitting erect at his desk, staring at his books.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the secret meeting of the committee held the next day, Sunday, January 15, Wild Whip reported frankly to his conspirators: “Uncle Micah will not join us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then I can’t either,” said David Hale. Two of the Hewletts also withdrew.</p>

  <p class="normal">John Janders suggested: “We’d better not try to force the revolution. If Micah Hale’s against it, he might inflame public opinion against us. Then we’d be lost. I’m going to call off tomorrow’s mass meeting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a buzz of excitement and Wild Whip could feel the resolve of the would-be revolutionists ebbing away like the surf after a high tide. Men in groups were discussing how, having just coached Ed Hewlett in what to tell the mob tomorrow, they must now cancel his oratory.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You may have misunderstood me,” Whip said quietly. The revolutionists stopped retreating, eager to hear any words of direction. “I meant to say that Uncle Micah will not join us willingly. What I didn’t say was that I shall force his hand, and make him join. Everything goes ahead as planned. In two days, gentlemen, Hawaii will be a republic, and the men in this room will govern it. With Micah Hale as our face to the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you propose accomplishing that?” one of the Hales asked. “If Uncle Micah makes up his mind . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your uncle is a patriot,” Whip replied. “He loves Hawaii and is loyal to it. He will never see these islands disintegrate into formless revolution. He’ll be with us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How will you force his hand?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think we can get the American troops to march ashore tomorrow night . . . just after the mass meeting. This will accomplish two ends. It will encourage our side and scare hell out of the monarchists. We occupy the government buildings, throw the queen out, and on Monday morning Micah Hale will have to join us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you certain of this?” one of the trembling Hales asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to begin drafting the proclamations now,” Whip replied, “for him to sign, and I want David Hale and Micah Whipple to help me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The revolution that overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and passed the government into the hands of the sugar planters was under way. In her palace, the wild-willed queen shuddered as she saw American troops file ashore to invade her territory. She was disposed to fight them, for she knew that this was a cruel perversion of the ordinary relationships between sovereign nations, but the sugar planters quickly immobilized her loyal troops, and she was left defenseless, a stubborn, anachronistic woman in her mid-fifties, regal in appearance but totally unaware that the nineteenth century was ebbing to a close and taking with it the concepts of government to which she adhered.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, in the dying moments of her reign she was not completely without support, for after her troops were disbanded without firing a shot, a squad of volunteer loyalists materialized from the alleys of Honolulu and marched out to defend their queen. In their ranks, and typical of their quality, waddled the old kanaka maile gatherer, Kimo. He had a musket that he had grabbed from a man in a pool hall and he held his uniform—a pair of sagging pants and that was all—about his waist with a length of red rope. His hair had not been combed for some days, he needed a shave and he was barefooted, but like his companions he gave every evidence of being willing to die for his queen. The sparkling American troops with new rifles watched in amazement as the volunteers marched up to give them battle, but a courageous officer in whites ran unarmed to the leader of the irregulars and said, “There’s no war. The queen has abdicated.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s what?” the leader of the loyalists asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s abdicated,” the young American said. Then he shouted, “Anybody here speak Hawaiian?”</p>

  <p class="normal">A haole bystander idled up and asked, “What you want, General?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell these men that there is to be no war. The queen has abdicated.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure,” the haole agreed. Turning to Kimo and his men he said, “Eh, you kanaka! Liliuokalani pau. She go home. You pau too. You go home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And so far as the actual fighting was concerned, in this manner the revolution ended. Kimo trundled his unused musket back to the poolroom and listened to the gibes of his friends. Then in great disturbance of spirit, for he knew that he had participated in the death of a world he had loved—the horses prancing in gold tassels, the royal guard marching in bright uniforms, the queen going forth in a gilt carriage—he walked slowly down Beretania Street and up Nuuanu to the small house where he lived with his wife Apikela and his Chinese family. He went directly to bed and lay there without talking or laughing until he died.</p>

  <p class="normal">The provisional government, with Micah Hale as ostensible head and the sugar planters directing from behind, swept away the seventeenth-century anachronisms proposed by Queen Liliuokalani. Each act of the efficient new government was directed toward one clear goal: union with America. David Hale and Micah Whipple were rushed to Washington to force a Treaty of Annexation through the Senate before congenial President Harrison and his Republicans left office on March 4, because it was known that the newly elected 1 President, Grover Cleveland, opposed what had been happening in Hawaii; and soon frantic appeals for moral support were speeding back to Honolulu, for the treaty commissioners Hale and Whipple reported: “There is considerable opposition to the manner in which the revolution was carried out. Cannot Micah Hale make a strong statement, relaying upon his faultless reputation to give it force? Else we are lost.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was under these circumstances, in February, 1893, that Micah Hale retired to his study on King Street and wrote for a New York journal: “Any sane man looking at these islands today has got to admit that they require supervision by the United States of America. The indigenous citizens are for the most part illiterate, steeped in idolatry, committed to vain shows of monarchial display and totally unsuited to govern themselves.” In these harsh but true words, the son of a missionary, in his seventy-first year, summarized what his group had accomplished; but since he wrote as a profound patriot and as one who loved Hawaii above else, he did not understand what he was saying. Furthermore, he went on to point out a great truth that others both in Hawaii and America were overlooking: “Hawaii cannot lie idle and unwanted in the middle of the Pacific. The islands seem to lie close to America, but they also lie close to Canada and on the route from that great land to Australia and New Zealand. There is every reason for Hawaii to become Canadian. They also lie close to Russia-in-Asia and except for an accident of history might even now belong to that great power. And to anyone who has sailed from Honolulu to Yokohama or to Shanghai, these islands lie perilously close to Japan and China. For more than half a century I have believed that their destiny lies with America, but it is not as I once thought an inevitable destiny. If at this crucial moment of history, our logical destiny is frustrated, an illogical one will triumph and Hawaii, the gem of the Pacific, will belong to Canada or to Russia or to Japan. It is to prevent such a catastrophe that we pray for the United States to accept us now.” This widely reprinted article was taken from the Hale mansion on King Street by Wild Whip Hoxworth and delivered to one of his ships waiting in the harbor, but as old Micah Hale handed it to his nephew, he was freshly appalled that he should be using such an evil agent to accomplish so good a purpose.</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah’s plea achieved nothing, for Louisiana and Colorado sugar interests prevented the lame-duck Senate of February, 1893, from jamming the Treaty of Annexation through, and five days after Grover Cleveland assumed the Presidency he sternly withdrew the treaty and rebuked those who had sought to foist it upon the American public. Now doleful news reached Hawaii. The Secretary of State wrote: “The United States will not accept the Hawaiian Islands on the terms under which they have been offered. It would lower our national standard to endorse a selfish and dishonorable scheme of a lot of adventurers. I oppose taking these islands by force and fraud, for there is such a thing as international morality.”</p>

  <p class="normal">President Cleveland was of a similar opinion and personally dispatched an investigator to Honolulu to inquire into America’s role in the unsavory revolution, and by one of the tricks of history the investigator turned out to be a Democrat from Georgia and a member of a family that had once held slaves. When preliminary news of his appointment reached Hawaii, the Committee of Nine were apprehensive lest he report against them, but when his slave-holding status was revealed, they sighed with visible relief. “As a good Southerner he’ll understand our problems,” John Janders told the conspirators, and they all agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Whip Hoxworth, considering the matter carefully, judged: “We may be in for deep trouble. Since Cleveland’s investigator comes from Georgia, he probably despises niggers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course he does,” Janders agreed. “He’ll see through these Hawaiians right away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I doubt it,” Whip cautioned. “Granted that he hates niggers. As a sensible human being he’ll try to compensate and prove that he doesn’t hate other people with dark skins.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why would he do that?” Janders demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t ask me why!” Whip replied. “Just watch.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And when the investigator arrived he did exactly as Whip had predicted. Hating Negroes at home, he had to like Hawaiians abroad. It was a profound compulsion and it permitted him, a Georgia man, to understand the revolution better than any other American understood it at the time. He talked principally with Hawaiians, was bedazzled by the idea of speaking directly with a queen, became an ardent royalist, and suppressed evidence given by white men. His report to President Cleveland was a crushing rebuke to the sugar men; they had, he discovered, conspired with the American Minister to overthrow a duly constituted government; they had worked in league with the captain of an American vessel; they had deposed the queen against the will of the Hawaiian people; they had done all this for personal gain; and it was his opinion that Queen Liliuokalani, a virtuous woman, should be restored to her throne.</p>

  <p class="normal">His report aroused such a storm in Washington that David Hale and Micah Whipple saw there was no hope of forcing the United States to accept Hawaii, and they returned to Honolulu with the glum prediction: “We will never become part of America while Grover Cleveland is President. His Secretary of State is already asking, ‘Should not the great wrong done to a feeble state by an abuse of the authority of the United States be undone by restoring the legitimate government?’ There’s even talk of restoring the queen by force of American arms.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What would happen to us?” members of the Committee asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Since you’re American subjects,” a consular official explained, “you’d be arrested, hauled off to Washington, and tried for conspiring to overthrow a friendly power.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“On, no!” the conspirators protested. “We’re Hawaiian subjects. Our citizenship is here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">September and October, 1893, were uneasy months in Hawaii, and Wild Whip’s gang maintained power by only a nervous margin. Each arriving ship brought ominous news from Washington, where sentiment had swung strongly in favor of Queen Liliuokalani, and it was generally assumed that she would shortly be restored to power; but just before this was about to occur the obstinate woman committed an act so appalling to the Americans that she forever discredited the monarchy. What Wild Whip had been unable to gain for himself, the queen won for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Late in the year President Cleveland dispatched a second investigator to check upon the specific terms under which Liliuokalani should be returned to her throne, for as Cleveland pointed out, America never wished to profit from the misfortunes of her neighbors. The new investigator plunged the Committee of Nine into despair by announcing that the annexation of Hawaii by America was no longer even under discussion, whereupon he entered into formal discussions with the queen as to what steps she wanted America to take in restoring her crown.</p>

  <p class="normal">No difficulties were encountered, and the investigator had to smile when the queen pointed out, “One of the charges made against us most often, sir, was that we were a small kingdom overly given to a love of luxurious display. To this charge I must plead guilty, because from the first our kings selected as their advisers men of the missionary group, and we found that no men on earth love panoply and richly caparisoned horses and bright uniforms and medals more than men who have long been dressed in New England homespun. I have four pictures here of state occasions. You see the men loaded with gold and medals. They aren’t Hawaiians. They’re Americans. They demanded the pomp of royalty, and we pampered them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Speaking of the Americans,” the investigator asked, “what kind of amnesty will you provide for the revolutionists?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Amnesty?” Queen Liliuokalani asked, inclining her large and expressive head toward the American. “I don’t understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Amnesty,” the investigator&#160;&#160; explained&#160;&#160; condescendingly.&#160;&#160; “It means . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know what the word means,” Liliuokalani interrupted. “But what does it mean in this circumstance?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hawaii’s undergone some unfortunate trouble. It’s over. You’re restored to your throne. President Cleveland assumes that you’ll issue a proclamation of general amnesty. It’s usually done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Amnesty!” the powerful queen repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If not amnesty, what did you have in mind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Beheading, of course,” the queen replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What was that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The rebels will have to be beheaded. It’s the custom of the islands. He who acts against the throne is beheaded.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The American investigator gasped, then swallowed hard. “Your Excellency,” he said, “are you aware that there are over sixty American citizens involved?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I did not know the number of traitors, and I do not think of them as Americans. They have always claimed to be Hawaiians, and they shall be beheaded.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All sixty?” the investigator asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Liliuokalani asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think I had better report to President Cleveland,” the perspiring investigator gulped, excusing himself from the august presence; and that night he wrote: “There are factors here which we may not have considered adequately in the past.” After that there was no more talk of restoring the monarchy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thus, in late 1893, it became apparent that the United States would neither accept Hawaii in view of the besmirched character of the men who had led the revolution nor restore a monarchy that threatened to behead more than sixty American citizens. So the islands drifted year by year, ships without moorings. Hawaiians grew to hate the haoles who had defrauded them of their monarchy, and haoles despised the weak-kneed American senators who refused to accept their responsibilities and annex the islands. Sugar planters suffered, and it looked as if Colorado and Louisiana would keep Hawaiian sugar out of the mainland permanently. The great ships of the H &amp; H carried less cargo, and both the British and the Japanese began wondering what, in decency, they ought to do about this rudderless ship drifting across the dangerous Pacific. In desperation the sugar men proposed a treaty which would allow them to peddle their accumulating sugar to Australia, and it was predicted that Hawaii would soon have to join the British Empire.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this juncture Micah Hale saved Hawaii, and he was well prepared for his role. Years before in Lahaina his missionary father had kept him penned up in a walled garden where he had done nothing but study history, the Bible and his father’s fierce sense of rectitude. Particularly, he had served two apprenticeships which now fortified him in the job of building a new government: he had watched his father translate the book of Ezekiel, so that the stern phrases of that obdurate prophet lived in his mind; and he had listened when his lame little father explained how John Calvin and Theodore Beza had governed Geneva in accordance with the will of God.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first thing Micah Hale did was to deprive Wild Whip Hoxworth of any connection with the government. Next he insisted upon moral laws and fiscal responsibility. But above all, like a true missionary, he wrote. For the newspapers he wrote justifications of his government. For magazines he explained why the Hawaii revolution, which he had not wanted, was similar to the uprisings that had brought William and Mary to ‘the English throne. To Republican senators he wrote voluminously, providing them with ammunition to be fired against the Democrats, and to long-forgotten friends across America he wrote inspired letters, begging them to accept Hawaii. He lived solely for the purpose of making his islands part of the United States, and his pen, as it pushed across paper in the quiet hours after midnight, was the only real weapon the islanders had left.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not a liberal government that Micah founded. When the wealthy men who were to draw up a new constitution met, he lectured: “Your job is to build a Christian state in which only responsible men of good reputation and solid ownership of property are allowed to govern.” Explicit property qualifications were set for all who served and all who voted to have them serve. No man could be a member of the senate who did not own $3,000 worth of property untouched by mortgages, or who did not possess a yearly income of $1,200. In order to vote for a senator, a man was required to own $3,000 worth of property or to have an income of $600. Explained Micah: “In other parts of the world the uneducated workingman raises his voice in anger against his superiors, but not in Hawaii.” Wherever possible, advantages were given to plantation owners, for upon them rested the welfare of the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">On one point Micah was adamant: no Oriental must be allowed to vote or to participate in the government in any way. “They were brought to these islands to labor in the cane fields, and when their work was done they were supposed to go back home. There was no intention that they stay here, and if they do so, there is no place in our public life for them.” Therefore, at Micah’s suggestion, cleverly worded literacy tests were required for suffrage, and no Chinese or Japanese, even if he were wealthy and a citizen, could possibly pass them.</p>

  <p class="normal">In many respects Micah’s government was too liberal for the sugar men who had thrown it into power, and there were many Hales and Whipples and Hewletts among the missionary group who opposed his radical liberalism, while the Janderses and Hoxworths considered him insane with French republican principles; for once the electorate had been restricted to the well-to-do. Micah was lenient and just in all other matters. He insisted upon trial by jury, the rights of habeas corpus, freedom of religion and all the appurtenances of an Anglo-Saxon democracy. But when in the later stages of the constitutional convention he was asked, “What kind of government are you building here?” he replied quickly, “One that will mark time decently until the United States accepts us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From this great basic principle he never wavered. A lesser man than Micah might have been tempted by his power, but this austere New Englander was not. He awarded himself no medals, erected no fanciful structures of power about his erect white-suited figure. In the five years following the revolution of 1893 this ordained minister never once let a day pass without getting down on his knees and praying, “Almighty God, bring our plan to fruition. Make us part of America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah’s training as a Calvinist enabled him to face many crises with an absolute conviction that he was right, and when ugly decisions had to be made, he was willing to make them. In 1895 an armed revolution broke out against his government, and with unequivocating force he put it down, then arrested Queen Liliuokalani for her supposed complicity in it. When weak-livered men counseled caution in dealing with the fiery queen, Micah said, “She will be tried on charges of treason against this republic.” And he stood firm when a jury subservient to the sugar men brought in a verdict of guilty. Of course, any other jury would have had to do the same, for the queen, refusing to honor the usurpers from America who had stolen her throne, naturally worked against them and, although there were conflicting reports on the matter, probably also encouraged her followers to open rebellion; the new nation had no recourse but to try her for treason, and when the sugar men found her guilty, it was Micah’s responsibility to imprison her.</p>

  <p class="normal">The powerful, headstrong woman was incarcerated in an upper room of the palace, and while her imprisonment was rigorously policed, it was never physically unpleasant, and before long her adherents were circulating the greatest state paper ever produced by a sovereign of the islands. It was a song transcribed by Liliuokalani while in prison, and although she had composed it some years before, it had gained little notice; now its lament swept the island and the world, “Aloha Oe”: “Gently sweeps the rain cloud o’er the cliff, borne swiftly by the western gale.” One of the missionary men said of this song: “While she was free Queen Liliuokalani never did a thing for her people, but when she was in jail she expressed their soul.” Micah Hale, hearing the melody, said, “Let her go free,” and she left for Washington, there to fight against him bitterly.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the revolution was put down and the new government stabilized, it seemed for a brief interval as if President Cleveland and the Democrats might accept Hawaii. Mainland newspapers were beginning to write: “The moral stature of Micah Hale has gone far to correct the evils perpetrated by younger Americans during the revolution.” At last Micah reported to his cabinet: “I am beginning to see hope.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then Wild Whip Hoxworth exploded across the front pages of America, and editors wrote: “This violent young man has served to remind us of the viciousness whereby men like himself stole Hawaii from Queen Liliuokalani.” And hope of annexation evaporated.</p>

  <p class="normal">The trouble started during a three-day orgy at a Chinese brothel on Rat Alley in Iwilei. Whip had driven down to see a Spanish girl picked off a ship just in from Valparaiso, and he was enjoying himself when one of the sailors from the ship appeared with a claim that the girl belonged to him by right of purchase. A dreadful brawl ensued in which the intruding sailor was well whipped and kicked about the face. When he recovered, he stormed back into the brothel with two friends armed with knives, and they started to carve pieces out of Whip’s face, but the Valparaiso girl sided with Whip and crashed a stool into the face of the leader, who, already weak from the beating Whip had earlier administered, collapsed, whereupon Whip kicked him about the head so furiously that the man nearly died.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip was not arrested, of course, not only because the affair had happened in Iwilei, which was more or less outside police jurisdiction, but also because there were many witnesses to the fact that three men had come at him with knives, and he had two scars to prove that they had cut him before he had manhandled them. This affair might have passed without more than local notice except that the wounded sailor was a man of obstinate character, and as soon as he was discharged from the hospital he bought himself a gun, waited for Whip in a Hotel Street bar, and shot him through the left shoulder as he walked by.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was news of this shooting that reached America, where it vitiated much that Micah Hale had been accomplishing, but insofar as Hawaii was concerned, the worst was yet to come, for at the height of the scandal, Wild Whip got married, and this was almost insupportable, for the girl he married—with his left arm in a sling—was Mae Forbes. She was a beautiful girl of twenty, with long black hair, sinewy charm and perfect complexion. She had a soft low voice and was known to be of impeccable reputation, for her father, recognizing her beauty, had brought her up with extra care. Normally, the marriage of a vigorous young man like Wild Whip to a beautiful girl like Mae Forbes would have been acclaimed, especially as it was a love match and there was some hope that Mae might tame the fiery Hoxworth.</p>

  <p class="normal">Instead, the marriage was so offensive to Hawaii that it overshadowed all of Wild Whip’s former behavior, because Mae Forbes sprang from a rather curious parentage. Her grandmother was the daughter of one of the lesser alii families from Maui, and her grandfather, Josiah Forbes, was a strong-minded, able Englishman from Bristol, who had jumped ship on the Big Island to make a small fortune pressing sugar. Later he married his Maui sweetheart, a fine Hawaiian woman, and they had a pert daughter, but she was a headstrong girl who liked to do as she wished, and at the age of nineteen she married a Chinese farmer named Ching, so that her daughter who went by the name of Mae Forbes was really Ching Lan Tsin, Perfect Flower Ching, and her marriage to Whipple Hoxworth was the first example of an Oriental, or part-Oriental, in her case, marrying into a major island family. It was a terrifying foretaste of the future, and Wild Whip was ostracized.</p>

  <p class="normal">Even though his behavior had damaged Hawaii he would probably have been allowed to remain in the islands except for a public brawl he engaged in with the Hewlett boys. It arose when he found that some of the Committee of Nine had developed second thoughts about the revolution and were now preaching against union with America: “Somebody pointed out that as soon as we come under American law, our contracts for forced labor will be declared void, and we won’t be free to import any more Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Anything wrong with that?” Whip asked scornfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can we grow sugar without contract labor?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Frankly, and all sentiment aside, what good does contract labor do you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, they’ve got to work where we say, at a fixed wage, and if they don’t we can depend on our judges to make them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, I’ll be goddamned!” Whip snorted. “Don’t you men ever read the papers? Of course our labor laws will be rejected by America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then we don’t want to join America,” one of the Hewlett boys said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you propose?” Whip asked politely.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Join England. She allows contract labor. Or go it alone.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip was stunned. The revolution was slipping away from him. First Cleveland frustrated it and now the original conspirators were talking of union with England. “Look,” he said carefully, “you don’t need the old labor contracts. For the last eleven years I’ve not dragged one of my men into court. If they want to leave, okay. I give them good food, a fair deal, a little humor, and they make more sugar for me than they do for all of you put together. Believe me, that’s the pattern of the future.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the Hewlett boys was offended by this wisdom and added, unwisely, “There’s one more thing you do for the men, Whip.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You also sleep with their wives.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Like a volcano about to build a new island, Wild Whip erupted from his chair, lunged at the Hewletts and would have maimed the man who had insulted him had not other committee members pinioned him.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Micah Hale summoned Whip to his study on King Street. “You must leave the islands, Whipple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the revolution’s falling apart!” Whip protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Revolutions always do,” Micah replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“These poor bastards are talking of joining England, or going it alone. Just to make a few more dollars on their labor contracts.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s all beside the point, Whipple. You’re contaminating the new nation, and for the good of all, you’ve got to go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I’m determined to fight this insidious idea of surrender. I’ll not let this revolution . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Get out!” Micah thundered. “I’m trying to save Hawaii, and I can’t do it if you’re here. You’re an evil, corrupt bully, and these islands have no place for you. Go!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old man shoved Whipple from the door, so in the vital years that followed, Wild Whip traveled abroad with his Chinese-Hawaiian wife, his two facial scars offsetting her crystalline beauty; and from a distance he followed the affairs of home. He was in Rio when word arrived of McKinley’s election to the Presidency, and he paused in his work long enough to tell Ching-ching, as he called his wife, “In two years the islands’ll join America. Thank God it’s over.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we return for the celebration?” Ching-ching asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Whip scowled. “It’s Uncle Micah’s show. All I did was get him started.” He said no more about annexation, for he was on the trail of something that was to have almost as profound an effect upon Hawaii as her union with the United States. One morning he burst into his wife’s room in their hotel in Rio de Janeiro, crying, “Ching-ching! I want you to taste something.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are you doing?” she laughed, for she was not yet out of bed and he was wheeling in a small table bearing one dish, a knife and a fork.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m bringing you one of the most delicious things yet invented. Tuck a towel under your chin.” He threw her one of his shirts and tied the sleeves about her pretty olive throat. Then from a paper sack he produced a large, golden, barrel-shaped pineapple. Holding it aloft by its spiny leaves, he asked, “You ever see a more perfect fruit than this?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Very large for a pineapple,” Ching-ching remarked. “Where’d you get it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“More than six pounds. They tell me ships bring them down here regularly from French Guiana. They’re called Cayennes, but wait till you taste one.” With a large, sharp knife Wild Whip proceeded to slice away the hard outer skin and the series of eyes. Soon a most delicious aroma filled the room and a golden juice ran down off the tip of the knife, staining the tablecover.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Watch out, Whip!” his wife cautioned. “It’s dripping.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what makes it smell so good,” he explained. With a sturdy cut across the middle of the pineapple he laid it in half, then sliced off a perfect circle of heavy, golden, aromatic fruit. He slapped it onto the plate, handed Ching-ching a fork and invited her to taste her first Cayenne.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s heavenly!” she cried as the slightly acid juice stained her chin. “Where did you say they grow?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Up north.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We ought to plant these in Hawaii,” she suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I propose to,” he replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Micah Hale was approaching seventy-six and was more tired than he dared admit, word reached Honolulu that in Washington the House of Representatives had finally approved annexation by a vote of 209 to 91. That night Micah’s vigil began, for at dinner he said to his wife Malama, “We have two more weeks to wait, and then we’ll know what the Senate is going to do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you confident?” his gracious Hawaiian wife inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If prayer to an understanding God is efficacious, then I am confident.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hales ate in candlelight and sat across from each other so that verbal communication was quick and direct. Malama, in her sixty-fifth year, was stately rather than vivacious. She had not gone to flesh as had so many of her Hawaiian sisters, and her silvery gray hair was complemented by the pale light. She retained her saucy manner of tilting her head quizzically when an idea amused her, and now she said softly, “It will be proper for Hawaii to submerge itself in America. We’re a poor, weak group of islands, and anyone who had really wanted us in the last fifty years could have snatched us. It’s better this way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah, momentarily relaxed by the good news from Congress, asked, “Do you know, Malama, how sorry I am that it had to be your husband who did the things of the last five years?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It had to be somebody,” she said to the erect, austere missionary. “Of all the Hawaiians, you understood most clearly,” he said. “But I suppose that’s to be expected. Noelani’s daughter and Malama’s granddaughter.” At the mention of these distinguished names he unexpectedly found tears in his eyes, and he wanted to hide his face in his hands, but Malama saw them, and if she had been sitting beside her husband, she would, Hawaiian-fashion, have comforted him, but on this important night they sat apart and only ideas sped between them, not love. Micah said, “It would have been so much better if you had been queen and not Liliuokalani. You would have understood, but she never could.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Malama said slowly, “it was better that we had a headstrong, volatile Hawaiian. Let the world see us dying as we actually were.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dying?” Micah repeated in surprise.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, dying,” Malama said with subtle firmness. “Soon our islands will be Oriental and there will be no place for Hawaiians.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His wife’s comments were strange, and Micah pointed out: “But in the constitution we were careful to put up safeguards against the Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s only a paper, Micah,” she pointed out. “We Hawaiians know that we’re being pushed over in the canoe.” “You’ll be protected!” Micah cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We had an earlier constitution that was supposed to protect us,” Malama said, “but it didn’t prevent the sugar robbers from stealing our lands . . . and then our country.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama!” Micah gasped. “Are you contending that only cupidity directed this revolution? Do you refuse to see the forces of American democracy at work here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All I can see is that when our fields were barren no one wanted us, but when they were rich with sugar, everyone wanted us. What else can I conclude?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah was disturbed by the turn this conversation was taking and he went far back into memory: “Do you recall the first time I ever saw you? In San Francisco? And I said then, before I ever saw a sugar field, ‘Hawaii must become a part of the United States’? I thought so &#160;for moral reasons,&#160; and&#160; my motivations have never changed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not yours, Micah. But others’ changed. And in the end you were pitifully used by a gang of robbers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no, Malama! As it worked out, it was I who used them. Hawaii’s going to be annexed, on my terms.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was stolen by fraud,” Malama said coldly. “We poor, generous Hawaiians were abused, lied about, debased in public and defrauded of our nation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Micah protested, rising and walking around the table to be with his wife.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would rather you did not touch me now, Micah,” she said without bitterness. “What do you think I have felt, when I met my Hawaiian friends, and they asked me, ‘How could Micah Hale write the things he did about us?’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What things?” Micah cried, returning disconsolately to his chair. “I never wrote anything about you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To his surprise, Malama took from her pocket, where in bitterness she had kept it until this moment should arise, a clipping from one of his major articles, and in sorrow she read it: ” ‘The indigenous citizens are for the most part illiterate, steeped in idolatry, committed to vain shows of monarchical display and totally unsuited to govern themselves.’ What abominable words.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I wasn’t writing about you,” he protested. “I was writing to help make these islands a part of America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You were writing about Hawaiians,” Malama said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah, in his white suit, sat staring at the tablecover brought years ago from China. He was astonished at his wife’s position in this matter and he thought of several lines of explanation that might be helpful in describing the choices he had faced, but when he looked up at her grave, accusing face, he realized that none would be of use. Therefore he said, “I am sorry if I have offended you, Malama.” And she replied, “I am sorry, Micah, if I have brought up unpleasant subjects on your night of triumph. But we must not fool ourselves by words. Hawaii was stolen. Its liberties were raped.” In stately manner this daughter of the alii rose, kicked her train behind her, and left the dining room. Micah, disconsolate, watched her depart, then dropped his head on the table for some minutes, after which he rose and walked to his study, where he composed a long and passionate letter of instructions to his representatives in Washington, telling them: “You must see every senator at least once a day. Tell him that the manifest destiny of America consists of an extension of God’s grace to these islands. We cannot delay much longer, for the Japanese and English are beginning to make unpleasant moves and tardiness is suicide. Plead with them. Leave no argument to chance, and if the senators from Louisiana and Colorado fight with dirty weapons, fight back. We have got to make these islands American in this session. To your hands I commit the fate of Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">During the days that followed, Micah and Malama Hale avoided each other as much as possible. With each elating letter from Washington, for chances in the Senate looked increasingly good, the distance between the American missionary and the Hawaiian alii grew greater, and it was borne home to Micah a thousand times now sorrowful a thing it is to destroy a sovereignty. It was right that Hawaii become American. It was inevitable, and he was increasingly proud of his role in accomplishing this benediction; but it was also tragic, and in these last days the tragedy was greater than the joy.</p>

  <p class="normal">On July 6, 1898, the American Senate finally accepted Hawaii by a vote of 42 to 21. In the Senate gallery David Hale, Micah’s personal emissary to Congress, wept, and his assistant Micah Whipple said, “This is the beginning of America’s greatness in world politics.” One week later, on July 13, the news reached Honolulu, and an excited sailor discharged a gun. Nerves were on edge and some thought this might be the beginning of a counter-revolution, but soon the electrifying word swept through the city and men ran out into the streets and embraced one another. It was a wild, joyous day, with enough noise to be heard around the globe, but Wild Whip Hoxworth, in the jungles of French Guiana, did not hear the news for almost two months. When he did he said to Ching-ching, “Well, we’re Americans at last. You feel any different?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You may be an American,” Ching-ching replied. “I’m still a Chinese. I don’t think your country will ever want me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On August 12, 1898, by proclamation of President McKinley, Hawaii joined the United States, but in the islands this happy event seemed more like a funeral than a birth. No Hawaiians appeared that day, for they mourned in secret, but a good many Americans in tight coats, brown plug hats and patent-leather shoes roamed the streets wearing gaudy badges that showed Uncle Sam entering into matrimony with a Negro woman—the mainland manufacturers having been unable to visualize a Hawaiian—accompanied by the rubric: “This is our wedding day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Out of deference to the Hawaiians, the day’s ceremonies were kept brief. Soldiers marched and sailors came ashore from an American warship. At eleven forty-five a distinguished group of men responsible for the revolution appeared on the grandstand, led by Micah Hale. As he took his place, he looked out upon the gathering and saw Americans, Chinese, Portuguese and Japanese, but never a Hawaiian. When the once-impressive band began the Hawaiian anthem, the gasps that came from the horns would not have done justice to a group of beginners, for one by one the weeping Hawaiian members of the band had crept away, refusing to play the final dirge of their nation. The anthem ended in a sob and Micah began reading: “With full confidence in the honor, justice and friendship of the American people . . .” He had first dreamed of this day while crossing the Nebraska prairies in 1849. Now, almost half a century later, he had made it come to pass.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the platform&#160; that day there was one Hawaiian, Malama Kanakoa Hale, for Micah had pleaded with her: “It is your duty,” and as an alii she had understood these words. Dressed in regal black and purple, with a flowery hat and an ivory fan, she was an imposing figure, the final symbol of her defeated race. Even when the warships boomed their salute of twenty-one guns and when the flag she had loved so well came down, she had the fortitude to stare ahead. “I will not let them see me weep,” she muttered to herself.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when the ceremonies were ended, a most shameful thing occurred, and to Malama it would always epitomize the indecency by which her nation had been destroyed. As the Hawaiian flag fell, an American caught it and, before he could be stopped, whisked it away to the palace cellar where, with a pair of long shears, he cut the emblem into strips and began passing them out as souvenirs of the day.</p>

  <p class="normal">One was jammed into Micah’s hand and he looked down to see what it was, but his eyes were so strained from writing letters on behalf of Hawaii that he could not easily discern what he held, and imprudently he raised it aloft. Then he saw that it contained fragments of the eight stripes symbolizing the islands of Hawaii and a corner of the field, and he realized what a disgraceful thing had been done to this proud flag. Hastily he crumpled it lest his wife see and be further offended, but as he pushed the torn cloth into his pocket he heard from behind a cry of pain, and he turned to see that his wife had at last been forced to cover her face in shame.</p>

  <p class="normal">AS <span>THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</span> drew to a close, and as Hawaii accustomed itself to being a part of the United States, it gradually became apparent to the residents of Honolulu that in the Kee family Hawaii had another of those great, intricate Chinese units which were destined, by force of numbers alone, to play an important role in the community. There was old Mrs. Kee—known to the family simply as Wu Chow’s Auntie—now fifty-two years of age and bent from arduous work. There were her five clever sons, Asia, Europe, Africa, America and Australia, and their five wives, a prolific brood with a total of thirty-eight children and a promise of more to come. Thus, as the century ended, there were already forty-nine Kees in the family, many of them approaching marriageable age. In two more decades the Kees would probably number more than two hundred.</p>

  <p class="normal">To Nyuk Tsin, who still sold pineapples and taro-stem pickles through the town barefooted, her two baskets hanging down from her bamboo carry-stick and her conical woven hat darting along the alleys of Chinatown, the multiplication of her offspring was gratifying indeed, and whenever on her daily huckstering trips she reached the point where Hotel Street crossed Maunakea, in the heart of Chinatown, she felt a glow of satisfaction. Years ago she had made a cold calculation that of her five sons—who shared the world among them—it would be Africa who would grow into the ablest. He had been given the education, and now at the age of thirty-one he was a leader in the Chinese community: Africa Kee, Lawyer. The sign in gold letters said so, but what it did not say was that the building in which his office stood was also his and that several of the stores in Chinatown belonged either to him or to his brothers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, the specific title to these buildings was of little consequence, for although to outward appearances it was Asia Kee who owned the profitable restaurant on Hotel Street, it was really owned by the Kees as a family. Under Nyuk Tsin’s guidance, the five brothers had formed a combination known in Hawaii by the expressive term hui, pronounced hooey—”Them Kees got a hui workin”—and it was this informal corporation, the great Kee hui, that effectively controlled the family income. If Australia’s lovely wife, the Ching girl, acquired from her family a small inheritance, it did not go to Australia or to his children. It went into the hui, for no member of the Kee family could begin to identify the benefits he himself had already drawn from the hui. His clothes, his education, the education of his sons, his home, his start in business: all these things had been paid for by the hui; and if he were willing to hand over everything he was to earn for the rest of his life, he still could never discharge his debt to the hui.</p>

  <p class="normal">No one felt this obligation more than Africa. It was through the energies of his four brothers that he had received his legal education at Michigan. To maintain him in law school they had deprived themselves; yet they never complained, for they agreed with Nyuk Tsin that the ablest of the group must be educated, to help protect the rest. And Africa Kee did just that. At present the Kee hui controlled seven businesses, and Africa guided each along the narrow path between conservative prudence and radical recklessness. He financed every new venture and advised when, earlier ones should be liquidated. He selected which real estate to buy, what corner to lease for a store, and which mainland college the Kee grandsons should be sent to. For the present he was the central brain power of a trivial Chinese empire of dirty little shops, grubby efforts to make money and small landholdings. But it was not his intention that the Kee empire should remain small, and whenever he met with his brothers—they in pigtails and Chinese dress; he shorn and in the clothes he had learned to wear at Michigan—he preached one doctrine: “This hui has got to grow.” To make it do so, Africa gambled in a manner that would have pleased his father, and the Kees rarely held property for even a week before borrowing heavily on it to buy more property, on which they also borrowed as soon as possible. All the Kee stores bought on credit, but obligations were carefully met as such came due. The hui never had any cash; it always owed debts that would have staggered a haole; and under Africa’s calculating guidance it was beginning to prosper.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin, pleased with the manner in which he was taking hold of business problems, did not dominate her family, except in three particulars. Every Kee child had to be educated, and during the year 1900 this apparently impecunious Chinese family was preparing to send three grandsons to college in America--doctor, dentist, lawyer --and within the next decade fourteen more Kees would be ready to go. Nyuk Tsin herself went barefooted in order to save money to pay mainland tuitions, and it did not matter to her if her sons’ wives were forced to do the same. The sprawling family lived with terrifying frugality in order to pinch off each fugitive penny that might be saved to provide some sparkling grandson with an education.</p>

  <p class="normal">In this profound resolve Nyuk Tsin was constantly abetted by the wild-eyed Englishman, Uliassutai Karakoram Blake, who enjoyed walking down from the Church of England school to visit with her in Chinese. He said, “I used to curse the Yankee threat to Hawaii, and at one time I wanted to take arms against America, but when annexation took place I shrugged my shoulders and said, ‘America’s no worse than England. They’re both bloody robbers, and if I can stand one I suppose I can stand the other.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">He encouraged Nyuk Tsin to educate her grandchildren to their maximum capacity. “Have you ever stopped to figure, Wu Chow’s Auntie, what it cost you to make Africa a lawyer? And how much you’ve already got back in return? Well, be assured that in the future the rate of return will be even greater.” He was a flamboyant man and his ferocious mustaches flourished in the little Nuuanu room as he spoke of the future: “Science, mathematics, speculation! Who knows where they will lead? But wherever they take us, Wu Chow’s Auntie, only the educated man will be able to follow.” She always felt better after a talk with Uliassutai Blake; she wished she had gone to school to such a teacher. For his part, the eccentric Englishman found real joy in talking with one of the two people who understood his dynamic interpretation of the world. The other was a thin, hawk-eyed young revolutionary then seeking refuge in Hawaii: Sun Yat Sen. Even better than Nyuk Tsin, he comprehended what his teacher Blake was talking about.</p>

  <p class="normal">The second particular in which Nyuk Tsin dictated to her family was the matter of houses; she considered it a waste of money to build pretentious homes, especially since reliable people spent their time working outside. Therefore she kept as many of her sons jammed into the bleak clapboard house and its sprawling sheds as possible. Obviously, not all forty-nine Kees could crowd into even that commodious shack, but an astonishing number did. Asia and his family were excused to live in back of the restaurant; Europe and his brood were permitted to live over the vegetable store, but all the others crowded somehow into the Nuuanu residence. There the Hawaiian wives cooked fairly regular meals and the grandchildren learned to talk pidgin and eat poi. By 1899 Africa could well have afforded a home of his own, but even though Nyuk Tsin allowed him to juggle every cent the hui commanded, she did not consider him capable of deciding where he wanted to live, so at thirty-one with a wife and five children, he stayed on at the old house. “It saves money,” she said. The bulging house now owned four ukuleles, and fat Apikela, white-haired and benevolent, taught all her grandchildren how to strum the little instrument. It was a noisy house, with a Hawaiian mother and a hard-working, silent Chinese auntie.</p>

  <p class="normal">The third particular in which Nyuk Tsin dominated her family was in the purchase of land. Her Hakka hunger for this greatest of the world’s commodities would never be satiated, and she was haunted by a recurring nightmare: she saw her constantly increasing brood and there was never enough land for each Kee to stand upon and to raise his arms and move about. So whenever the Kee hui had a few dollars left over after paying education bills, she insisted that they acquire more land. To do so in Honolulu was not easy, for generally speaking, land, Hawaii’s most precious resource, was not sold; it was leased. Nor was it parceled into acres or lots; it was leased by the square foot. The Hoxworths owned tremendous areas of land, inherited from the Alii Nui Noelani, and so did the Hewletts, inherited through the old missionary’s second wife. The Kanakoa family had huge estates; and the Janderses and the Whipples, although they owned little, controlled enormous areas through leases. Whoever owned land grew wealthy, and it was the ironclad law of the great haole families never to sell. Hawaiians were willing to sell, but their land was usually in the country. Therefore, when the bent little Chinese woman Nyuk Tsin decided to get enough Honolulu land for her multiplying family her interests threw her directly athwart the established wealth of the island.</p>

  <p class="normal">I remarked some time back that if the haoles in Hawaii had wanted to protect themselves from the Chinese they should have shot Uliassutai Karakoram Blake. That chance passed, and the Chinese got their education. In 1900, if the haoles had still wanted to maintain their prerogatives, and apparently they did, they should have shot Nyuk Tsin; but none had ever heard of her. They thought that the guiding force behind the Kee family was the lawyer, Africa, and they kept a close watch on him.</p>

  <p class="normal">In late 1899 Africa found himself hemmed in, unable to make a move, and he had to report to his auntie: “It’s getting almost impossible to buy land. The haoles simply won’t sell.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much money does the hui have?” Nyuk Tsin asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Four thousand dollars in cash, and we could convert more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you tried to buy business land toward Queen Street?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No luck.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Leases?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No luck.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Kee empire, almost before it got started, was stalemated, and it might have remained so had it not received dramatic assistance from a rat.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Thanksgiving day in 1899 the blue-funneled H &amp; H steamer Maui put into harbor after an uneventful trip from Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong and Yokohama. As its seamen curled their landing lines artfully through the air and then sent heavy hawsers after them, this brown rat that was to salvage the fortunes of the Kee hui scuttled down from ship to shore, carrying a hideful of fleas. It ran through some alleys and wound up in the grimy kitchen of a family named Chang.</p>

  <p class="normal">On December 12, 1899, as the old century lay dying, an old man named Chang also lay dying with a dreadful fever that seemed to spring from large, purplish nodules in his armpits and groin. When young Dr. Hewlett Whipple from the Department of Health picked his way through the alleys to certify that the man had died of natural causes, he studied the corpse with apprehension.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t bury this man,” he ordered, and within ten minutes he had returned, breathless, with two other young doctors, each of whom carried a medical book. In silence the three men studied the corpse and looked at one another in horror.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is it what I think it is?” Dr. Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The plague,” his associate replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“May God have mercy on us!” Whipple prayed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The three doctors walked soberly back to their Department of Health, trying to mask from the general public the terror they felt, for they knew that in Calcutta the plague had once killed thousands in a few weeks; there was no known remedy, and when this dreadful disease struck a community, the epidemic had to burn itself out in frightful death and terror. When they reached their Department office, the three doctors closed the doors and sat silent for a moment, as if trying to muster courage for the things they must now do. Then Dr. Whipple, who had inherited his great-grandfather’s force of character, said simply, “We must burn that house immediately. We must set aside a special burying ground. And we must inspect every house in Honolulu. It is absolutely essential that not a single sick person be hidden from us. Are you agreed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There will be protests against the burning,” one of the other doctors argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We burn, or we face a calamity of such size that I cannot imagine it,” Dr. Whipple replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d rather we talked with the older doctors.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They did, summoning them in fearful haste, and the older men were sure that their junior colleagues must have been panicked by some ordinary disease with extraordinary developments. It’s unlikely that we have the plague in Honolulu. We’ve kept it out of here for seventy years.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Another argued: “I think we ought to see the body,” and four of the established physicians started to leave for the grimy little shack in Chinatown, but Dr. Whipple protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll create consternation among the Chinese,” he warned. “I went and hurried away for my associates. Now if you appear, they’ll know something is wrong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not going to announce that we have the plague in this city until I see for myself,” a big, solidly built doctor said, “and I want two experienced men to come along with me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Before you go,” Whipple asked, seeing that they were leaving without medical books, “what symptoms would convince you that it is truly the plague?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw the plague in China,” the older doctor evaded haughtily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what symptoms?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Purplish nodules in the groin. Smaller ones in the armpits. Marked fever accompanied by hallucinations. And a characteristic smell from the punctured nodules.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple licked his lips, for they were achingly dry, and said, “Dr. Harvey, when you go, take a policeman along to guard the house. We must burn it tonight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">An ominous hush fell upon the room, and Dr. Harvey finally asked, “Then it is the plague?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an apprehensive silence, a moment of hesitation, followed by Dr. Harvey’s stubborn insistence: “I cannot authorize the required steps until I see for myself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you will take a policeman?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course. And you can be talking about what we must do next … in the unlikely event that it is indeed the plague.” He hurried off, taking two frightened companions with him, and it was a long time before he returned; and during this interval the three young doctors on whom the burden of a quarantine would fall were afraid that their older confreres would refuse to sanction emergency measures until the plague had established itself, but in this uncharitable supposition they quite underestimated Dr. Harvey.</p>

  <p class="normal">After an hour he rushed into the Department of Health, ashen-faced and with the news that it was the bubonic plague. He had searched all houses in the immediate vicinity and had uncovered another dead body and three cases near death, so on his own recognizance he had alerted the Fire Department to stand by for immediate action of the gravest importance. “Gentlemen,” he puffed, “Honolulu is already in the toils of the bubonic plague. May God give us the strength to fight it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night the terror began. The determined doctors summoned government officials and told them coldly: “The only way to combat this scourge is to burn every house where the plague has struck. Burn it, burn it, burn it!”</p>

  <p class="normal">A timorous official protested: “How can we burn a house without permission of the owner? In Chinatown it’ll take us weeks to find out who owns what. And even if we don’t make mistakes we’ll be subject to lawsuits.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good God!” Dr. Harvey shouted, banging the table with his fist. “You speak of lawsuits. How many people do you think may be dead by Christmas? I’ll tell you. We’ll be lucky if our losses are less than two thousand. Whipple here may be dead, because he touched the body. I may be dead, because I did, too. And you may be dead, because you associated with us. Now burn those goddamned buildings immediately.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The government summoned the Fire Department and asked if they had perfected any way to burn one building and not the one standing beside it. “There’s always a risk,” the fire fighters replied. “But it’s been done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is there wind tonight?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing unusual.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could you burn four houses? Completely?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t do anything. Don’t say anything.” Nothing happened that night.</p>

  <p class="normal">For three agonizing days the debate continued, with the doctors appalled by the delay. In the unspeakable warrens of Chinatown they uncovered three dozen new cases and eleven deaths. Old men would suddenly complain of fevers and pains in their groin. Their faces would become blanched with pain, then fiery red with burning temperatures. Their desire for water was extraordinary, and they died trembling, a hideous smell enveloping them whenever one of their nodules broke. It was the raging, tempestuous plague, but still the finicky debate continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last Drs. Harvey and Whipple announced the facts to the general public: “Honolulu is in the grip of an epidemic of bubonic plague. The death toll cannot at this time be predicted, and the most severe measures must be taken to combat the menace.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now general panic swept the city. A cordon was thrown around Chinatown and no one inside the area was allowed to move out. Churches and schools were suspended and no groups assembled. Ships were asked to move to other harbors and life in the city ground to a slow, painful halt. It was a terrible Christmas, that last one of the nineteenth century, and there was no celebration when the new year and the new century dawned.</p>

  <p class="normal">During Christmas week the fires started. Dr. Whipple and his team showed the firemen where deaths had occurred, and after precautions were taken, the houses were burned. Chinatown was divided roughly into the business area toward the ocean and the crowded living areas toward the mountains, and although the plague had started in the former area, it now seemed concentrated in the closely packed homes. Therefore the doctors recommended that an entire section be eliminated, and the government agreed, for by burning this swath across the city, a barrier would be cut between the two areas. The condemned area happened to include Dr. John Whipple’s original mansion, now crowded by slums, and his great-grandson felt tears coming to his eyes when he saw the old family home go up in flames that he himself had set. It was a ghastly business to burn down a city that one had worked so hard to build, but the fires continued, and patrols kept back the Chinese who sought to escape the doomed areas and circulate generally throughout the city. Refugee camps were established in church grounds, with tents for those whose houses had been burned and sheds for cooking food. Mrs. Henry Hewlett supervised one camp, Mrs. Rudolph Hale another, and Mrs. John Janders a third on the slopes of Punchbowl, the volcanic crater that rose on the edge of the city. Blankets were supplied by teams that searched the city, Mrs. Malama Hoxworth having taken charge of that effort. David Hale, Jr., and his uncle Tom Whipple set up the field kitchens and ran them, riding from one camp to the other on horseback.</p>

  <p class="normal">Inspection teams were organized and every room in Honolulu was visually checked twice each day, to be sure that no new cases of the plague went unreported, and consonant with the missionary tradition from which they had sprung, it was the Hales and the Hewletts and the Whipples who volunteered for the particularly dangerous work of crawling through the Chinatown warrens to be sure no dead bodies lay hiding. It was a dreadful sight they saw, a fearful condemnation of their rule in Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">The streets of Chinatown were unpaved, filthy alleys that wound haphazardly past open cesspools. The houses were collapsing shacks that had been propped up by poles in hopes of squeezing out one more year’s rent. Inside, the homes were an abomination of window-less rooms, waterless kitchens, toiletless blocks. Stairwells had no illumination and what cellars there were stood crowded with inflammable junk. No air circulated that was not filthy. After only two generations of use, Chinatown was overcrowded to the point of suffocation, all made worse by the fact that those whose homes had already been burned had managed, by one trick or another, to slip through quarantine cordons so as to remain with their friends rather than suffer banishment to the refugee camps, and with them they brought the plague. If one had searched the world, seeking an area where a rat bearing the fleas which bred bubonic plague could most easily infect the greatest number of unprotected people, Honolulu’s Chinatown would have stood high on the list. The police had known of the pitiful overcrowding; the Department of Health had known of the unsanitary conditions; and the landlords had known best of all the menace they were perpetuating; but nobody had spoken in protest because the area was owned principally by those who were now inspecting it: the Hales, the Hewletts and the Whipples; and they had found that Chinese did pay their rents promptly. Now from this open sore the plague threatened to engulf the island, and as the inspectors bravely toured the infected areas day after day, exposing themselves to death and sleeping at nights in restricted tents lest they contaminate their own families, they often thought: “Why didn’t we do something about this sooner?”</p>

  <p class="normal">By January 15, 1900, eight substantial areas had been completely razed and innumerable rats that might have carried their infected fleas to uncontaminated sections of the city were destroyed; and it seemed as if a general eruption of the plague had been mercifully prevented. Three thousand Chinese were already in refugee camps from which they could not spread contagion, but unknown thousands were hiding out in the narrow warrens to which they had fled and they now began to accomplish what the rats could not. As the reports came into headquarters that night, each with tales of fresh death and new infection, it became hideously apparent to Dr. Whipple that the epidemic was not halted and that the fate of Honolulu hung in a precarious balance.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the sixteenth he convened his doctors again, a group of exhausted men who understood how fearful the next week could be, for by their own inspection they had proved that the plague stood poised in upper Chinatown, ready to explode across the entire city, and they knew that on this day they must either take final steps to drive it back or surrender the general community to its ravages; and the only cure they knew was fire. Dr. Whipple was first to speak: “Our teams found twenty-nine new cases yesterday.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, hell!” Dr. Harvey cried in acute frustration. He folded his arms on the table and bowed his head upon them, retiring from this part of the discussion.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All the cases this week, and most of the deaths, have been concentrated toward the mountains,” Whipple explained, pointing to a map, “and we can thank God that they seem to be leading out of the city rather than in toward the heart.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s the only good news we’ve had,” snapped an older doctor who had found seven cases in the mountain area.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple hesitated, then said, “Our obligation is clear.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean to burn that entire outlying area?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jesus, they’ll explode. They just won’t permit it, Whipple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple pressed his hands to his forehead and pleaded: “Have you an alternative?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, I’m not arguing one way or another,” the older man explained. “I’m just saying . . . Hell, Whipple, there must be five hundred homes in that area!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And every one infected with the bubonic plague.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want no part of this decision!” the older doctor protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nor me!” another cried. “Christ, Whipple, that’s half the city!”</p>

  <p class="normal">From his position with his head on his arms, Dr. Harvey asked harshly, “If your arm is infected with blood poisoning that is certain to destroy your entire body, what do you do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no answer, so after a moment he slammed his fist onto the table and shouted, “Well, what in hell do you do? You cut it off! Burn those areas. Now!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Only the government can make this decision,” Whipple said in slow, terrified tones. “But it’s got to make it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are withdrawing from this meeting,” two of the doctors warned. “Let it be recorded.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Harvey shouted, “And let it be recorded that I did not withdraw. Burn the goddamned city or perish.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the eighteenth of January, 1900, the emergency committee decided to burn a very substantial area of Honolulu in a last prayerful attempt to save the general population, and when the doomed areas were marked in red two facts became apparent: they were not in the center of town but in the residential district; and almost everyone who lived in the area was Chinese. Two members of the cabinet, as they faced the map, were in tears, and a man named Hewlett, who had a good deal of Hawaiian blood, asked, “Why does misery always fall on those least able to bear it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You burn where the plague has fallen,” a cabinet member named Hale replied. “And it’s fallen on the Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Stop this talk!” the chairman cried. “There’s already an ugly rumor that we’re burning Chinatown as punishment because the Pakes left the sugar fields. I don’t want to hear any of that libel in this room. We’re burning Chinatown because that’s where the plague is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hewlett, part-Hawaiian, felt that he was being unduly hectored, so he asked, “Would you burn here,” and he banged the haole areas of the map, “if that’s where the plague was? Would you burn your own houses?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The plague didn’t come to our houses,” the chairman replied. “It came to the Chinese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the nineteenth of January the Fire Department gave all its men the day off and advised them to sleep as much as possible in preparation for a hard day’s work on the twentieth. The Honolulu Mail in its edition that day reported: “We beg all citizens of our city to be especially alert tomorrow and to watch for flying sparks, because although the able laddies of our Fire Department have proved over and over again that they know how to set fire to one house and save the next, the very magnitude of the job they now face increases the ever-present danger of a general conflagration. Brooms and buckets of water should be at hand throughout the city.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When word of the proposed burning reached Chinatown, it created panic and many tried vainly to force their way through the cordons that kept everyone within the plague area. Those whose homes were to be razed were rounded up and solemnly marched away to a refugee camp on the slopes of Punchbowl, where they could look down at their doomed homes, and this last view of buildings which they had worked so hard to acquire inspired them with a dumb rage, and that night there were many unpleasant scenes. One Chinese who knew a little English rushed up to Mrs. John Janders, the supervisor of the Punchbowl camp, and screamed, “You doing this on purpose!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” she said quietly, “it is the plague.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No plague!” the furious Chinese cried. “Your husband own my store. He say all time, ‘More rent! More rent!’ I not pay so he decide to burn.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Mrs.&#160; Janders argued&#160; reasonably.&#160; “Mr. Apaka, it is the plague.&#160; Believe me, it would not&#160; otherwise&#160; be&#160; done.”&#160; But the Chinese knew better, and through the long night of January 19 they watched the mysterious lights of the city and waited in bitterness for the fires to begin.</p>

  <p class="normal">Fortunately, the twentieth was a calm day with no wind that might have agitated the planned blaze. At eight in the morning the firemen, according to a schedule worked out to provide maximum protection for the rest of the city, poured liberal amounts of kerosene over a small shack diagonally across from where the Whipple mansion, burned earlier, had stood. The shack certainly merited destruction, for it had already caused the deaths of five plague victims and the illness of three others. At eight-ten a match was applied to the kerosene, and the filthy hovel exploded in flame.</p>

  <p class="normal">As it blazed, a slight breeze started blowing from the northeast. It crept down from the mountains and as it funneled into the valleys that led into Honolulu it increased in speed, so that by the time it reached the flaming shack it was prepared to blow the sparks in exactly the opposite direction from that intended by the Fire Department. Within three minutes half a dozen shacks not on the list were ablaze, but they were easily evacuated and were of little value, so the fire fighters simply surrounded them and beat out any sparks that might escape toward the center of the city where property was of real value.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then at eight-thirty the capricious wind blowing down from the hills arrived in an unpredicted gust and whipped a flurry of sparks high into the air. Fortunately, the land across from the fire had already been razed, so there was no danger of spreading the flames in that direction, but the wind seemed sent from hell, for it suddenly veered and deposited many active sparks on the large Congregational church that had been completed in 1884 directly across from where the old Whipple mansion had stood. The church had two soaring steeples, for the king had reasoned: “A man has two eyes so he can see better and two ears so he can hear better. My church has got to have two steeples so it can find God better.” Now the steeples were in peril, and firemen noted that if any of the embers flamed to life on those tall spires, the rising wind would surely whip sparks clear across the areas previously burned and throw them down into the valuable center of the city, so two brave Hawaiians scrambled up the sides of the church seeking to reach the steeples, and one man arrived in time to stamp out the fires beginning on his, but the other did not, and when he pulled himself onto the upper ledge of his steeple, he found it already ablaze and he barely escaped.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a few minutes the great tall church became a torch. Its bell plunged to the basement, clanging through the flames. The famous pipe organ, imported from London, melted into lumps of useless metal, and stained-glass windows crashed into the fire. As the church burned furiously in the morning wind, many who had helped build it with their dimes and personal labor gathered to weep. But what was most important was not the loss of the church, but the fact that its unusual height made it a target for every gust that blew down the valley, and even as the people gathered at its foot to mourn, far over their heads the wind was scattering a multitude of sparks. Had the fire occurred at night, the sight would have been one of fairylike splendor, with stars of fire darting across the dark sky; but in an ominous daylight the passage of the flames occasioned no beauty and only dread. For they sped high in the air across the already burned-out areas, a few falling harmlessly on charred land but most flying on into the very heart of the city, where they descended upon dried-wood roofs, there to ignite the fires that were to destroy almost all of Chinatown. With Old Testament accuracy the embers which flew out from the Christian church fell only upon heathen homes. If the Christians of Honolulu had righteously planned to destroy every Chinese building in the city, they could have accomplished the fact no more skillfully than did the sparks erupting from their doomed church.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first blaze in downtown Chinatown occurred at nine-forty, when a sizable ember fell upon a closely packed area of houses and ignited a central one. Gangs of firemen quickly surrounded the house to extinguish the fire, and after considerable effort succeeded in doing so; but while they were at that job, another ember struck a house of somewhat special nature. On the outside it looked like an ordinary home, but when it started to burn, all the Chinese nearby fled, and Hawaiian firemen alone were left to fight its flames.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come back!” an old Chinese man kept wailing in a language the firemen could not understand. Grabbing a young Chinese he shouted, “Tell them to come back!”</p>

  <p class="normal">A group of daring Chinese hurried forward toward the burning house, grabbed the firemen by the hands and pulled them away. “Mo bettah you come back!” they yelled.</p>

  <p class="normal">The firemen, who were terribly afraid of the Chinese after the troubles of the night before and who had been cautioned that the Orientals might attempt to riot when the burnings started, interpreted this strange behavior as the start of communal rioting, and stopped fighting the fire in order to protect themselves from the Chinese, and it was fortunate that they did so, for as they left, the house exploded. In a golden, smoky gasp of flame, the little house simply disintegrated, and then the firemen understood: it was one of the closed sheds in which some trivial Chinese merchant had kept his kerosene. But what the firemen did not understand was that the explosion, frightful though it had been, was merely the beginning of something worse; for now from the ruins a series of fantastic fiery rockets exploded through the city. Some threw stars into the air. Others pinwheeled through streets, and still others went up with a crazy, violent zigzag through the morning sky, falling at last on the roof of some new house, there to burn with vigor until its shingles too were ablaze; for the shed had harbored not only kerosene but also a store of fireworks for the Chinese New Year.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the explosion of the shed, any hope of saving downtown Chinatown was lost, and for the next seven hours the anguished Chinese on the Punchbowl hillside, huddling behind the barbed wire of their refugee camp, could spot the progress of the huge blaze from one of these kerosene dumps to the next. All day the little sheds exploded with violence, throwing their flames into new areas, and wherever the fire went, sooner or later it found out a horde of fireworks, and when they soared into the air with their burdens of flame they seemed invariably to fall back onto areas that were not yet ablaze. And to make the destruction of Chinatown certain, the vagrant wind kept blowing from its unusual quarter in the hills. By midafternoon, it was apparent that hardly a Chinese house in mid-city would be spared.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it became obvious that all was doomed, the Chinese fell into panic. Old men who could barely walk after forty-five years of work in the cane fields began running into burning houses to salvage some item of family life which they prized above any other, and they soon appeared in the crowded streets hauling carts, or running with bamboo carrying-poles, each with some useless treasure. No one thought to bring blankets or food, both needed in the refugee camps, and soon the streets leading out from Chinatown were jammed with a miscellaneous horde: barefoot old women in blue smocks, men in laboring shirts, pretty young girls, their hair in braids, and round-faced babies. From a Japanese tea house two geisha girls, their faces ashen with talcum powder, hurried nervously in pin-toed, mincing steps that kept their brightly colored kimonos swaying in the smoke, while old Punti women hobbled behind on stubby feet. The pigtailed men tried to lug burdens which would have staggered horses and which soon staggered them. The escape routes became a litter of lost wealth and it was pitiful to see families who had never owned much, stooping as they ran, picking up valuables they had always coveted, only to abandon them later in the same breathless way as their owners had had to do.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the major tragedy of the day approached, for as the fleeing Chinese, with flame and firecracker at their back, sought to break out from Chinatown they ran into solid rows of impassive policemen whose merciless job it was to hold them back within the plague-ridden area. There was no intention whatever—absolutely none, the police commissioner later swore—to trap the Chinese within the fiery area, but there was an ironclad insistence that they move out by established routes that would take them not into the uninfected parts of Honolulu but into the barbed-wire refugee camps, where doctors could watch them for new outbreaks of the plague.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They won’t let us out!” a poor, dimwitted Chinese woman began screaming. “They want us to burn, in the houses they set afire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She made a futile attempt to dash past a policeman, but his orders required him to push her back toward the burning area, from which there was an orderly escape route, could she but find it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s pushing me into the fire!” the woman screamed, and men who had been free from panic suddenly realized that they were not going to be allowed out of the doomed area, and they began a concentrated rush toward the policemen.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re breaking out!” the officers called, and behind them, from the parts of the city where there was no plague, white volunteers rush up bearing clubs and crowbars and guns.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Get back!” they shouted. “There’s a safe way out!”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point, when a deadly general riot seemed inevitable, the United States Army marched onto the scene with several hundred trained soldiers, guns at the ready, and they were moved into position along all the main exit routes from Chinatown. “Under no circumstances are you to fire unless I give the order,” their captains said, and they marched stolidly on until they stood shoulder to shoulder with the police.</p>

  <p class="normal">To the distraught Chinese, bombarded by their own fireworks, the arrival of the soldiers was intolerable. To them it meant that any who tried to escape the burning area were to be shot, and because language between the groups was such a difficult barrier, no one could explain that the soldiers were there merely to halt the spread of infection. There was a way out of Chinatown, and it led to safety, but tempers were growing so violent that it seemed unlikely that this way would ever be found.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re coming at us again!” a corporal cried, as sixteen Chinese prepared for a mass dash through the lines.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t fire!” the captain of that sector shouted. “Don’t you dare fire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What am I supposed to . . .” There was a wild crush. Policemen beat at the pigtailed bodies while soldiers jammed at their bellies with the butts of their guns. The defense line sagged for a moment until volunteer reserves rushed up with boards torn hastily from picket fences. Lustily they clubbed the panicky Chinese over the head, driving them back toward the fire.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can’t hold next time!” the corporal warned, and as if to accent the peril of the moment, a large store of fireworks exploded, adding to the frenzy of all.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you fire!” the captain warned each of his men. “By God, if I go down beneath a bunch of damned Chinks I’m gonna fire!” the corporal shouted, disregarding the cautions of his superior, and it was then apparent that on the next charge from the Chinese a general massacre must surely begin.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment, when the frightened captains were licking their lips and preparing to give the only sensible order they could: “Fire to repel rioters,” Dr. Hewlett Whipple rushed up and shouted, “Let me through! And for Christ’s sake, don’t fire!”</p>

  <p class="normal">He forced his way through the police lines and ran into the middle of the central group of terrified Chinese. Putting his arms about the shoulders of the ringleaders he pleaded:&#160; “Don’t try to break out of here! Don’t run toward the lines again. Please, please!” “You want us die?” a laundryman screamed at him. “We won’t die,” Whipple said as calmly as he could, and something in the unexpected manner in which he said “we” disarmed the Chinese and they listened. “We’re going to run up Nuuanu,” he explained. “We can all get out there.” And pushing the principal rioters before him, he started running up Nuuanu, and the plague-ridden Chinese ran behind him, and in time the riot abated and the trembling young soldiers, wiping their ashen foreheads, returned their guns to safety and marched away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of the Chinese families that were stricken on that awful day of January 20, 1900, when Chinatown was burned—by the will of God, the haoles said; by plan, the Chinese claimed—none was struck so hard as the Kees. When the first kerosene depot exploded, its flames burned down Africa Kee’s office and destroyed his records. A whole barrage of firecrackers ripped through Asia Kee’s restaurant and the resulting fires leveled it. Europe’s Punti store was completely lost and so was America’s dry-goods emporium. Every business building owned by the Kees was burned, including the homes of two of the brothers. Their families escaped with what they wore and little else. Only the cluttered house up Nuuanu was saved, but even its occupants—except Nyuk Tsin, who was working in the forest fields—had been herded into the concentration camps.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Nyuk Tsin came barefooted out of the hills, with her two swaying baskets filled with pineapples, and found that much of Honolulu had been destroyed, including all the possessions of the Kee hui, and when she found that her family was dispersed—many of them dead, she supposed—she experienced a sullen terror, but she fought against it and said, as she stared at her empty home, “I must find my sons.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Fortunately, by force of habit she kept with her the swaying baskets of pineapples, so that when she had climbed the steep sides of Punchbowl and had come to ‘the refugee camp the guards were pleased to see her and shouted, “Thank God, at last a Pake with food!” They let her pass, and after an hour of milling through the crowd she succeeded in collecting four of her five sons. No one had seen Asia leave his restaurant after the firecrackers had ripped it apart and it was reported that he was dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the hillside overlooking Pearl Harbor, where the night lights of distant ships could be seen coming on, Nyuk Tsin convened her dazed family. They sat on rocks and looked down upon the desolate ruins of Chinatown, and in the silence of their crushing defeat Nyuk Tsin’s Hakka instinct warned her that now was the time for her clan to pull courage out of its spasmed belly. As a woman she knew that on such nights of despair men were apt to surrender to the fate that had overtaken them, but it was a woman’s job to prevent them from doing so. In the fading twilight she could see in the sensitive, shocked faces of Europe and America a willingness to declare the Kee empire ended. Blunt-faced Africa showed some of the fighting spirit to be expected in an educated man, but not much, while young Australia was burning with outrage because a soldier had struck him in the gut with a rifle. It was not much of a family that Nyuk Tsin had that night, nor was she herself in condition to inspirit her sons, for inwardly she was grieving for Asia, lost in the fire.</p>

  <p class="normal">But she said quietly, so that no one else could hear, “It is unthinkable that the government will ignore what has happened.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They destroyed all of Chinatown,” America said with anguish in his voice. “They burned our stores on purpose because we wouldn’t work on their sugar plantations.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Nyuk Tsin reasoned, “the wind came by accident.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That isn’t so, Wu Chow’s Auntie!” Europe cried, ugly with despair. “The merchants wanted this done. Last week they threw all the food I had ordered from China into the bay. They were determined to wipe us out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Europe,” Nyuk Tsin calmly argued, “they were afraid your shipments might bring more of the plague.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But they didn’t throw the haole shipments overboard!” Europe shouted, with tears in his voice. “They came from China, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re afraid,” Nyuk Tsin explained. “Men do strange things when they’re afraid.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I never want to see Honolulu again,” America groaned. “They burned our stores on purpose.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Nyuk Tsin patiently reasoned, “they were afraid that . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Auntie!” America cried. “Don’t be a fool!”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a harsh slap in the night and Nyuk Tsin said, “Behave yourself.” Then she drew her sons closer about her and began again: “It is inconceivable that we will be left without compensation. Surely, surely we must believe that the government will pay us for what* has happened.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first time Africa spoke. Cautiously and with the slow accent of a lawyer he asked, “Why do you think so?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I knew Dr. Whipple,” Nyuk Tsin replied. “The old one. And men like him, Africa, simply do not allow injustice to stand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was men like him who burned our stores on purpose,” America whined. There was another harsh slap and Nyuk Tsin cried furiously, “No more words about the past! There was fire. We have lost everything. Now we are going to gain everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Africa’s studious voice asked, “Wu Chow’s Auntie, do you think that men like old Dr. Whipple will be listened to in the days to come?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Perhaps they won’t be,” Nyuk Tsin admitted, “but there is something new in Hawaii. The United States cannot afford to see us treated badly. Out of pride … or to show the world that they look after their people . . .” Her voice trailed off and she reflected for a moment. Then she said vigorously, “Sons, I am absolutely convinced that either our own government or the United States will pay us back for this fire. Let’s not argue about it another minute.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you are thinking of,” Africa said slowly, thinking aloud, “is that we must protect ourselves and see to it that we get our share of whatever money is distributed to those who have lost, regardless of where the money comes from.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin thought: “No matter how much we paid for his education, it was worth it.” And she was also pleased at the way in which Africa’s sensible statement of the problem awakened in her sons their old hui spirit; the Kee hui was again in operation. “I think,” she said, “that Africa must devote his whole time to organizing a committee right away for just payment to all of us who have lost in the fire. Make the world realize that there is no question of whether claims will be paid. It is only a question of how much. Africa, you must appear on every platform. Whenever there is a meeting, you must speak. You must become the voice of all the Chinese. You will represent everybody and you will let it be known that you refuse to accept any fees. Work, work, work. Give statements to the paper and let them print your picture. But always speak as if you were positive that the money will be paid. Soon you will have others saying it, and in time they too will believe it.” She paused, then added, “The money is absolutely going to come.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Europe broke in to ask, “How much can we claim for?” “How many buildings did we have?” America asked. The hui&#160; waited&#160; while&#160; Africa&#160; counted&#160; up&#160; in&#160; his&#160; mind.&#160; “We would have a very substantial claim,” he said finally. “The restaurant, the stores, the houses, my office. The Kee claim could be one of the biggest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Nyuk Tsin interrupted. “Because if that were the case, you could never stand forth as the leader of the claims committee. We will put in some of our claims as Wu Chow’s Auntie. And wherever possible we will claim in the names of your Hawaiian wives. The Kee claim itself must not be large. Africa, it’s your job to see that it isn’t. Use the Chings, anybody, if you have to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Australia made one of the most pregnant observations of the night: “I don’t think I ever want to see Chinatown again. After what they did to it today.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Coldly, yet with compassion for those with less courage than herself, Nyuk Tsin remarked, “There will be many in the next weeks who feel as you do, Australia. Today will be a memory too terrible to accept. They will decide to surrender their land in Chinatown. And if they do, we will buy it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long silence as the brothers looked down at the scarred city, visible now and then through the low clouds of smoke that hung in the valleys. On the ocean beyond, the long surf came rolling in, impartially as it had for millions of years, and the Kee boys somehow understood what their mother was urging them to do. From despair hope rises; from defeat victory. There are only three bad years, followed by six wonderfully rich ones. The city is burned, but it must be rebuilt. The family is nearly destroyed, but if there is one man left alive, or one woman, it must go on. Night falls with the smell of destruction, but day rises with the smell of wet mortar . . . and building resumes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin added: “We must never try to convince any man that he wants to leave Chinatown. We must be careful to drive no unfair bargains. And although we can’t pay much now, we can promise to pay a great deal in the future. Our credit is good. They know a Kee will pay.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin added: “If two pieces of land are for sale, try to buy the one nearest the ones we already own, because stores in the future will be bigger, and we can put our parcels of land together and make each one more valuable than it was before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin added: “Africa, in the last stages of the committee you must insist that you cannot serve on the board that will actually distribute the money. Because if you are on that board, you could not rightfully give substantial amounts to the Kees, but if you are not on it, everyone who is will say, ‘If it hadn’t been for Africa, we wouldn’t be here today.’ And they will be generous on our behalf.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin added: “As I came through the burned areas I saw that the only thing that was left standing anywhere was the iron safes. The haoles will think them no longer of use. Australia, it will be a good job for you to buy them all. Then figure out some way to make them work again.” When her youngest son protested: “Wu Chow’s Auntie, I’ve never worked on safes,” she replied sharply, “Learn.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward daybreak Nyuk Tsin added: “If we succeed, people will hate us for owning so much land and they will say we stole it from people after the fire. Ignore them. A city belongs to those who are willing to fight for it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, Nyuk Tsin added: “I have a little money saved and many vegetables. All of our women and girls must work as servants with haole families, for that will feed the women and also give us money. Europe and America must start to visit every haole store tomorrow, begging for supplies on easy credit so that they can open new stores. Do it tomorrow, while the haoles are sorry for what happened today, for they will give you terms tomorrow that you will not be able to get next week.” She smiled at her four sons and said, “We must work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But at dawn Uliassutai Karakoram Blake puffed up the hillside with a list of names of men who were safe at another camp on the other side of NuuanuRiver, and when he read in loud Chinese syllables: “Asia Kee, who runs the restaurant,” then Nyuk Tsin dropped her head in her hands.</p>
