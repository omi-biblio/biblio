  <h2>V<br/>From the Inland Sea</h2>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THE YEAR</span> 1902, when the reconstruction of Honolulu’s Chinatown was completed, one of the isolated farm villages of Hiroshima-ken, at the southern end of Japan’s main island, stubbornly maintained an ancient courtship custom which everyone knew to be ridiculous but which, perhaps for that very reason, produced good results.</p>

  <p class="normal">When some lusty youth spotted a marriageable girl he did not speak directly to her, nor did he invite any of his friends to do so. Instead, he artfully contrived to present himself before this girl a dozen times a week. She might be coming home from the Shinto shrine under the cryptomeria trees, and suddenly he would appear, silent, moody, tense, like a man who has just seen a ghost. Or, when she returned from the store with a fish, she would unexpectedly see this agitated yet controlled young man staring at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">His part of this strange game required that he never speak, that he share his secret with nobody. Her rules were that not once, by even so much as a flicker of an eye, must she indicate that she knew what he was doing. He loomed silently before her, and she passed uncomprehendingly on. Yet obviously, if she was a prudent girl, she had to find some way to encourage his courtship so that ultimately he might send his parents to the matchmakers, who would launch formal conversations with her parents; for a girl in this village could never tell which of the gloomy, intense young men might develop into a serious suitor; so in some mysterious manner wholly understood by nobody she indicated, without seeing him or without ever having spoken to him, that she was ready.</p>

  <p class="normal">Apart from certain species of the bird kingdom, where courtship was conducted with much the same ritual, this sexual parading was one of the strangest on earth, but in this village of Hiroshima-ken it worked, because it involved one additional step of which I have not yet spoken, and it was this next step that young Sakagawa Kamejiro found himself engaged in.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1902 he was twenty years old, a rugged, barrel-chested, bow-legged little bulldog of a man with dark, unblemished skin and jet-black hair. He had powerful arms which hung out from his body, as if their musculature was too great to be compressed, and he gave the appearance of a five-foot, one-inch accumulation of raw power, bursting with vital drives yet confused because he knew no specific target upon which to discharge them. In other words, Kamejiro was in love.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had fallen in love on the very day that the Sakagawa family council had decided that he should be the one to go on the ship to Hawaii, where jobs in the sugar fields were plentiful. It was not the prospect of leaving home that had aroused his inchoate passions, for he knew that his parents, responsible for eight children and one old woman, could not find enough rice to feed the family. He had observed how infrequently fish got to the Sakagawa table-- and meat not at all--so he was prepared to leave.</p>

  <p class="normal">It happened late one afternoon when he stood in the tiny Sakagawa paddy field and looked out at the shimmering islands of the Inland Sea, and he understood in that brilliant moment, with the westering sun playing upon the most beautiful of all waters, that he might be leaving Hiroshima-ken forever. “I said I would go for only five years,” he muttered stubbornly to himself, “but things can happen. I might never see these islands again. Maybe I won’t plough this field . . . ever again.” And a consuming sorrow possessed him, for all the lands he could imagine, there could be no other on the face of the earth more exciting than these fields along the coastline of Hiroshima-ken.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro was by no charitable interpretation of the word a poet. He was not even literate, nor had he ever looked at picture books. He had never talked much at home, and among the boys of the village he was known to be a stolid fighter rather than a talker. He had always ignored girls and, although he followed his father’s advice on most things, had stubbornly refused to think of marriage. But now, as he stood in the faltering twilight and saw the land of his ancestors for the first time--in history and in passion and in love, as men occasionally perceive the land upon which they have been bred --he wanted brutishly to reach out his hand and halt the descending sun. He wanted to continue his spiritual embrace of the niggardly little field of which he was so much a part. “I may never come back!” he thought. “Look at the sun burning its way into the sea. You would think . . .” He did not put his thoughts into words, but stood in the paddy field, mud about ankles, entertaining tremendous surges of longing. How magnificent his land was!</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in this mood that he started homeward, for in the Japanese custom all rice fields were gathered together while the houses to which they pertained clustered in small villages. Thus arable land was not wasted on housing, but the system did require farmers to walk substantial distances from their fields to their homes, and on this night little bulldog Sakagawa Kamejiro, his arms hanging out with their powerful muscles, walked home. Had he met some man who had earlier insulted him, as often happened in village life, he would surely have thrashed him then and there, for he thought that he wanted to fight; but as he walked he happened to see, at the edge of the village, the girl Yoko, and although he had seen her often before, it was not until then—when she walked with a slight wind at her dress and with a white working-woman’s towel about her head—that he realized how much like the spirit of the land she was, and he experienced an almost uncontrollable desire to pull her off the footpath and into the rice field and have it over with on the spot.</p>

  <p class="normal">Instead, he stood dumb as she approached. His eyes followed her and his big arms quivered, and as she passed she knew that this Kamejiro who was earmarked for Hawaii would watch her constantly throughout the following days, and she began to look for him at strange locations, and he would be there, stolid, staring, his arms hanging awkwardly down. Without ever acknowledging by a single motion of her own that she had even seen him, she conveyed the timeless message of the village: “It would not be unreasonable if you were to do so.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, on a soft spring night when the rice fields were beginning to turn delicate green, the sweet promise of food to come, Sakagawa Kamejiro secretly dressed in the traditional garb of the Hiroshima-ken night lover. He wore his best pair of trousers, his clean straw zori and a shirt that did not smell. The most conspicuous part of his costume, however, was a white cloth mask which wound about his head and covered his nose and mouth. Thus properly attired, he slipped out of the Sakagawa home, down a back path to Yoke’s and waited several hours as her family closed up the day’s business, blew out the lights and threw no more shadows on the shoji. When he was satisfied that Yoko had retired, with a reasonable chance that her parents might be sleeping, he crept toward the room which from long study he had spotted as hers, and in some mysterious way known only in the villages, she had anticipated that this was the night he would visit her, so the shoji had been left unlocked, and in a moment he slipped bemasked into the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yoko saw him in the faint moonlight, but said nothing. Without removing his mask, for that was essential to the custom, he crept to her bed and placed his left hand upon her cheek. Then he took her right hand in his and held her fingers in a certain way, which from the beginning of Japan had meant, “I want to sleep with you,” and of her own accord she changed the position of his fingers, which timelessly had signified, “You may.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With never a word spoken, with never a mask removed, Kamejiro silently slipped into bed with the intoxicating girl. She would not allow him to remove her clothing, for she knew that later she might have to do many things in a hurry, but that did not inconvenience Kamejiro, and in a few stolid, fumbling moments he made her ready to accept him. Not even at the height of their passion did Yoko utter a word, and when they collapsed mutually in blazing gratification and he fell asleep like an animal, she did not touch the mask, for it was there to protect her. At any moment in the love-making she could have pushed him away, and he would have had to go. The next day they could have met on the village street—as they would tomorrow—and neither would have been embarrassed, for so long as the mask was in place, Yoko did not know who was in her room. So long as the mask protected him, Kamejiro could not suffer personal humiliation or loss of face, for no matter what Yoko said or did, it could not embarrass him, for officially he was not there. It was a silly system, this Hiroshima courtship routine, but it worked.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kamejiro wakened, there was a moment when he could not recall where he was, and then he felt Yoko’s body near his and this time they began to caress each other as proper lovers do, and the long night passed, but on the third sweet love-making, when the joy of possession completely captured them, they grew bolder and unwittingly made a good deal of noise, so that Yoko’s father was awakened, and he shouted, “Who’s in the house?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And instantly Yoko was required to scream, “Oh, how horrible! A man is trying to get into my room!” And she continued to wail pitifully as lights flashed on throughout the village.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Some beast is trying to rape Yoko-san!” an old woman screamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must kill him!” Yoko’s father shouted, pulling on his pants.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The family is forever disgraced!” Yoko’s mother moaned, but since each of these phrases had been shouted into the night in precisely these intonations for many centuries, everyone knew exactly how to interpret them. But it was essential for the preservation of family dignity that the entire village combine to seek out the rapist, and now, led by Yoko’s outraged father, the night procession formed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw a man running down this way!” the old woman bellowed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The ugly fiend!” another shouted. “Trying to rape a young girl!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The villagers coursed this way and that, seeking the rapist, but prudently they avoided doing two things: they never took a census of the young men of the village, for by deduction that would have shown who was missing and would have indicated the rapist; nor did they look into the little barn where rice hay was kept, for they knew that the night fiend was certain to be hiding there, and it would be rather embarrassing if he were discovered, for then everyone would have to go through the motions of pretending to beat him.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the hay barn, with chickens cackling, Kamejiro put on his pants, knocked the mud off his zori, and tucked away his white mask. When this was done, he had time to think: “She is sweeter than a breeze off the sea.” But when he saw her later that day, coming from the fish stall, he looked past her and she ignored him, and this was a good thing, for as yet it was not agreed that Yoko would marry him, and if she elected not to do so, it was better if neither of them officially knew who had attempted to rape her. In fact, during that entire day and for some days thereafter Yoko was the acknowledged heroine of the village, for as one old woman pointed out: “I cannot remember a girl who screamed more loudly than Yoko-san while she was defending herself against that awful man . . . whoever he was.” Yoko’s father also came in for considerable praise in that he had dashed through every alley in the village, shouting at the top of his voice, “I’ll kill him!” And farmers said approvingly to their wives, “It was lucky for whoever tried to get into that house that Yoko’s father didn’t catch him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So the last days before the ship’s departure were spent in this make-believe manner. Kamejiro, the object of much admiration because of his willingness to go to Hawaii, worked hard in the family rice field, not because his labor was required, but because he loved the feel of growing rice. Neighbors, whose ancestors had farmed nearby fields for thousands of years, came by to say farewell, and to each he said, “I’ll be back.” And the more he said these words the more he believed that only death would prevent him from returning to the tiny, mountain-shaded, sea-swept fields of Hiroshima-ken.</p>

  <p class="normal">Three or four nights a week he donned his magic mask and climbed more or less surreptitiously into bed with Yoko, and they found each other so completely enjoyable, and so mysterious in the unknowing night, that without ever facing up to the problem, they drifted into a mute understanding that one day they would marry. Kamejiro, finding endless delight in the girl’s soft body, prayed that she might become pregnant, so that he would be forced to marry her before he left for Hawaii, but this was not to be, and as the final week began, he spoke haltingly with his mother.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When I have been in Hawaii for a little while, and after I have sent you a lot of money, I think I may get married.” He blushed a deep red under his dark skin and prepared to confide: “At such time, will you speak to Yoko-chan for me?” But his mother had long waited for this opportunity to advise her favorite son, and now she poured forth her fund of Hiroshima wisdom.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kamejiro, I have heard that it is a terrible thing for a man to travel overseas the way you are doing. Not that you will be robbed, because you are a strong man and able to handle such things as well as any.” She was in her fifties, a small, stoop-shouldered woman with deep wrinkles from endless hours in the sun. She loved rice and could eat four bowls at any meal, but she could never afford to do that, so she remained as skinny as she had been in her youth, when Kamejiro’s father had crept into her sleeping room.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What mothers worry about, Kamejiro,” she explained, “is that their sons will many poorly. Every day that you are gone I shall be anxious, because I shall see you in the arms of some unworthy woman. Kamejiro, you must guard against this. You must not marry carelessly. When it comes time to take a wife, appoint prudent friends to study her history. Now these are the things I want you to bear in mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The best thing in the world is to be a Japanese. What wonderful people the Japanese are. Hard-working, honest, clean people. Kamejiro, your father and I have heard that in Hawaii the people are careless and very dark. If you have to marry one of them . . .” She started to weep, real, mournful tears, so after a while she went to the hanging bucket at the fire and took herself a little rice in a bowl. Thus fortified, she continued. “If you were to marry such a woman, Kamejiro, we would not want you back in this village. You would have disgraced your family, your village, and all Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro listened carefully, for in these matters his mother was wise. She always collected gossip and in the last three weeks had walked fifteen miles to talk with people who had heard various bits of news about Hawaii. “Never marry a Chinese,” she said firmly. “They are clever people and there are many of them in Hawaii, I am told, but they don’t wash themselves as often as we do and no matter how rich they get, they remain Chinese. Under no circumstances can you return to this village if you have a Chinese wife.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kamejiro, many men from Hiroshima-ken are tempted to marry girls from the north. You’ve seen some of those pitiful women down here. They can’t talk decently, and say zu-zu all the time, until you feel ashamed for them. I have no respect at all for girls from the north, and I have never seen one who made a good wife. I will admit that they’re a little better than Chinese, but not much. If you are ever tempted to marry a northern girl, think of Masaru’s wife. Zu-zu, zu-zu! Do you want a girl like that?” she asked contemptuously.</p>

  <p class="normal">Using chopsticks to flick the rice grains into her wrinkled but vigorous mouth she proceeded. “A good many men try wives from the south, too, but what respectable man really wants a Yamaguchi-no-anta? Do you, in your heart, really respect Takeshi-san’s wife? Do you want a woman like that in your home? Would you want to present such a girl to me some day and say, ‘Mother, here is my wife.’ And when I asked where she was from, would you feel satisfied if you had to confess, ‘She’s a Yamaguchi-no-anta’?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the wise old woman came to the most difficult part of her sermon, so once more she fortified herself with a little rice, filling up the bowl with tea and a garnish of dried seaweed. “I would be heartbroken,” she began, “if you married a northern girl or a southern girl, but to tell you the truth I would try to be a very good mother to them, and you would not curse me for my actions. But there are two marriages you may not make, Kamejiro. If you do, don’t bother to come home. You will not be welcome either in the village or in this house or in any part of Hiroshima-ken.” Solemnly she paused, looked out the door to be sure no one was listening, and proceeded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you marry when I am not at hand, Kamejiro, ask your two closest friends to seek out the girl’s history. You know the obvious problems. No disease, no insanity, nobody in jail, all ancestors good, strong Japanese. But then ask your advisers this: ‘Are you sure she is not an Okinawan?’” Dramatically she stopped. Putting down her rice bowl she pointed at her son and said, “Don’t bring an Okinawa girl to this house. If you marry such a girl, you are dead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She waited for this ominous statement to wind its way through her son’s mind, then added, “The danger is this, Kamejiro. In Hiroshima-ken we can spot an Okinawan instantly. I can tell when a girl comes from Okinawa if I see even two inches of her wrist. But in Hawaii I am told people forget how to do this. There are many Okinawans there, and their women set traps to catch decent Japanese. I wish I could go with you to Hawaii, for I can uncover these sly Okinawans. I am afraid you won’t be able to, Kamejiro, and you will bring disgrace upon us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She started to cry again, but rice stanched the tears, and she came to the climax of her warning: “There is of course one problem that every devoted son looks into before he marries, because he owes it not only to his parents but also to his brothers and sisters. Kamejiro, I said that if you married an Okinawa girl you were dead. But if you marry an Eta, you are worse than dead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The wave of disgust that swept over Kamejiro’s face proved that he despised the Eta as much as his mother did, for they were the untouchables of Japan, the unthinkables. In past ages they had dealt in the bodies of dead animals, serving as butchers and leather tanners. Completely outside the scope of Japanese civilization, they scratched out horrible lives in misery and wherever possible fled to distant refuges like Hawaii. A single trace of Eta blood could contaminate an entire family, even to remote unattached cousins, and Kamejiro shuddered.</p>

  <p class="normal">His mother continued dolefully: “I said I could spot an Okinawan, and I could protect you there. But with an Eta … I don’t know. They’re clever! Crawling with evil, they try to make you think they’re normal people. They hide under different names. They take new occupations. I am sure that some of them must have slipped into Hawaii, and how will you know, Kamejiro? What would you do if word sneaked back to Hiroshima-ken that you had been captured by an Eta?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mother and son contemplated this horror for some minutes and she concluded: “So when it comes time to marry, Kamejiro, I think it best if you marry a Hiroshima girl. Now I don’t like girls from Hiroshima City, itself, for they are too fancy. They cost a man money and want their photographs taken all the time. I’ve seen a lot of girls from Hiroshima City, and although I’m ashamed to say so, some of them don’t seem much better than an ordinary Yamaguchi-no-anta. And from what I have seen, a lot of the girls from the other end of Hiroshima-ken aren’t too reliable, either. So don’t be taken in just because a strange girl tells you she’s a Hiroshima-gansu. It may mean nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And be careful not to marry into any family that has ever had an undertaker. Avoid city families if you can. To tell you the truth, Kamejiro, it would be best if you married a girl from right around here. Of course, I don’t think much of the families in Atazuki Village, for they are spendthrift, but I can say there are no finer girls in all Japan than those in our village. So when the time comes to marry, go to a letter-writer and have him send me a message and when it is read to me, I’ll find you a good local girl, and trust me, Kamejiro, that will be best.” She paused dramatically, then added in an offhand manner, “Say, a fine strong girl like Yoko-chan.” Kamejiro looked at his mother and said nothing, so she finished her rice.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it came time for him to bid his parents farewell he assured them that he would never do anything to bring disgrace upon them, or upon Japan. His gruff father warned, “Don’t bring home an Okinawan or an Eta.” His mother summarized a larger body of Hiroshima morality by reminding him, “No matter where you go, Kamejiro, remember that you are Japanese. Put strength in your stomach and be a good Japanese. Never forget that some day you will return to Hiroshima-ken, the proudest and greatest in all Japan. Come home with honor, or don’t come home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then his father led him to one side and said quietly, “Be proud. Be Japanese. Put power in your stomach.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As he set forth from the village he saw by the shrine the flowering girl Yoko-san and he wanted to leave his weeping parents and rush over to her, shouting, “Yoko-chan! ,When I have made money I will send for you!” But his stocky legs were powerless to move him in that direction, and had he gone his voice would have been unable to speak, for officially they did not know each other, and all the exciting things that had transpired behind the darkened shoji had not really happened, for he had never removed his mask.</p>

  <p class="normal">So he departed, a tough, stalwart little man with arms hanging down like loaded buckets, yet as he passed the shrine, looking straight ahead, he somehow received Yoke’s assurance that if he cared to write for her, she would come; and a considerable happiness accompanied him on his journey.</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first two miles his path lay along the Inland Sea, and he saw before him the shifting panorama of that wonderland of islands. Green and blue and rocky brown they rose from the cool waters, lifting their pine trees to the heavens. On one a bold crimson torii rose like a bird of god, marking some ancient Shinto shrine. On others Kamejiro saw the stained stone outlines of Buddhist temples, perched above the sea. How marvelous that footpath was! How the earth sang, while the rice fields swept their ripening grain back and forth in the winds creeping inland from the sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">With every step Kamejiro encountered some unexpected beauty, for he was traversing one of the most glorious paths in the world, and the singing of that day would never leave his ears. Once he stopped to stare in wonder at the multitude of islands and at the magnificence of their position within the sea, and he swore, “A little time will pass and I will return to the Inland Sea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Kyoto-maru landed him in Honolulu he advised the immigration interpreter: “Stamp my paper for five years.” Fortunately, he could not understand the official when the latter muttered to his assistant, ‘‘I wish I believed these little yellow bastards were gonna stay only five years.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There were others in Hawaii, however, who welcomed the Japanese ungrudgingly, for that day the Honolulu Mail editorialized: “Janders &amp; Whipple are to be congratulated on having completed plans for the importation of 1,850 strong and healthy Japanese peasant farmers to work our sugar fields, with prospects for as many more at later intervals as may be required. We journeyed to the Kyoto-maru yesterday to inspect the new arrivals and can report that they seemed a sturdy lot. Lunas who have worked earlier crews of Japanese state unanimously that they are much superior to the unfortunate Chinese whom they are replacing. They are obedient, extraordinarily clean, law-abiding, not given to gambling and eager to accomplish at least eighty per cent more honest labor than the lazy Chinese ever did.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Japanese avoid the Chinaman’s tendency to combine into small and vicious groups. Themselves an agrarian people, they love plantation work and will stay in the fields, so that the trickery whereby in recent years crafty Orientals fled from honest work in the cane fields, so as to monopolize our city shops, can be expected to end. Japanese are notoriously averse to running stores, but J &amp; W have taken the added precaution of importing only strong young men from rural areas. There are no wily Tokyo dwellers lurking ominously in their gangs. Plantation owners can expect a rapid improvement in the appearance of their camps, too, for Japanese love to garden and will soon have their buildings looking attractive.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In two respects we are particularly fortunate in getting these Japanese. First, we have been assured that their men do not contract alliances with women of any other race but their own, and we can look forward confidently to a cessation of the disgraceful scenes of aging Oriental men marrying the best young Hawaiian girls of our islands. Secondly, because of the feudal structure of Japanese society, in which every Japanese is loyal unto the death to his master, firms like J &amp; W are going to find that their new laborers will probably be the most loyal available on earth. Lunas who have worked them say they love authority, expect to be told what to do, respond promptly to crisp if not abusive treatment, and are accustomed to smart blows from time to time when their work is not-up to par. Unlike their Chinese cousins, they neither resent honest correction nor combine secretly against those who administer it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All in all, we think that future history will show that the true prosperity of Hawaii began with the importation of these sturdy workmen, and when, at the end of their employment, they return to Japan, each with his pocketful of honestly earned gold, they will go with our warm aloha. Today we welcome them as fortunate replacements for the Chinese who have turned out so badly. Aloha nui nui!”</p>

  <p class="normal">OF <span>THE</span> 1,850 Japanese laborers who debarked that September day in 1902, most were assigned to plantations on Oahu, the island that contained Honolulu, and they were depressed by the barren ugliness of the inland areas. They had not seen cactus before, but as farmers they could guess that it spoke ill of the land upon which it grew, and the dull red dust appalled them. They judged that no water came to these parts, and although they had not themselves grown cattle, they could see that the spavined beasts which roamed these desolate acres suffered from both thirst and hunger. They were disappointed in the parched land which showed so little promise, and one farmer whispered to his friends, “America is much different from what they said.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Kamejiro Sakagawa was not to be disappointed, for he was among a batch of workers dispatched to another area, and when he reached it he saw immediately that his new land was among the fairest on earth. Even the glorious fields along the Inland Sea of Japan were no finer than the area which he was expected to till. To reach this veritable paradise young Kamejiro was not marched along the dusty roads of Oahu; he was led onto a small inter-island boat which at other times was used for the ‘transport of lepers, and after a long, seasick night, he was marched ashore on the island of Kauai. At the pier a tall, scar-faced man waited impatiently on a horse, and when the captain of the boat was inept at docking, he shouted orders of his own, as if he were in command. At his side ran a little Japanese, and as his countrymen finally climbed down out of the boat, this interpreter told them, “The man on the horse is called Wild Whip Hoxworth. If you work good, he is good. If not, he will beat you over the head. So work good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As he spoke Wild Whip wheeled his horse among the men, reached down with his riding crop and tilted upward the face of Kamejiro Sakagawa. “You understand?” he growled. The little interpreter asked, “Ano hito ga yutta koto wakari mashita ka?” When stocky Kamejiro nodded, Whip lowered the riding crop, reached down and patted the new laborer on the shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he wheeled his horse about and moved into position at the head of the line. “We march!” he shouted, leading them off the pier onto a red-baked road where a group of sugar-cane wagons, hitched to horses, waited. “Climb in!” he yelled, and as the Japanese crawled into the low wagons whose sides were formed of high stakes bound together by lengths of rope, he moved to the head of the train and shouted, “On to Hanakai!” And the procession left the port town and moved slowly northward along the eastern coast of the island.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the men rode they saw for the first time the full grandeur of Hawaii, for they were to work on one of the fairest islands in the Pacific. To the left rose jagged and soaring mountains, clothed in perpetual green. Born millions of years before the other mountains of Hawaii, these had eroded first and now possessed unique forms that pleased the eye. At one point the wind had cut a complete tunnel through the highest mountain; at others the erosion of softer rock had left isolated spires of basalt standing like monitors. To the right unfolded a majestic shore, out by deep bays and highlighted by a rolling surf that broke endlessly upon dark rocks and brilliant white sand. Each mile disclosed to Kamejiro and his companions some striking new scene.</p>

  <p class="normal">But most memorable of all he saw that day was the red earth. Down millions of years the volcanic eruptions of Kauai had spewed forth layers of iron-rich rocks, and for subsequent millions of years this iron had slowly, imperceptibly disintegrated until it now stood like gigantic piles of scintillating rust, the famous red earth of Kauai. Sometimes a green-clad mountain would show a gaping scar where the side of a cliff had fallen away, disclosing earth as red as new blood. At other times the fields along which the men rode would be an unblemished furnace-red, as if flame had just left it. Again in some deep valley where small amounts of black earth had intruded, the resulting red nearly resembled a brick color. But always the soil was red. It shone in a hundred different hues, but it was loveliest when it stood out against the rich green verdure of the island, for then the two colors complemented each other, and Kauai seemed to merit the name by which it was affectionately known: the Garden Island.</p>

  <p class="normal">For out of its lush red soil, teeming with iron, grew a multitude of trees: palms that clung to the shore; pandanus that twisted itself into dense jungle; banyans with their thousand aerial roots; hau and kou, the excellent trees of the islands; swift-growing wild plum that had been imported from Japan to provide burning fagots for the laborers; and here and there a royal palm, its moss-pocked trunk rising majestically toward the heavens. But there was one tree specially dedicated to Kauai, and it made both life and agriculture on the island possible. Wherever the powerful northeast trades whipped sea and salt air inland, killing everything that grew, men had planted the strange, silky, gray-green casuarina tree, known sometimes as the ironwood. Groves of this curious tree, covered with ten-inch needles and seed cones that resembled round buttons, stood along the shore and protected the island. The foliage of the casuarina was not copious and to the stranger each tree looked so frail that it seemed about to die, but it possessed incredible powers of recuperation, and what it thrived on most was a harsh, salty trade wind that whipped its fragile needles into a frenzy and tore at its cherry-bark trunk; for then the casuarina dug in and saved the island. The sea winds howled through its branches; its frail needles caught the salt; the force of the storm was broken and all who lived in the shadow of the casuarina tree lived securely.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the Japanese rode through this verdant wonderland, a storm flashed in from the sea, throwing tubs of water over the land, but Wild Whip, holding his prancing horse under control, shouted to his interpreter, “Ishii-san, tell the men that on Kauai we don’t run from storms!” The frail little interpreter ran from wagon to wagon, shouting, “On this island it rains a dozen times a day. Soon the sun comes out. We never bother.” And as he predicted, after a few minutes the wild storm moved on to sulk in a valley until a rainbow was flung across it, and it was toward this rainbow that Kamejiro and his companions rode.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had come to the valley of Hanakai, the Valley of the Sea, but they were not yet aware of that fact, for the highway upon which they rode was at this point more than a mile inland; but leading off from it, to the right and toward the sea, appeared a spectacular lane. It was marked by twenty pairs of royal palms, gray-trunked and erect, that Whip had sent home from Madagascar on one of the H &amp; H ships, and these magnificent sentinels guarded the road as stone lions had once stood watch for the Assyrians. Entering the deep shade of the lane, the workmen sensed that they were approaching something special, and after a while they came upon twenty pairs of Norfolk pine, those exalted sculptural trees that had originally grown on only one South Pacific island, from which Whip had some years ago recovered two hundred young trees which he had scattered throughout Hawaii. Beyond them came the beauty of the Hoxworth lane: to the left and north stood an unbroken line of croton bushes imported by Whip from Guadalcanal in the Solomons, and of all that grew on his plantations, these were his favorites, these low sparkling bushes whose iridescent green and red and purple and gold and blue leaves were a constant source of wonder; but to the right ran a long row of hibiscus trees, low shrublike plants that produced a dozen varieties of fragile, crepelike flowers, each with its own dazzling color; Whip’s favorite was the bright yellow hibiscus, bigger than a large plate and golden in the sunlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">The lane now turned sharply south and entered upon a huge grassy area. As was the custom in Hawaii at that time, no specific roadway led up to the Hoxworth mansion. Over the spacious lawn, guests drove as they wished, for no matter how badly the grass was scarred by such usage, the next day’s inevitable rain and sunlight cured it. On the lawn there were only two trees. To the right stood an African tulip tree with dark green leaves and brilliant red flowers scattered prodigally upon it, while to the left rose one of the strangest trees in nature, the golden tree which Whip had found in South America. Each year it produced a myriad of brilliant yellow flowers, and since it stood some fifty feet high, it was a spectacular exhibit.</p>

  <p class="normal">The house was long and low, built originally in China of the best wood, then taken apart and shipped in an H &amp; H cargo ship to Hanakai. It ran from northeast to southwest, and its southern exposure consisted of eight tall Greek pillars supporting a porch upon which the life of the mansion took place. For at Hanakai the view from the lanai—the open porch—commanded attention. A soft green grassy lawn fell away to the edge of a steep cliff some three hundred feet above the surface of the sea, which here cut deeply inland forming the bay of Hanakai. When a storm of major proportions fell upon Kauai, the wild ocean would sweep its penetrating arm into the bay and find itself impounded. Then it would leap like a caged animal high up the sides of the red cliff. Its topmost spray would poise there for a moment, then fall screaming down the sheer sides. To see such a storm at Hanakai was to see the ocean at its best. But to the north and east, from where the storms blew, there was a row of trees, not visible from the mansion, and it was upon these that the life of Hanakai depended, for they were the casuarina trees, and it was their needles that sifted out the salt and broke the back of the wild storm; they were the speechless, sighing workmen, and if the golden tree was the marvel of that part of Kauai, it existed solely because the casuarinas fought the storms on its behalf.</p>

  <p class="normal">Within the protection of the casuarinas Wild Whip paused to review the beauty of his favorite spot in the islands. It had been given him by his doting grandfather, Captain Rafer Hoxworth, who had got it from the Alii Nui Noelani, and here Whip had brought his treasures from around the world. Hawaii’s best mangoes grew at Hanakai, its most brilliant hibiscus and its best horses. As Whip now studied the red earth and heard the ocean growling at the cliffs he muttered, “Lucky Japanese who came here to work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro and his fellow laborers did not, of course, accompany Whip to the mansion. At the end of the lane Mr. Ishii, the interpreter, took them off in quite the opposite direction, toward the casuarina trees, and after half a mile he brought them to a long low wooden building consisting of a single room. It contained three doors, a few windows, half a dozen tables and some sagging wooden beds. Outside were two unspeakably foul toilets with a well between. There were no trees, no flowers, no amenities of any kind, but there was a copious amount of red mud, a thicket of wild plum from which firewood could be cut, and in all directions the green wilderness of growing sugar canes. This was the Ishii Camp, so known because of the interpreter who ran it.</p>

  <p class="normal">In this particular camp, there were no women, no facilities for recreation, no doctor, and no church. There was lots of rice, for Wild Whip insisted that his men be fed well, and in each camp—for this was merely one of seven on Hanakai Plantation—one man was appointed fisherman, bringing to the table whatever he caught on the fruitful reefs of Kauai. It was Whip Hoxworth’s full intention that any laborer whom he imported should work for him five or ten years, save his money, and return to Japan. There was thus no need for women or churches, and little need for doctors, since he hired only the ablest-bodied.</p>

  <p class="normal">At Hanakai the Hoxworth laborers rose at four in the morning, ate a hot breakfast, hiked to the fields so as to be there at six and worked till six at night, hiking back to the Ishii Camp on their own time. For this they were paid sixty-seven cents a day, but they did get their food and a sagging bed. During harvest, of course, they worked nineteen hours a day for no extra money.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the first workday Kamejiro Sakagawa marched home at dusk, feeling great strength in his bones, and looked about for some place in which to bathe, for like all Japanese he was fanatic in his attention to cleanliness, and he was dismayed to find that no provisions had been made. Water could be pumped from the well, but who could bathe properly in cold water? On this first night he had to make do, protestingly, and he listened to his mates growling as they recalled the sweet hot baths of Hiroshima, and that night he went to see Ishii-san and said, “I think I will build a hot bath for the camp.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s no lumber,” Ishii-san said. It was his job to protect the interests of Mr. Hoxworth and he did so.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw some old boards at the edge of the sugar field,” Kamejiro replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You can have them, but there are no nails,” Ishii-san warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw some nails where the irrigation ditch was mended.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were they rusted?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You can have them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On his second full day ashore in Hawaii, Kamejiro began building his hot bath. It was most tedious work, for he could not find lumber that fitted nor could he get hold of a piece of galvanized iron for the bottom, where the fire was to be built. At last he grabbed Ishii-san, who was skittish about the whole affair, and made the interpreter speak to Mr. Hoxworth--Hoxwurtu, the Japanese men called him --and the tall boss growled, “What do you want galvanized iron for?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To take a bath,” Kamejiro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Use cold water. I do,” Hoxworth snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t!” Kamejiro snapped back, and Hoxworth turned in his saddle to study the runty little man with the long arms that hung out from his body.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t speak to me that way,” Hoxworth said ominously, pointing his riding crop at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have to be clean,” Kamejiro insisted, not drawing away from the crop.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have to work,” Hoxworth said slowly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But after work we want to be clean,” Kamejiro said forcefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you looking for a fight?” Hoxworth cried, dropping from his horse and throwing the reins to an attendant. Ishii-san, the interpreter, began to sweat and mumbled his words, replying on behalf of Kamejiro, “Oh, no, sir! This man is a fine workman!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shut up!” Hoxworth snapped, pushing his little assistant aside. Striding up to Kamejiro he started to grab him by the shoulders, but as he did so he saw the enormous musculature of the stubborn workman, and he saw also that Kamejiro had no intention of allowing even the boss to touch him, and the two men stood in the cane field staring at each other. The other Japanese were terrified lest trouble start, but Kamejiro, to his surprise, was unconcerned, for he was studying the big American and thinking: “If he comes one step closer I will ram my head into his soft belly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In mutual respect the tension dissolved, and Wild Whip asked Ishii-san, “What is it he wants?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s building a bath for the camp,” Ishii repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what I don’t understand,” Hoxworth replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Japanese cannot live unless they have a bath each day,” Kamejiro explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Pump the water and take a bath,” Whip said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A hot bath,” Kamejiro replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">For a long moment the two men stared at each other, after which Whip laughed easily and asked, “So you’ve got to have some corrugated iron?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Kamejiro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll get it,” Hoxworth replied. As if they were boys playing, Whip winked at Kamejiro, and chucked him under the chin with the whip. With one finger the Japanese laborer slowly moved the crop away, and the two men understood each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the bath was built, a square tub four feet deep on stilts, Kamejiro rigged a triple length of bamboo which delivered water from the pump. Beneath the galvanized iron he built a fire with wild plum branches, and when the water was hot he clanged a piece of iron to summon the camp. Each man stripped, hung his clothes on a pole spiked with nails, and was allowed one panful of hot water with which to soap down outside the tub and rinse off. Then, mounting three wooden steps, he climbed into the steaming water and luxuriated for four minutes. While he was doing this, the next man was cleansing himself, and as the first crawled out reluctantly, the second climbed in eagerly. Kamejiro tended the fire and added new water as it was needed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first ten men to use the water paid a penny each, and cast lots to determine who had the right to climb in first. After the first ten, each man paid half a cent, and as many as wished used the water. Long after night had fallen, when the pennies were safely stowed away and the other men were eating their evening meal, Kamejiro himself would undress, place one more stick under the iron—for he liked his bath hotter than most—and after carefully soaping himself outside and washing off, he would climb into the remnants of the water. Its heat would encompass him and make him forget Hiroshima and the difficulties of the day. To the east the casuarina trees kept away the storm, and in the hot bath all was well.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he returned to his bunk he invariably looked with deep respect at his only significant possession, the black-framed portrait of the Japanese emperor. Before this grim and bearded leader the little workman bowed; the one reality in his life was that the emperor personally knew of his daily behavior and was grieved when things went poorly. Each night before he went to sleep he weighed his day’s actions and hoped that the emperor would approve.</p>

  <p class="normal">In order to collect the firewood needed for the hot bath, Kamejiro rose at three-thirty each morning and worked while the others were eating. When the wood was safely stored, he grabbed two rice balls, a bit of pickle and part of a fish, munching them as he ran to the fields. At six, when the day’s work ended, he dashed home ahead of the rest to get the fire started, and was not free to eat until the last bath had been taken. Then he accepted what was left and in this way he saved the money for the important step he was to take thirteen years later in 1915.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not easy to accumulate money, not even when one worked as hard as Kamejiro did. For example, in 1904 events transpired in Asia which were to eat up his savings, but no man worthy of the name would have done less than he did under the circumstances. For some months Japan had been having trouble with Russia, and the emperor’s divine word to his people had reached even remote Kauai, where with trembling voice Ishii-san had read the prescript to all the assembled Japanese: “As it is Our heartfelt desire to maintain the peace of the East, We have caused Our government to negotiate with Russia, but We are now compelled to conclude that the Russian government has no sincere desire to maintain the peace of the East. We have therefore ordered Our government to break off negotiations with Russia and have decided to take free action for the maintenance of Our independence and self-protection.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What does it mean?” Kamejiro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“War,” an older man explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Ishii-san’s voice rose to an awed climax as he delivered the distant emperor’s specific message to all loyal Japanese: “We rely upon your loyalty and valor to carry out Our object and thereby keep unsullied the honor of our Empire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Banzai!” a former soldier shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Japan must win!” the workmen began to cry.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ishii-san waited for the tumult to die down, then announced: “On Friday an officer of the emperor himself will come to Hanakai to collect money for the Imperial army. Let us show the world what loyal Japanese we are!” He hesitated a moment, then announced: “I will give eleven dollars.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A gasp went up from the crowd as men realized how much of his meager salary this represented, and another was inspired to cry, “I will give nineteen dollars.” The crowd applauded, and as the ante rose, Kamejiro was swept up by the fervor of the moment. Japan was in danger. He could see his parents’ fields overrun by Russian barbarians, and he thought how insignificant were his savings from the hot bath. In an ecstasy of emotion, seeing the grave, bearded emperor before him, he rose and cried in a roaring voice, “I will give all my bath money! Seventy-seven dollars.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A mighty cheer went up, and a Buddhist priest said, “Let us in our hearts resolve to protect the honor of Japan as Sakagawa Kamejiro has done this day.” Men wept and songs were sung and Ishii-san shouted in his high, weak voice, “Let every man march by and swear allegiance to the emperor.” Instinctively the workmen formed in orderly ranks and fell into martial rhythms as they marched past the place where the Buddhist priest stood. Pressing their hands rigidly to their knees, they bowed as if to the august presence itself and said, “Banzai! Banzai!”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the excitement was over, and the emperor’s emissary had left with the money, the camp settled down to the agony of waiting for war news. It was rumored that Russian troops had landed on the island of Kyushu, and Kamejiro whispered to Ishii-san at night, “Should we return to Honolulu and try to find a boat back to Japan?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Ishii said gravely. “After all, what we have heard is only a rumor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Japan is in danger!” Kamejiro muttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must wait for more substantial news,” Ishii-san insisted, and because he could read and write, people listened to him. And the year 1904 ended in apprehension.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in January, 1905, his prudence was rewarded when word reached Kauai that the great Russian bastion at Port Arthur had surrendered to a Japanese siege. Kauai--that is, the Japanese living there --went wild with joy and a torchlight procession was held through the plantation town of Kapaa; and the celebrations had hardly ended when word came of an even more astonishing victory at Mukden, followed quickly by the climactic news from the Strait of Tsushima. A Russian fleet of thirty-eight major vessels had engaged the Japanese under Admiral Togo; nineteen were immediately sunk, five were captured, and of the remaining fourteen, only three got back to Russia. More than 10,000 of the enemy were drowned and 6,000 taken prisoner. For their part, the Japanese lost only three minor torpedo boats and less than 700 men. The Honolulu Mail called Tsushima “one of the most complete victories any nation has ever enjoyed at the expense of a major rival.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro, listening to the stunning news, burst into tears and told his friend Ishii-san, “I feel as if my hot-bath money had personally sunk the Russian ships.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It did,” Ishii-san assured him. “Because it represented the undying spirit of the Japanese. Look at the poor Americans! Their president speaks to them, and nothing happens. No one pays attention. But when the emperor speaks to us, we hear even though we are lost at the end of the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro contemplated this for a moment, then asked, “Ishii-san, do you feel proud today?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I feel as if my heart were a. balloon carrying me above the trees,” Ishii-san replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can feel guns going off in my chest every minute,” Kamejiro confided. “They are the guns of Admiral Togo.” Again tears came into his eyes and he asked, “Ishii-san, do you think it would be proper for us to say a prayer for that great admiral who saved Japan?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It would be better if the priest were here. That’s his job.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But wouldn’t it be all right if we ourselves faced Japan and said a prayer?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would like to do so,” Ishii-san admitted, and the two laborers knelt in the red dust of Kauai and each thought of Hiroshima, and the rice fields, and the red torii looking out over the Japan Sea, and they prayed that their courageous country might always know victory.</p>

  <p class="normal">By this time Kamejiro had saved, from his wages and the hot bath, an additional thirty-eight dollars, and the camp suspected this, so when word reached Kauai that a splendid victory celebration was to be held right in the heart of Honolulu, for all Hawaii to see, and that the island of Kauai was invited to send two men to march in Japanese uniforms and play the roles of immortal military leaders like Admiral Togo, everyone agreed that Kamejiro should be one of the men, because he could pay his own way, and a man named Hashimoto was the other, because he also had some savings, and in late May, 1905, the two stocky laborers set out on the inter-island boat Kilauea for Honolulu. There the committee provided them with handsome uniforms which local Japanese wives had copied from magazine pictures, and Kamejiro found himself a full colonel in memory of a leader who had personally thrown himself upon the Russian guns at the siege of Fort Arthur. This Colonel Ito had been blown to pieces and into national immortality. It was with bursting pride that Colonel Sakagawa lined up on the afternoon of June 2, 1905, to march boldly through the streets of Honolulu and across the Nuuanu to Aala Park, where thousands of Japanese formed a procession that proceeded solemnly to the Japanese consulate, where a dignified man in frock coat and black tie nodded gravely. A workman from one of the Janders &amp; Whipple plantations on Oahu was dressed in Admiral Togo’s uniform, and from the steps of the consulate he led the Banzai and the formal marching broke up. Kamejiro and his fellow Kauai man, Hashimoto, walked back to Aala Park, where exhibitions of Japanese wrestling and fencing were offered to an appreciative crowd; but the victory celebration was to have overtones of another kind which Kamejiro would never forget, for at ten o’clock, when the crowd was greatest, a pathway was formed and eight professional geisha girls from one of the tea houses passed through the confusion to take their places on the dancing platform, and as they went one walked in her gently swaying manner quite close to Kamejiro and the powder in her hair brushed into his nostrils and he admitted, for the first time in three years, how desperately hungry he was for that girl Yoko back in Hiroshima.</p>

  <p class="normal">A haze came over his eyes and he imagined that the mask was once more upon his face while he prepared to slip into her sleeping room. He could feel her arms about him and hear her voice in his ear. The crowd pressed in upon him but he was not part of it; he was in Hiroshima in the spring when the rice fields were a soft green, and a horrible thought took possession of him: “I shall never leave Kauai! I shall die here and never see Japan again! I shall live all my life without a woman!”</p>

  <p class="normal">And he began, in his agony, to walk among the crowd and place himself so that he might touch this Japanese wife or that. He did not grab at them or embarrass them; he wanted merely to see them and to feel their reality; and his glazed eyes stared at them. “I am so hungry,” he muttered to himself as he moved so as to intercept a woman at least twenty years older than he. She shuffled along with her feet never leaving the ground, Japanese style, and the soft rustle of her passing seemed to him one of the sweetest sounds he had ever heard. Instinctively he reached out his hand and clutched at her arm, and the shuffling stopped. The housewife looked at him in amazement, pushed his hand down, and muttered, “You are a Japanese! Behave yourself! Especially when you wear such a uniform!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mortified, he fled the crowd and found Hashimoto, who said abruptly, “Those damned geisha girls are driving me loony. Let’s find a good whorehouse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two Kauai laborers started probing the Aala region, but a stranger told them, “The houses you want are all in Iwilei,” so they hurried to that quarter of the city, but the houses were filled with richer patrons and the two could gain no entrance.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m going to grab any woman I see,” Hashimoto said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Kamejiro warned, remembering the admonition of the woman he had touched.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To hell with you!” the other shouted. “Girl! Girls!” he shouted in Japanese. “Here I come to find you!” And he dashed down one of the Iwilei alleys. Kamejiro, now ashamed to be in such a place while dressed as Colonel Ito, who had sacrificed his life at Port Arthur, fled the area and returned to the park, where he sat for hours staring at the dancers. This time he kept away from women, and after a long time an old Japanese man came up to him with a bottle of sake and said, “Oh, Colonel! What a glorious war this was! And did you notice one thing tonight? Not one damned Chinese had the courage to appear on the streets while our army was marching! I tell you, Colonel! In 1895 we defeated the Chinese. And in 1905 we defeated the Russians. Two of the finest nations on earth. Who will we fight ten years from now? England? Germany?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All the world can be proud of Japan,” Kamejiro agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is more important, Colonel,” the drunk continued, “is that here in Hawaii people have now got to respect us. The German lunas who beat us with whips. The Norwegian lunas who treat us with contempt. They have got to respect us Japanese! We are a great people! Therefore, Colonel, promise me one thing, and I will give you more sake. The next time a European luna dares to strike you in the cane fields, kill him! We Japanese will show the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a tremendous celebration, worthy of the impressive victory gained by the homeland, and even though it used up much of Kamejiro’s savings and reminded him of how lonely he was, he felt it had been worth while; but it had one unfortunate repercussion which no one could have foreseen, and long after the celebration itself had faded into memory, this one dreadful result lived on in Kamejiro’s mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">It started in the whorehouses of Iwilei, after Kamejiro had abandoned his lusty friend Hashimoto to the alleys, for that young man had forced his way into one of the houses and had been soundly thrashed by half a dozen Germans who resented his intrusion. Thrown into one of the gutters, he had been found by a Hawaiian boy who did pimping for a group of girls, and this boy, in the custom of the islands, had lugged the bewildered Japanese home, where his sister had washed his bruises. They had been able to converse only in pidgin, but apparently enough ‘had been said, for when Hashimoto returned to the Kauai ship, he had the sister in tow. She was a big, amiable, wide-eyed Hawaiian who carried with her only one bundle tied with string, but she seemed to like wiry, tough-minded Hashimoto and apparently intended to stay with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to marry her,” Hashimoto stoutly informed Kamejiro, who still wore his colonel’s uniform, and something about either the victory celebration or the uniform made Kamejiro especially patriotic that day, for as soon as his friend said the fatal words, “I am going to marry her,” he sprang into action as if he were in charge of troops. Grabbing Hashimoto by the arm he warned, “If you do such a thing, all Japan will be ashamed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I may not ever go back to Japan,” Hashimoto said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Impulsively, like a true colonel, Kamejiro struck Hashimoto across the face, shouting, “Don’t ever speak like that! Japan is your home!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hashimoto was astonished at Colonel Sakagawa’s unexpected behavior but he recognized that he deserved the rebuke, so he mumbled, “I’m tired of living without a woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This introduced a less military note into the discussion, and Kamejiro quit being an Imperial colonel and became once more a friend. “Hashimoto-san, it was bad enough to go to such a house, but to bring home one of the girls, and to marry her! You must put strength in your stomach and be a decent Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She isn’t from one of the houses,” Hashimoto explained. “She’s a good girl from a good hard-working family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But she’s not Japanese!” Kamejiro argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">He made no progress with Hashimoto, who was determined not to live alone any longer. Since there were no Japanese girls available on Kauai, he would live with his Hawaiian and marry her. But in his ardor for feminine companionship he had failed to consider the even greater ardor of the Japanese community, and when it was noised abroad what he had done, he experienced the full, terrible power of the sacred Japanese spirit.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have sullied the name of Japan,” warned the older men, who had learned to live without women.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have disgraced the blood of Japan,” others mourned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you no pride, no Yamato spirit?” younger men asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you realize that you bring disgrace upon us all?” his friends pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hashimoto proved himself to be a man of fortitude. “I will not live alone any longer,” he repeated stubbornly. “I am going to live with my wife, the way a man should.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you will live forever apart from the Japanese community,” a stern old man cried. He had been in Kauai for many years, also longing for a woman, but he had behaved himself as a decent Japanese should, and now on behalf of all the emperor’s subjects he pronounced the ostracism: “Because you have been shameless, and because you have not protected the sacred blood of Japan, you must live apart. We don’t want a man like you to work with us or to eat with us or to live with us. Get out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hashimoto began to feel the awful force of this sentence, and pleaded, “But a man needs a woman! What do you expect me to do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">A fiery younger man replaced the one who had delivered the ostracism, and this one shouted belligerently, “We don’t expect you to marry other women! You’re no Chinese who is willing to marry anybody he can get his hands on. You’re a Japanese!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What am I to do?” Hashimoto screamed. “Live alone all my life?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Use the prostitutes each month, like we do,” the fiery young man cried, referring to the girls which the plantation bosses provided on paydays, moving them from camp to camp according to schedule.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the time comes when a man doesn’t want prostitutes any longer,” Hashimoto pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then live without them,” an older man snapped. “Like Akagi-san. Eh, you Akagi-san? How many years you live without a woman?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nineteen,” a wiry veteran of the cane fields replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you, Yamasaki-san?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Seventeen,” a sunburned Hiroshima man replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re decent, honest Japanese!” the younger man shouted. “They will wait here till they die, hoping for a Japanese wife, but if none arrives they would not think of marrying anyone else. In them the Japanese spirit is high. In you, Hashimoto, there is no honor. Now get out!”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Hashimoto left Ishii Camp and lived with his Hawaiian wife in the town of Kapaa. He had to be fired by Hanakai Plantation, for other Japanese refused to work with an outcast who had sullied the blood of Japan. Sometimes when men from the camp went into Kapaa to play a little pool or get drunk on okolehau, a potent illegal brew made from the root of the ti plant, they would meet their former friend Hashimoto, but they never spoke. He could not attend the Japanese church, nor any of the socials, nor play in Japanese games, nor listen to the heroic reciters who came from time to time from Tokyo, spending days among the camps, reciting the glories of Japanese history.</p>

  <p class="normal">From all such normal intercourse Hashimoto was excluded, and although the dreadful example of his banishment was frequently recalled by other young men who may have wanted women and who were certainly tempted to marry Hawaiian or Chinese or drifting white girls, his proscribed name was never mentioned. Men hungry for girls did not warn each other: “Remember what happened to Hashimoto!” Instinctively they remembered, for of him it had once been said: “All Japan will be ashamed of what you have done.” And the young men were convinced that throughout every village of Japan the evil word had been passed: “Hashimoto Sutekichi married a Hawaiian woman and all Japan is ashamed of him.” What Honolulu thought of the marriage was unimportant, for Honolulu did not matter, but what Japan thought was of towering concern, for every man in Ishii Camp intended one day to return to Japan; and to take back with him any wife other than a decent Japanese was unthinkable.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>THE YEARS</span> following annexation had not been kind to Wild Whip Hoxworth. In business the more stodgy members of Hoxworth &amp; Hale had kept him from assuming any position of leadership within the company, so that even though his sugar lands irrigated by artesian wells flourished and made him a millionaire several times over, he was denied for moral reasons the command of H &amp; H to which his talents entitled him. So he had come to Kauai.</p>

  <p class="normal">With driving energy he had imported hundreds of Japanese laborers and had built irrigation ditches, cleared land, and shown Kauai how to grow sugar by the most improved methods. He had erected his own mill and ground his own cane, filling the stubby cargo ships of the H &amp; H line with his product.</p>

  <p class="normal">With equal energy he had built the mansion at Hanakai, personally placing the croton bushes and the hibiscus. When the cut timbers arrived from China he supervised their erection, and it was he who added the idea of a broad area covered by flagstone through whose chinks grass grew, so that one walked both on the firmness of stone and the softness of grass. When he finished he had a magnificent house, perched on the edge of a precipice at whose feet the ocean thundered, but it was a house that knew no happiness, for shortly after Whip had moved in with his third wife, the Hawaiian-Chinese beauty Ching-ching, who was pregnant at the time, she had caught him fooling around with the brothel girls that flourished in the town of Kapaa. Without even a scene of recrimination, Ching-ching had simply ordered a carriage and driven back to the capital town of Lihue, where she boarded an H &amp; H steamer for Honolulu. She divorced Whip but kept both his daughter Iliki and his yet-unborn son John. Now there were two Mrs. Whipple Hoxworths in Honolulu and they caused some embarrassment to the more staid community. There was his first wife, Iliki Janders Hoxworth, who moved in only the best missionary circles, and there was Ching-ching Hoxworth, who lived within the Chinese community. The two never met, but Hoxworth &amp; Hale saw to it that each received a monthly allowance. The sums were generous, but not so much so as those sent periodically to Wild Whip’s second wife, the fiery Spanish girl Aloma Duarte Hoxworth, whose name frequently appeared in New York and London newspapers.</p>

  <p class="normal">During these early years of the twentieth century, Wild Whip lived alone at Hanakai, a driven, miserable man. Periodically he spent lost days in some back room of the Kapaa brothels, competing with his field hands for the favors of Oriental prostitutes. At other times he would pull himself together and organize the dreamlike sporting events that were a feature of Kauai. For example, he kept a large stable of quarter horses and a fine grassy oval on which to race them at meetings where Chinese and Hawaiian betters went wild and lost a year’s wages on one race. Part of Whip’s distrust of the Japanese stemmed from the fact that they did not bet madly on his horse races, for he said, “A man who can’t get excited about a horse race is really no man at all, and you can have the little yellow bastards.” But when it was pointed out that the Japanese enabled him to grow more cane than any other plantation in the islands, he always acknowledged that fact: “Work is their god and I respect them for it. But my love I reserve for men who like horses.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The highlight of any season came when Wild Whip organized one of his polo tournaments, for this was the conspicuous game of the islands, and he maintained a line of thirty-seven choice ponies. The games took place on a lovely grassy field edging the wild cliffs of Hanakai, but the high moment of any game occurred when a sudden shower would toss a rainbow above the players so that two riders fighting for the ball could pass mysteriously from shower into sunlight and back into the soft, misty rain. A polo game at Hanakai was one of the most beautiful sports a man could witness, and islanders often walked for miles to sit along the croton bushes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip played a fine game, and in order to maintain the quality of his team, always hired his lunas personally. Sitting carelessly in a deep chair, he watched the man approach down the long lanai and studied his gait. “Limber, supple, nice walk that one,” he would muse. His first question was invariable: “Young man, have you a good seat?” If the man stuttered or failed to understand what a good seat implied, Whip courteously excused him from further consideration. But if the man said, “I’ve been riding since I was three,” Whip proceeded with the interview. Traditionally, on Kauai, lunas were either German immigrants or Norwegians, and among themselves they circulated the warning: “Don’t apply at Hanakai unless you’re good at polo.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he hired a man Whip laid down three requirements: “Polished boots that come to the knee, and I want them polished till they gleam. White riding breeches, and I want them white. And finally, lunas at Hanakai never strike the workmen..”</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, few of the Germans and Norwegians were good at polo when they first started work, but Whip gave lessons every afternoon at four, and in time even the Japanese became proud when their boss and their lunas defended Hanakai’s championship against all comers from Kauai.</p>

  <p class="normal">But major excitement occurred periodically when a picked team from Honolulu, consisting mostly of Janderses and Whipples and Hewletts who had perfected their game at Yale—for many years in a row the stars of the Yale four came from Hawaii—chartered a boat to bring their ponies and their cheering section on an invasion of Kauai. Then haoles from all the local plantations moved out to Hanakai; enormous beds ten feet square were thrown along the lanai, with eight or ten haphazard people to the bed, and kitchens were set up behind the casuarina trees. In the evening gala dances were held with men in formal dress and women brilliant in gowns from Paris and Canton. Frequently, tournaments were staged with four or five competing teams, and all lived at Hanakai for a week. Then life was glorious, with champagne and flirtations, and often Wild Whip succeeded in sequestering one of the visitors’ wives in some darkened bedroom, so that over the polo games at Hanakai there hung always the ominous shadow of potential scandal.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was another shadow, too, for if the polo field and the croton bushes were made possible only by the protecting rim of silent casuarina trees which kept away the storms and the killing salt, so the life of the haoles was protected by the rim of silent Japanese laborers who lived in the womanless huts and who kept away the sweat, the toil and the work of building the future.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was curious that when the men of Hawaii returned to Yale for alumni celebrations, and when their former classmates who now lived in respectable centers like Boston and Philadelphia asked, “What holds a brilliant man like you in Hawaii?” the Janderses and the Hales and the Whipples usually replied longingly, “Have you ever seen a polo game at Hanakai? The ocean at your feet. The storms sweeping in with rainbows. When your pony slips, he leaves a bright red scar across the turf. You could live a hundred years in Philadelphia and never see anything like the polo season at Hanakai.” The Yale men who had gone to live in Philadelphia never understood, but their former classmates who had played polo along the Hawaii circuit never forgot that Hawaii in those years provided one of the best societies on earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the polo players had departed, when the field kitchens were taken down, and when the patient little Japanese gardeners were tending each cut in the polo turf as if it were a personal wound, Wild Whip would retire to his sprawling mansion overlooking the sea and get drunk. He was never offensive and never beat anyone while intoxicated. At such times he stayed away from the brothels in Kapaa and away from the broad lanai from which he could see the ocean. In a small, darkened room he drank, and as he did so he often recalled his grandfather’s words: “Girls are like stars, and you could reach up and pinch each one on the points. And then in the east the moon rises, enormous and perfect. And that’s something else, entirely different.” It was now apparent to Whip, in his forty-fifth year, that for him the moon did not intend to rise. Somehow he had missed encountering the woman whom he could love as his grandfather had loved the Hawaiian princess Noelani. He had known hundreds&#160; of women,&#160; but he&#160; had&#160;&#160; found&#160;&#160; none&#160; that&#160; a&#160; man&#160; could permanently want or respect. Those who were desirable were mean in. spirit and those who were loyal were sure to be tedious. It was probably best, he thought at such times, to do as he did: know a couple of the better girls at Kapaa, wait for some friend’s wife who was bored with her husband, or trust that a casual trip through the more settled camps might turn up some workman’s wife who wanted a little excitement.&#160; It wasn’t a bad life and was certainly less expensive in the long run than trying to marry and divorce a succession of giddy women; but often when he had reached this conclusion,&#160;&#160; through&#160;&#160; the&#160; bamboo&#160; shades&#160; of&#160; the&#160; darkened &#160;&#160;room&#160;&#160; in which he huddled a light would penetrate, and it would be the great moon risen from the waters to the east and now passing majestically high above the Pacific. It was an all-seeing beacon, brilliant enough to make the grassy lawns of Hanakai a sheet of silver, probing enough to find any mansion tucked away beneath the casuarina trees. When this moon sought out Wild Whip he would first draw in his feet, trying like a child to evade it, but when it persisted he often rose, threw open the lanai screens, and went forth to meet it. He would stand in the shimmering brilliance for a long time, listening to the surf pound in below, and in its appointed course the moon would disappear behind the jagged hills to the west.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was uncanny, at such moments, how the Hawaiian men who worked for Whip would sense his mood. In twos and threes, they would appear mysteriously with ukuleles, strumming them idly in subtle island harmonies, and Whip would hear them and would cry, “Eh, you! Pupule, you come!” And the men would unostentatiously gather about him, and he would grab a ukulele and begin to chant some long-forgotten song his grandmother had taught him. He became a Hawaiian, moody, distant, hungry for the message of the night; and for hours he would sing with his men, one song after another. A field hand would grunt, “Eh, boss? You got some okolehau?” And Whip would open some whiskey, and the bottle would pass reflectively from mouth to mouth, and the old laments of Hawaii would continue. At dawn the men would inconspicuously shuffle away, one or two at a time, but the man whose ukulele Wild Whip had borrowed would linger on until at last he would have to say, “Mo bettah I go now, boss,” and the long night would end.</p>

  <p class="normal">After such interludes Wild Whip always turned to his pineapples. On a well-protected plateau about the size of two tennis courts, perched at the head of the Hanakai valley and about two hundred yards from the African tulip tree, he had constructed a special field and fertilized it for the propagation of pineapples, for it was Whip’s belief that ultimately the growing of this fruit on high fields and sugar on low was the destiny of Hawaii. To anyone who would listen, he was eager to explain his theories.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look! The two things are natural partners. Sugar needs water, a ton of water for each pound of sugar. Pineapple doesn’t. Sugar thrives on low fields, pineapples on high. At the very point on a hillside where it’s no longer profitable to irrigate for sugar, that’s where pineapple grows best. And if you have sugar growing down here and pineapple up there, when the fruit gets ripe you drench it in sugar, can it, and sell both at a huge profit.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why in hell do you suppose I came to Kauai? Because it offers an ideal combination of sugar lands and pineapple lands. Before I leave, I’ll have the secret that’ll make Hanakai the richest plantation in the world.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whenever Whip looked at the land of Hawaii, with its fortunate combination of high dry fields and low wet ones, he became excited; but when he looked at his experimental pineapple beds, he became furious. For he had in his trial fields more than nineteen different kinds of pineapple, “and not one of them worth a goddamn.” He showed his visitors all that he had found so far: “That one with the savage hooks along its leaves—they’d cut you into pieces trying to harvest in a field full of them—they’re the Pernambuco and you can have every damned Pernambuco ever grown. The striped one is the Zebrina, looks good but the fruit’s foul. That interesting one in three colors is the Bracteatus, and for a time I had hopes for it, but the fruit’s too small. I have plants that look like rat tails, others that look like whips, some with teeth like sickles. The only two possibly worth bothering with are the Guatemala and the New Guinea, but they don’t prosper here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That means you have nothing really worth working on?” agriculturists asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yep. Wouldn’t try to grow any of ‘em commercially.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you conclude that pineapples aren’t suited to Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well … I wouldn’t admit that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You got something else in mind? Some new breed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe . . . maybe some day we’ll find exactly the right fruit for these islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At such times Hoxworth became hard and secretive, for if he was no longer obsessed by any one woman, and if he had reached a reluctant truce with the standard patterns of love, he did entertain a positive lust for something he had once seen. In 1896 a Rio de Janeiro hotel had served him a Cayenne pineapple, and the instant he had seen that barrel-shaped, sweet and heavy fruit he had known that this was the pineapple for Hawaii. He had expected that it would be simple to go to some agriculturist and say, “I’d like five thousand Cayenne plants,” and he had tried to do so; but he quickly found that the French who controlled that part of the Guiana coast where this fortunate mutation of the pineapple family had developed were as excited about its prospects as he. No Cayenne plants were allowed outside the colony. At the seaport of Cayenne, outgoing luggage was minutely inspected, so that when Whipple Hoxworth and wife Ching-ching, from Rio, arrived in French Guiana, the government knew before they landed that he was the big planter from Hawaii and that he was going to try to steal some Cayenne plants. Consequently, with Gallic perfidy they served Whip an endless succession of perfect Cayenne pineapples, heavy, succulent and aromatic. But no Cayenne plant did he see. When he casually suggested a visit to one of the plantations, it rained. When he tried to bribe a scurrilous type to bring him some roots, the man was a government spy placed outside the hotel for that special purpose. And when in frustration he decided to go home empty-handed, the customs officials searched every cubic inch of his luggage with the smiling assurance that “we suspect attempts are being made to smuggle guns to the prisoners on Devil’s Island.” Whip smiled back and said, “I agree, you must be very careful.” So he got no pineapple plants.</p>

  <p class="normal">He bought substitutes and cared for them tenderly, for he realized that the Cayenne itself must have sprung from some chance cross-fertilization of two types which of themselves were nothing. Therefore, the meanest rat-tailed, scrawny plant in Whip’s experimental field received the same care as the best Guatemala; but the fruit that resulted fell so far short of a Cayenne that Whip became increasingly morbid on the subject. From Australia he imported plants that were supposed to be Cayennes, but they did not produce the smooth-skinned fruits he had known, in South America. He could taste them now, and he imagined them being forced into cans cut to their size. He was haunted by this perfect pineapple, which he knew existed but which lay beyond his reach, and he became obsessed with the idea of acquiring a bundle of mother plants. For a time he considered a secret overland expedition from Paramaribo in Dutch Guiana, but discussions with geographers who knew the area convinced him that the intervening jungle was impenetrable. He tried suborning French colonial officials, but the government trusted its own subordinates no more than it trusted Whipple Hoxworth and checked them constantly, so that even though he poured some twenty thousand dollars’ worth of bribes into Guiana, he got no pineapple plants in return.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then one day a lanky Englishman named Schilling rode up to Hanakai on a wobbly horse, dismounted and asked for a whiskey soda. “I believe I am the man you are looking for,” Schilling said in clipped accents.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t need any more lunas,” Whip replied, “and besides, you aren’t husky enough.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have no intention of working for a living,” the lanky Englishman replied. “I have come to sell you something.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can think of nothing that I require,” Whip snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can think of something that you will want to pay a great deal of money for, Mr. Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two thousand prime Cayenne crowns.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As if his hand had frozen, Whip stopped pouring the whiskey. He made no pretense of not being interested, and his Adam’s apple moved up and down in his dry throat. He put the whiskey bottle down, turned, and looked steadily at his visitor. “Cayenne?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Prime crowns.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My father was a Dutchman before he became a British subject. He knows people in the Guianas.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are the crowns vital?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re already growing in a hothouse in England.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Wildly Hoxworth grabbed the tall man’s arm. “You’re sure they’re growing?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve brought a photograph,” Schilling replied, and he produced a snapshot of himself standing inside a greenhouse with pineapples growing about his feet, and from the hearts of several of the plants rose incontestably the distinctive Cayenne fruit.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Schilling . . .” Whip began nervously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dr. Schilling, botanist. <span>I’D</span> sell you the Cayennes, Mr. Hoxworth, but I want the job of raising them here in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A deal!” Wild Whip agreed. “I’ll send a special ship to pick them up. Can you keep them alive across the Atlantic and around the Horn?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m a botanist,” Dr. Schilling replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">While he waited for the Englishman’s, return, Wild Whip directed his feverish energy into laying out a special field to accommodate the two thousand crowns that Schilling had contracted to deliver, and as he worked he thought: “I’d like to find a man I could trust to care for these pineapples the way I’d do it.” And he remembered the stocky Japanese field hand who had been willing to fight him over the matter of galvanized iron for the hot bath. “That’s the kind of man I want,” he mused. “Someone with guts.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He saddled his horse and rode out to the sugar fields until he spotted Kamejiro. “Eh, you one fella!” he shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You speak me?” the rugged little Japanese asked with a friendly grin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How you like work boss-man one field?” And the compact was sealed. Now Kamejiro ran each morning from the camp to till the pineapple field, pulverizing the earth with his hands. And each night he ran back to tend his hot bath. Wild Whip, seeing him always in a hurry, thought: “That one does the work of three men,” and he raised his pay to seventy-five cents a day.</p>

  <p class="normal">Under Whip’s direction, Kamejiro plowed the land to a depth of two feet, and when its rich redness lay in the sunlight, Whip was pleased, for books had told him that above all else the pineapple required iron, and Kauai was practically solid iron. Every three months the field was turned again and special guano fertilizers were introduced to make it productive. Ditches were dug completely around the area to draw off unnecessary water, and a windbreak or wild plum and casuarina was planted to ward off any chance salt spray. Few brides have ever had homes arranged for them with the meticulous care that Wild Whip exercised in building this all-important seed bed. When it was done, he stood in the middle of its finely aerated soil and shouted to Kamejiro, “Bimeby all fields up there pineapple, eh?” And he pointed in all the upland directions as far as he could see, for he intended them all to be crowded with Cayenne plants, four thousand to the acre, and the money that he had so far made growing sugar would turn out to have been children’s coins for playing store.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first crop of Cayennes surpassed Whip’s hopes. Dr. Schilling proved himself both a botanist and a dipsomaniac, and from the front room of the Hanakai mansion, which he obviously intended never to leave, the tall Englishman directed the successful propagation of the plants that were to revolutionize the Hawaiian economy. Of the first two thousand Cayennes which had been abducted from the fields of French Guiana, nearly nineteen hundred grew to luscious maturity, and these first pineapples were an astonishment to the citizens of Hawaii. Whip, as was his custom, gave the fruit away and told everyone, “Start tilling your upland fields now. Gold is about to drip out of them in a fragrant flow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A pineapple plant produces slowly, only one fruit at the end of two years—technically it is a sorosis or bundle of fruits, each of the composite squares being the result of a separate flower—but when the fruit has matured, the plant offers four separate ways of propagating new plants: the crown of the pineapple fruit can be carefully torn off and planted; slips that have started growing from the base ” of the fruit can be lifted off and planted; suckers that have begun to spring out from the base of the plant can be used in the same way; or the stump itself can be cut up into chunks and planted like potatoes. From each surviving plant Dr. Schilling was thus able to recover one crown, three or four slips, two or three suckers, and two or three stump sections. By 1910 the pineapple industry was established in Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in 1911 it was overtaken by disaster, for the fields which Wild Whip had so carefully prepared stopped nourishing the plants, and they began to turn a sickly yellow. In panic Whip commanded Dr. Schilling to sober up and find out what was happening, but the drunken Englishman could not focus on the problem, so Whip stormed through the mansion which he now shared with Schilling and smashed all bottles containing alcohol. Then Dr. Schilling pulled himself together and spent some time in the fields. “I must make some experiments,” he reported, and a corner of the mansion was given over to test tubes and beakers, but all Schilling was doing was using fresh pineapples for the distillation of a super-fine grade of alcohol which he liked better than whiskey, and he was soon incommunicado.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip solved this impasse by beating the Englishman into insensibility, then throwing him into a cold bath. Apparently others had treated Schilling in this manner, for he took no great offense, shivering in the ‘tub and whimpering like a child. “By God,” Hoxworth shouted, “you brought these plants here and you’ll find out what’s wrong with them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He dressed the gawky scientist, put his shoes on, and personally led the shaky man into the fields. “What’s wrong with those plants?” he stormed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, Brother Hoxworth! You can’t stand there and command me to find out what’s happened. The human mind doesn’t work that way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yours will!” Hoxworth roared.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Suppose I start to walk down that path and down that road and never look at these plants again. Then what?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then by the time you get to the road, Dr. Schilling, you can’t walk. Because both your legs are broken.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I believe you would,” the shaken Englishman said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You bet I would,” Whip growled. “Now get to work.” He stood back, stared in shock, and yelled, “Now what in hell are you doing?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m tasting the soil,” Dr. Schilling replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, for Christ’s sake,” Whip snorted and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took Dr. Schilling four weeks to make up his mind about the pineapple plants, and when he reported to his employer it was obvious that he himself scarcely believed his own conclusions. “This is extraordinary, Brother Hoxworth, and you won’t believe it, but those plants are starved for iron.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ridiculous!” Hoxworth stormed. He was sick and tired of this infuriating Englishman and was at last ready to throw him off the plantation.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Dr. Schilling replied soberly. “I’m convinced that they are about to die for lack of iron.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s preposterous!” Hoxworth stormed. “This goddamned island is practically solid iron. Look at the soil, man!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s iron, that’s true,” Schilling agreed. “But I’m afraid it must be iron in some form that the plants cannot use.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can they stand in solid iron and not be able to use it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That,” Schilling said, “is why the universe will always be a mystery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you fooling with me?” Hoxworth asked ominously. “Who would dare?” Schilling replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you want us to do?”&#160; Hoxworth asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to sprinkle iron, in a different kind of solution, over these plants.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! It’s totally preposterous. You get back out there and find out what’s really wrong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s iron,” Schilling said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can you be sure?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can taste it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you run any tests on it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. I don’t have to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, run some tests. No! Don’t! You’d just distill yourself some more alcohol. What kind of iron do you want?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Iron sulfate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As a result of this decision, in late 1911 Kamejiro Sakagawa marched through the experimental fields of the Hanakai Pineapple Plantation lugging a bucket of spray, which he directed onto the yellow leaves of the perishing plants, and as he passed, the solution of sulfate of iron ran down the narrow leaves and penetrated to the red soil about the roots. As if by magic the sickly plants began to revive, and within four days the yellow leaves were returning to their natural color. The Cayennes were saved, and when it was proved, as Dr. Schilling suspected, that they had been standing in iron yet starving for iron, Wild Whip joyously gathered up an armful of ripe fruit and tossed it onto the mansion floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brew yourself some alcohol and stay drunk as long as you like,” he commanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sometimes Kamejiro, running to work and running back to tend his hot bath, would not see the tall Englishman for weeks at a time, and then as he cut the lawn he would find Schilling in a basket chair by the side of the cliff, staring down at the play of surf as it struck the opposite rocks.</p>

  <p class="normal">Schilling was a surprising man, a drunken, besotted individual who could think. One day when, he was driving into Kapaa with Whip in one of the first cars on Kauai, he spotted a junk yard and said, “You ought to buy that, Brother Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That junk? Why?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re paying a lot of money for iron sulfate, and that’s what it is. Rusty junk to which sulphuric acid has been applied.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Whip bought the junk yard and launched an iron sulfate factory, and in later years, when automobiles had become numerous, he bought all the old wrecks on Kauai for four dollars each, piled them up, drenched them with gasoline and burned away the rubber and the horse hair. When what was left had rusted he treated the junk with sulphuric acid and remarked, “Everyone who eats pineapple is eating the handiwork of Henry Ford, God bless him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But in the growing of pineapple, which brought hundreds of millions of dollars into the territory, when one problem was licked, the next arose, for apparently the Cayenne did not enjoy growing in Hawaii and fell prey to one disaster after another. When the iron problem was solved, the mealy-bug arose, and once more the industry seemed doomed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The ugly, louselike little bugs were moved from place to place by ants, who tended them like milch cows, living off their sweet, nutritious exudations. Particularly, the mealy-bugs loved pineapple, whose growth they destroyed, and it seemed an act of conscious malevolence when millions of ants hiked several miles to deposit their cows upon the precious pineapples. Dr. Schilling studied the problem for several months, while field after field of Wild Whip’s choicest Cayennes wilted and died from the infestation. Then he hit upon a dual solution which halted the mealy-bugs: around each field he planted decoy rows of pineapple, and these intercepted the mealy-bugs and kept them from invading the productive areas; and around the entire field he laid long boards soaked repeatedly in creosote, and these fended off the ants and their ugly cows. After this victory over the little lice he subsided into a year-long lethargy of drunkenness, awaiting the next disaster.</p>

  <p class="normal">It came when Whip’s canning manager reported: “Because the Cayennes are so big we can’t fit them into the cans, and waste forty per cent of the fruit trimming them down to can size.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What in hell do you want me to do?” Whip snarled, wearied by the constant battle to keep his fields productive.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What we’ve got to have is smaller Cayennes,” the manager explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">So Wild Whip stormed back to Hanakai, shook his English expert into reasonable sobriety, and said, “Dr. Schilling, you’ve got to make the pineapples smaller.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Through a golden haze that had been accumulating for thirteen months the scraggly Englishman said, “The mind of man can accomplish anything. Draw me the pineapple you want.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip went back to the canning manager, and together they drew on paper the specifications of the perfect pineapple. It had to be sufficiently barrel-shaped to leave a good rim of fruit when the core was cut out. It had to be juicy, acid, sweet, small, without barbs on the leaves, solid and golden in color. With a ruler and French curves the two men constructed the desired fruit, and when Whip thrust the paper at Schilling he said, “That’s what we want.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Schilling, glad to have an alternative to drunkenness, replied, “That’s what you’ll get.” He inspected every pineapple field on Kauai, comparing the available fruit against the ideal image, and whenever he found something close to the printed specifications, he marked that plant with a flag, and after four years of this infinitely patient work he announced, “We have built the perfect pineapple.” When he delivered the first truckload to the cannery, the manager was ecstatic. “Our problems are over,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Until the next one,” Schilling replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1911 a woman writer from New York, who had once stayed in Honolulu four weeks, wrote a rather scurrilous book about Hawaii in which she lamented three things: the influence of the missionaries who had maliciously killed off the Hawaiians by dressing them in Mother Hubbards; the criminality of companies like Janders &amp; Whipple who had imported Orientals; and the avarice of missionary descendants like those in Hoxworth &amp; Hale who had stolen the lush lands of Hawaii. After her book had created something of a sensation throughout America she returned to the islands and in triumph came to Kauai, where at a splendid polo tournament she was presented to Wild Whip Hoxworth. His team had just defeated Honolulu, and he was flushed with victory and should have been in a gracious mood, but as he was introduced to the lady author he thought he understood who she was and asked coldly, “Are you the good lady who wrote Hawaii’s Shame?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” she replied proudly, “I am,” for she was accustomed to being fawned over. “What do you think of it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am,” Whip said, carefully placing his polo mallet on a rack lest he be tempted to use it in an unorthodox manner, “I thought your book was complete bullshit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The polo players and their ladies recoiled from Whip’s savage comment, and some began to offer the startled lady their apologies, but Whip interrupted. “No, there will be no apologies. Stand where you are, ma’am, and look in every direction. Whatever you see was brought into these islands by men like me. The sugar upon which our economy rests? My Grandfather Whipple, a missionary, brought that in. The pineapples? I’m the grandson of missionaries and I brought them in. The pine trees, the royal palms, the tulip trees, the avocados, the wild plum, the crotons, the house and the horses. We brought them all dn. The Hoxworth mango, best fruit in the world, is named after me. And as for the Orientals. Heh, Kamejiro, you come, eh? This bandy-legged little man has done more work in Hawaii . . . he’s built more and he will continue to build more than a dozen of the people you were wailing about. I brought him in here and I’m proud of it. I’m only sorry he doesn’t intend to stay. Now, ma’am, if you have any more questions about Hawaii, I’d be glad to answer ‘em. Because I hope you’ll go home and write another book, and this time not be such a horse’s ass.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He bowed and left her gagging. In Honolulu, of course, his polo-field speech, as it was termed, was a momentary sensation, since, as one of the Hale women explained, “If one were picking a man to defend the missionaries, he would hardly pick Wild Whip.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He and his drunken English friend lived on at Hanakai, with fairly frequent visits to the brothels at Kapaa. At the cliffside mansion he entertained a good deal, and in his leisurely talks over brandy he began to expound the first coherent theory of Hawaii: “What I visualize is an island community that treasures above all else its agricultural lands. On them it grows bulk crops of sugar and pineapples and ships them to the mainland in H &amp; H ships. With the money we get we buy the manufactured goods our people need, things like iceboxes, automobiles, finished lumber, hardware and food. Thus the ships go one way loaded and come back loaded. That’s the destiny of Hawaii, and anyone who disturbs that fine-balance is an enemy of the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was willing to identify the enemies of Hawaii: “Anyone who tampers with our shipping ought to be shot. Anyone who tries to talk radical ideas to our field hands ought to be run off the islands. Anyone who interferes with our assured supply of cheap labor from Asia strikes a blow at sugar and pineapple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Once he confided: “H &amp; H have run the ships cheaply and faithfully. I see no reason why any radical changes are required. And I think you must admit that J &amp; W have run the plantations well. Nobody can lodge a complaint against them. As long as these two firms continue to serve the islands justly, it seems to me the welfare of Hawaii is assured, and for outsiders like that goddamned woman author to go around raising a lot of questions is downright ingratitude.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In 1912 the campaign for President on the mainland grew rather warm, and for the first time in some years Democrats felt that they had a good chance of sending their man, Woodrow Wilson, to the White House. Of course, citizens of Hawaii could not vote for the national offices, but in the island elections a few pathetic Democrats began to parrot the optimism existing on the mainland, and one misguided liberal even went so far as to appear before a mass meeting of six in the nearby town of Kapaa. Out of sheer curiosity over a human being who dared to be a Democrat in Hawaii, Wild Whip insinuated himself as the seventh listener and stood appalled as the man actually sought votes for his party: “There is a new spirit abroad in America, a clean, sharp wind from the prairies, an insistent voice from the great cities. Therefore I propose to do something that has never before been done in these islands. I, a Democrat and proud of the fact, am going to visit each of the sugar and pineapple plantations to explain in my words what the ideas of Woodrow Wilson and his adherents mean. Tell your friends that I’ll be there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In some agitation Wild Whip rode home and carefully took down all the firearms he kept at Hanakai. Inspecting each, he summoned his lunas and said, “I just heard a Democrat say he was coming here to address our workmen. If he steps six inches onto Hanakai, shoot him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the lunas who had been through high school asked deferentially, “But doesn’t he have the right to speak?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Right?” Whip thundered. “A Democrat have the right to step onto my plantation and spread his poison? My God! I say who shall come here and who shall not. This is my land and I’ll have no alien ideas parading across it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Lunas in 1912 were not apt to be easily frightened, and this one stuck to his guns. “But if this man is a spokesman for one of the political parties . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Von Schlemm!” Whip roared in profound amazement. “I’m astonished at such talk from you. Can’t you remember what that filthy Democrat, Grover Cleveland, did to Hawaii? Are you old enough to recall how those corrupted Democratic senators voted against us time and time again? What surprises me is that somebody hasn’t already shot this dirty little bastard. No Democrat has a place in Hawaii, and if one tries to walk onto my plantation hell crawl home with broken legs.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The aspiring politician did try to invade Hanakai, and Wild Whip, backed up by four heavily armed lunas, met him at the edge of the red-dust road. “You can’t come in here, mister,” Whip warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m a citizen in pursuit of my political rights.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re a Democrat, and there’s no place for you in these islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Hoxworth, I’m coming to your plantation to speak to your men about the issues in the election.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My men don’t want to hear the nonsense you talk.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Hoxworth, there’s a new wind blowing across America. Woodrow Wilson is going to be elected President. And he promises a fair deal for all men. Even your workmen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I tell my workmen how to vote,” Whip explained. “And they vote for the welfare of these islands. Now you go back to Honolulu and don’t give me any more trouble.” The four lunas moved in upon the visitor.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How is it going to sound,” the politician asked, “if I report to the press that I was forcibly thrown off Hanakai Plantation?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip, still lean and hard at fifty-five, reached forward, grabbed the offensive radical by the shoulders, and shook him as if he were a child. “No paper would publish such rubbish. Christ, if a rattlesnake tried to crawl onto my plantation and I shot it, I’d be a hero. I feel obligated to treat a Democrat the same way. Get out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The visitor calmly smoothed his shirt, straightened his sleeves, and announced: “In pursuit of man’s inalienable rights, I\am going to come into your plantation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you try it,” Whip said, “you’ll be thrown out on your inalienable ass.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The politician walked boldly onto the red soil of Hanakai and started for the lane of royal palms and Norfolk pines. He had gone only a few steps when the four lunas grabbed him, lifted him in the air, and threw him roughly back onto the road, where he fell heavily upon the inalienable portion of his anatomy, as Whip had predicted. While the surprised visitor sat in the red dust Whip advised him: “Go back to Honolulu. No Democrat will ever be allowed on this plantation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when the man had gone, Whip began to appreciate the real danger involved, so he summoned his lunas. “You are to tell every man on this plantation entitled to a vote that he is not to bother voting for this man or that. He’s to vote the straight Republican ticket. One cross mark is all he needs.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can warn them,” one luna pointed out, “but can we enforce it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s a way,” Whip replied cryptically, and when the local elections came that year he stationed himself six feet from the Hanakai voting booth and as each of his qualified laborers approached he looked the man in the eye and said, “You know how to vote, don’t you, Jackson?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir, Mr. Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“See that you do it,” Whip replied ominously, but he left nothing to chance. When Jackson was in the booth, with the protecting canvas about him so that no one could spy upon his ballot or the way he marked it, he reached for the voting pencil. It was tied to the end of a piece of string which led aloft, passing through an eyelet screwed into the ceiling of the booth, so that if he was about to mark his ballot Democratic, the string was ready to form a clear angle to the far right and thus betray his perfidy. But to make doubly sure, Whip had previously ordered that all pencils used for voting be of maximum hardness, and that the paper on the shelf of the voting booth be soft, so that when Jackson voted he was forced to punch his pencil strongly onto the ballot, leaving on the back side an easily read indication of how he had voted. Jackson folded his ballot and handed it to the Portuguese clerk, but that official paused before placing it in the ballot box, and in that moment Wild Whip was free to inspect the back.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right, Jackson,” Whip muttered as the man left.</p>

  <p class="normal">As soon as the voting was over, Whip assembled his lunas and reported: “Jackson, Allingham and Gates voted Democratic. Get them out of here before midnight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What shall we tell them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing. They know the evil they’ve done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And he stood in the shadows of the royal palms as the three traitors were thrown onto the public road, their bundles of goods under their arms.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was as a result of this election, and the dangers represented by it—Wilson ruling in Washington, men like Jackson beginning to vote Democratic on Kauai—that Wild Whip made his decision. “I’m going back to Honolulu,” he told Dr. Schilling. “You’re welcome to live here and take care of the pineapples.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are you intending to do?” Schilling asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s a spirit of rebellion in the world. Crazy liberal thinking. Probably infected my own company. I’m going back to take over control of H &amp; H.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought they threw you out? Exiled you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They did,” Wild Whip confessed. “But in those days I didn’t own the company.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you now?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, but the Yale men running it don’t know it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You going to chop off a lot of heads?” Schilling asked with the fiendish joy of childhood.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not if they’re good men,” Whip replied, disappointing his permanent guest. And by Christmas Eve, 1912, he was in sole, dictatorial control of the great H &amp; H empire, and although heads did not roll in the Schilling sense of the word, every man who was suspected of having voted Democratic was fired. “In Hawaii and in H &amp; H,” Whip explained without rancor, “there is simply no place for such men.”</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>ANY GENERAL CONCLAVE</span> of the great Kee hui was apt to be impressive. The older sons, like Asia, who ran the restaurant, retained their Chinese names—Kee Ah Chow—and wore pigtails and black sateen suits; but the younger sons cut their pigtails and wore contemporary American dress. They also preferred the English translations of their names, such as Australia Kee instead of Kee Oh Chow.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the hui converged upon the ugly house up Nuuanu, they formed colorful processions. Some brought their wives and by 1908 were able to bring grown grandsons along with their pretty Chinese and Hawaiian wives. On festive occasions great-grandchildren appeared in number, tumbling about the grounds on which the family still grew taro and pineapples. The Kees, counting their wives and husbands, now numbered ninety-seven, but of course they were never able to convene at one time, because a dozen or so were apt to be at school on the mainland. Neither Yale nor Harvard had yet known a Kee, but Michigan, Chicago, Columbia and Pennsylvania did, and it was possible for a Chinese in Hawaii to be born, financed, protected at law, married, tended medically and buried---all at the hands of Kees. In addition, he could rent his land from them, and buy his vegetables, his meat and his clothes.</p>

  <p class="normal">The most conspicuous member was still Nyuk Tsin. In 1908 she was sixty-one years old, and although she no longer lugged pineapples through the streets in her famous twin baskets, she still grew them and supervised others in the peddling. Year by year she grew shorter, thinner, balder, and although her face showed the wrinkling of age, her mind retained the resilience of youth. Her life consisted of purposeful ritual. Each year, with solemn dignity, she accompanied her brilliant son Africa to the tax office to pay her taxes. Twice a year she took eight or ten members of her family to the Punti store where they sent money to her husband’s real wife in China. She had died in 1881, but the family in the Low Village continued to write letters of grateful acknowledgment on her behalf. Every two or three years Nyuk Tsin assembled as many of her family as possible for the trip to the leper colony at Kalawao, where they reported to their ancestor. And each fall, as if she were sending sacrifices to the gods, she took six or eight of her ablest grandsons down to the Hoxworth &amp; Hale docks and bought them tickets for the mainland. The old woman conserved human resources just as carefully as she had the irrigated land of her first taro patch.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, it was she who now called the great hui into formal meeting, for two matters of prime importance, and far beyond the capacity of lawyer Africa to solve, had been brought to her attention; and while her great-grandchildren played in the dusty yard she talked to the thirty-odd elders who met with her.</p>

  <p class="normal">The children of Africa Kee needed guidance, and Nyuk Tsin said, “Africa’s oldest daughter, Sheong Mun, whom you prefer to call Ellen, is in deep perplexity, and I am not wise enough to counsel her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What has she done?” Asia’s wife asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She has fallen in love with a haole,” Nyuk Tsin replied. A hush fell over the assembly, for although the Kees, under Nyuk Tsin’s approval if not her outright urgings, had always felt free to marry Hawaiians, none had yet made any signs of wanting to marry white Americans, and Ellen’s bold proposal represented a jolt in family procedures. The clan turned to look at Africa’s daughter, a bright-eyed, quick, handsome girl of twenty, and she looked back.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is the white man?” Asia asked, exercising his prerogative as oldest son.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell him, Sheong Mun,” the old woman said.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a soft voice taught her by the women teachers at the Episcopalian school, Ellen said, “He is a junior officer on one of the navy ships at Pearl Harbor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A chorus of gasps came from the hui. A white man and a military man, too! This was indeed, as Wu Chow’s Auntie had warned, a major problem, and Europe, who had married a Hawaiian girl, said, “It’s bad enough to want to marry a white man, because they don’t make good husbands and they take money out of the family. But to marry a military man is really indecent. No self-respecting girl . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Australia interrupted: “We’re not in China. I know some fine navy men.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Europe replied stiffly: “I don’t.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Asia observed: “I had hoped never to see one of my family want to many a soldier.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Australia snapped: “He’s a sailor, and there’s a big difference.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Europe said: “Military men are military men, and they make miserable husbands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Australia cried: “Why don’t you take those ideas back to China? That’s where they came from.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this, Nyuk Tsin intervened and said in her low, imperative voice, “It would be much better if Sheong Mun had fallen in love with a Chinese boy, or if she had come to me as a dutiful girl and said, ‘Wu Chow’s Auntie, find me a husband.’ But she has done neither of these things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The worse for her,” Asia said sadly. “In my restaurant I see many girls who stray from the old patterns, and they all suffer for it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ridiculous!” Australia’s wife snapped. “Asia! You know very well that when I was a girl I used to hide in your restaurant and kiss Australia behind the dried ducks. And nothing bad came of it except that I married your lazy brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That was the beginning of what I’m talking about,” Asia warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ridiculous!” Australia’s wife, a high-spirited Ching beauty, laughed. “Because do you know who used to whistle at me to let me know your brother was waiting?” The Kees looked at the bright-eyed young wife, and with a dramatic gesture she pointed directly at Nyuk Tsin, sitting gray-haired and solemn at the head of the family. “That one did it! She’s worse than any of us!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The family roared at the old woman’s embarrassment, and finally Nyuk Tsin wiped her blushing face and said softly, “I must admit I arranged it. But remember that Ching Siu Han was a Chinese girl. And a Hakka. And could be trusted. Today we are talking about something much different. A white man. And a soldier.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Auntie!” Ellen interrupted. “He’s not a soldier. You must forget your old prejudices.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Asia asked, “Will he bring any land into our hui? Any money?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Ellen said resolutely. “In fact, he’ll take money out. Because I have got to have two hundred dollars for clothes and more later for other things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Together the Kees sucked in their breath and faced the day they had long feared. Sooner or later, some member of the family would want to marry a white man. Now it had come and those who dreaded the event suspected that Africa with the radical new ideas he had acquired at Michigan must somehow be at fault. Therefore, the older members of the family began staring at the lawyer, and he suffered from their harsh gaze. Finally Europe asked brusquely, “Tell us, Africa. What do you think of this?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long hush in the hot room, and voices of children could be heard. Finally Africa spoke. “I am humiliated,” he said. “I am ashamed that it is my daughter who wants to marry outside our circle of acquaintance. I have given her a good education and her mother has ‘tried to teach her to be a decent Hakka. I am humiliated and I do not know what to do.” Suddenly the pressure upon him became great and he hid his face in his hands, sobbing quietly. The disgrace he had brought upon the family immobilized his speech, so his wife added, “He feels that he must accept the shame for what his daughter has done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this solemn moment Australia interjected a happier note. “Of course it’s his responsibility. If a man goes to Michigan, he picks up foreign ways. I suppose that’s why we sent him to Michigan. Remember, Asia, it was your sons who went to Pennsylvania. It was your sons who brought American friends into our homes, and it was one of those friends who met Sheong Mun. Bang! They’re in love! Ellen, if your stingy father won’t give you the two hundred dollars I will.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It isn’t the money that I want so much, Uncle Australia, as your blessing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have mine!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And mine!” Australia’s wife chimed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have I yours, Wu Chow’s Auntie?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The family turned to look at Nyuk Tsin, sitting with her worn hands in her lap. “I am concerned with only one problem, Sheong Mun,” the old woman said. “When your children are born they will be the children of a white man, and they will be lost to our family. Promise me that you will send me a letter each time you have a child, and I will go to the Punti scholar and find his true name, and we will write it in our book and send the name back to China, as we have always done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My sons will not want Chinese names,” hard-headed Ellen countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Later they will,” the old woman said. “They will want to know who they are, and in the book the information will be waiting for them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As the Kees dispersed over the face of the world, marrying with men who worked in strange lands, letters arrived constantly for Nyuk Tsin. Her sons would read them to her, and she would note the births of all children. For each son she got a proper name, and registered it in China, and as she predicted this day in 1908, the time did come when the boy so named would want to know what the Chinese half of his ancestry signified, and men would arrive in Honolulu whom you would not recognize as Chinese, and they would meet old Nyuk Tsin, and she would take down a book she could not read, and the interpreter would pick out the information and the Chinese-German-Irish-English boy would understand a little better who he was.</p>

  <p class="normal">But on this particular day the old woman was concerned with Africa’s children, and after it had been grudgingly agreed that the lawyer’s daughter, Kee Sheong Mun, known locally as Ellen Kee, could marry her sailor, Nyuk Tsin coughed and said, “It is time we think again about getting Hong Kong into Punahou.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Asia groaned, America rose and left the room in disgust, and the rest of the family turned to stare at Africa’s youngest son, a square-headed wrinkle-eyed boy of fifteen. Among the family it was believed that young Koon Kong, who was known as Hong Kong, had inherited his father’s intellectual brilliance. He was most able at figures, knew Punti, Hakka, English and Hawaiian well, and seemed unusually gifted at managing money, for he augmented whatever he got hold of by lending it out to his numerous cousins. His rate of interest was a standard, inflexible ten per cent a week which he enforced by meticulous collections on Friday after school. As his name Koon indicated, he was of the fourth generation—Koon Kong, Earth’s Atmosphere—and he was of the earth. In his generation of Kees there were twenty-seven boys carrying the name Koon, one brother and twenty-six cousins, and he was the cleverest of them all. If any Kee was ever going to elbow his way into Punahou, Hone Kong was the one, and as the problem opened for discussion, the family grew tense.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will Hong Kong’s mother tell us how her son is doing in school?” the matriarch began.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Africa Kee, the older of the striking Ching girls, said, “His marks have been excellent. His behavior has been spirited but has brought no reprimand. I am proud of my son’s accomplishment and feel that he merits the interest the family is taking in him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does Hong Kong think he can do the work at Punahou … if he is accepted?” Nyuk Tsin asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">The boy was embarrassed by the attention focused on him, but he yearned to get into Punahou, so he bore the indignity. Hunching up one shoulder he said, “If the Lum boy can do the work, I can do the work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the mention of the Lum boy, the Kees grew bitter. For a dozen years they had been trying to get one of their sons into Punahou, Hawaii’s source of excellence, but for one reason or another they had never succeeded, even though they were a fairly wealthy family and could boast of Africa as a leading professional man. Yet the Lums, who really did not amount to much except that their father was a dentist and a man who loved to speak in public, had maneuvered one of their boys into the cherished haven.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin said, “I think that this time we really have a good chance. I have asked a dear old friend to counsel with us as to what we must do to get Hong Kong accepted.” She gave a signal and a grandson ran out to bring back a tall, bald Englishman with outrageous white mustaches and a flamboyant energy that projected him into the hot room, where he kissed Nyuk Tsin and cried in flowery Chinese: “Ah ha! We plot against the white people! Strike the tocsin! China shall rise!”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Uliassutai Karakoram Blake, the mad schoolteacher and the trusted friend of all Chinese. He was older and stouter but no more subdued, and now he locked his hands behind his neck, rocking to and fro as if he were going to fall over. “Beloved and prolific Kees,” he said, “let us face the truth. There are good schools and there are great schools, and every family is entitled to send his ablest sons to the greatest. Iolani, where I slave for a pittance, is a good school. Punahou is a great school. It lends authority and glamour and caste. England is built on such foundations and so is Hawaii. Let a man use a wrong knife, and he is condemned to the Liberal Party for life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s he talking about?” one of Australia’s boys whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m talking about you!” Uliassutai Karakoram Blake shouted in English, flailing his arms out and thrusting his head a few inches from the face of the startled young Chinese. “Stand up!” Awkwardly the boy rose and Blake pointed at him as if he were an exhibit.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Behold the scion of the Kee hui,” he said in erudite Chinese. “He has done well at Iolani School, but he has not yet been accepted at Punahou. He is therefore limited to a perpetual secondary acceptance in Honolulu. He cannot associate with the men who rule the city. He cannot learn to speak with their inflections. He lacks their peculiar polish. And he must remain the rest of his life a Chinese peasant. Sit down!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Blake turned his back on the boy and said to the elders, “The compassionate Buddha knows that at Iolani I have given you Chinese the salt of my blood and the convolutions of my brain, and I have raised you from ignorance into light, and the compassionate Buddha also knows that I wish I had done half as well with my light as you wonderful people have done with yours. If I had, I wouldn’t now be toiling out the evening years of my life as an underpaid schoolmaster. Africa, how much did you earn last year?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Chinese loved this ridiculous man and his circumlocutions. With his British regard for proprieties and his Oriental love of bombast, he seemed Chinese, and now he got to the meat of his visit: “You might think that I, as an Iolani teacher who had brought Hong Kong to this point of his education, would object to the proposal that you now transfer him to Punahou. Not at all. A family like yours is entitled to have a son at the best school Hawaii can provide. There he will rub elbows with future lawyers, business giants, community leaders. If I were a Kee, I would suffer any humiliation to get my son into Punahou. Hong Kong, stand up. I tell you, Kees, there is as fine a boy as Hawaii has ever produced. He merits the best. Hong Kong, depart.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the embarrassed boy had gone, Uliassutai Karakoram said, “Wu Chow’s Auntie, it will be very difficult indeed for you to get that boy into Punahou. He’s too intelligent, and your family is too able. The white people want to have one or two Chinese in their school, but not the best. They prefer slow, stolid boys of no great imagination. The Lum boy is ideal. Hong Kong is not, because even Buddha himself would refuse to prophesy what Hong Kong may one day accomplish. Africa, are you aware that you have sired a revolutionary genius?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hong Kong has far more power than I ever had, Mr. Blake,” Africa confessed to his old teacher.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wu Chow’s Auntie!” Uliassutai Karakoram pleaded suddenly. “Would you not consider trying to get some other grandson into Punahou?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Nyuk Tsin replied evenly. “He is a brilliant boy. He deserves the best.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The big Englishman shrugged his shoulders and said, “If you’re determined to go against my advice, let’s see what evil tricks you ought to attempt this time. Who visited Punahou last time?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Africa Kee, a handsome, modern Chinese wife, raised her hand. “Stand up!” Blake snapped. He studied her carefully, dressed as she was in western style, and said, “Couldn’t we send someone a little less . . . modern? White people feel safer when an Oriental looks more like a coolie.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There were some things the Kees would not tolerate, which was what made them a significant family, and now Africa said simply, “If my son applies to Punahou, his mother goes with him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“May Buddha bless all stubborn people,” Blake said magniloquently, “for without them this would be a most miserable world. But could not your wife dress a little more inconspicuously? She must look prosperous enough to pay the tuition, yet not so self-assured that she would ever say anything in a meeting of the children’s parents. We want her to look unalterably Chinese, yet aspiring to become a decent American. We want her to look proud enough to clean her fingernails, yet humble enough to remain slightly stooped over as if she lugged baskets of pineapples about the town.” He bowed grandly to Nyuk Tsin and said, “Do you think your son’s wife can acquire the proper look of a Chinese appealing to white people for help?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Nyuk Tsin said coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought not,” Blake said sadly. “Then you are prepared for Hong Kong to be rejected again?”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point America, whose two sons had tried in vain to enter Punahou, returned to the meeting and growled, “We are prepared to be rejected forever, Mr. Blake.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am sorry that you were not all born a little more stupid,” the flamboyant Englishman said, “because then, with your money, you’d be accepted gracefully. But of course, if you had been more stupid . . . that one in particular,” and he pointed at Nyuk Tsin, “why you wouldn’t have the money you now have, and you would be kept out of Punahou on grounds of poverty.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think Hong Kong has a chance this time?” Nyuk Tsin pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Blake said. “If I were a white man in Honolulu, I would never allow one of you damned Kees anywhere. You’re smart. You work. You gang together. You’re ambitious. First thing you know you’ll be teaching your daughters to lure white men into marriage.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sheong Mun is going to many a naval officer,” Nyuk Tsin said softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the hot room Uliassutai Karakoram Blake stopped ranting. He looked at the fresh, handsome child he had once taught. Little Ellen Kee, who could sing so charmingly. Gravely he went up to her, kissed her on the cheeks and said, quietly, “May the compassionate Buddha have mercy upon us all. The years of our lives are so short and the currents of the world are so strong. Good-bye, dear Kees. You will not get into Punahou … not this time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was gone the elders of the family considered the many ideas he had proposed, and Nyuk Tsin said, “That strange man is right. Hong Kong’s mother does look too modem, as if she were forcing her way upon the haoles. It will be too easy to reject her. This time we really must send someone else. How about Europe’s wife? She’s Hawaiian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Africa cried. “He is my son, and he will report to Punahou with his own mother, and if they reject us again, let it be so.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This time, then, I will go along,” Nyuk Tsin announced. “I will be barefooted and I will represent the old ways.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Africa protested again. “My wife, who will dress as she pleases, will take my son to Punahou and seek admission. I will tolerate no subterfuges.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Africa,” the old matriarch said softly, “the school has shown that it will accept one or two Chinese. Now it is terribly important that one of our boys be chosen. Please, this time allow me to arrange things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have business on the Big Island,” Africa said solemnly. “I shall go there and bear no part of this humiliation.” He left the room and the clan breathed more easily, for he was a stubborn man.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now, when the Lums got their son into Punahou,” Nyuk Tsin counseled, “the boy’s mother wore a very plain dress, and her hair straight back, and she kept her eyes on the floor. I am therefore going to say flatly that Hong Kong’s mother cannot go this time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will go with my husband to the Big Island,” Africa’s wife announced, and she too left the plotters.</p>

  <p class="normal">After much discussion, and after carefully studying the devices by which earlier Chinese families had managed to get sons into Punahou, the Kees hit upon an involved strategy. Barefoot Nyuk Tsin would go in smock and pants to give the proper coolie touch. Europe’s wife would go as a pure-blooded Hawaiian to show that the Kees respected local traditions. And Australia’s wife, the pretty Ching girl, would go in a very modest western-style dress to prove that the family knew how to eat with a knife and fork. The boy Hong Kong, who had an intellectual ability four levels higher than anyone then studying at Punahou, would tag along in a carefully selected suit that bespoke both the ability to pay tuition and a quiet gentility not common among newly rich Chinese families.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a hot day when the four Kees drove up to Punahou in a rented carriage, it having been decided that this was slightly more propitious than walking, and in the interview the three women played their roles to perfection, but Hong Kong squinted slightly and thought just a little too long before answering questions, brilliant though his replies were, and in due time the family got the news: “We regret that this year, due to overcrowded conditions, we can find no place for your son, whose marks and general deportment seemed otherwise acceptable.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The letter was delivered to Africa in his law offices, and he sat for a long time pondering it. At first he was consumed with rage at the humiliation his family had willingly undergone, and then he spent about an hour shoving the formal letter about his desk into this position and that. Finally he summoned his son and waited until the boy came in breathless from play along the river. In even, un-impassioned tones he said, “Hong Kong, you will not go back to school any more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought you said I was to go to Michigan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. What you require to learn, son, you can learn right here. Tonight you will start reading this book on Hawaiian land systems. When you’re through I’ll give you your examination . . . sitting in that chair. Are those your schoolbooks?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll never need them again.” Slowly Africa Kee, who loved education, took the books and tore them apart. Throwing them into the wastebasket he said, “When you study your new book you are to memorize the end of every chapter. Hong Kong, you’re going to get an education that no man in Hawaii has ever had before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Ultimately, of course, the Kees did squeeze a boy into Punahou. It happened in a most peculiar way. In 1910 the Republican Party had difficulty finding the right man to run for the legislature from Chinatown and somebody made the radical proposal, “Why don’t we run a Chinaman?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” one of the Hewlett boys protested. “I don’t want that radical Africa Kee in government.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wasn’t thinking of him. I was thinking of his brother Australia.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A hush fell over the caucus and smiles began to play upon the faces of the white men who ran the islands, for Australia was a man whom men could like. He wasn’t too bright, played a good ukulele, was honest, didn’t have too much education but did have a host of friends among both the Chinese and the Hawaiians, with whom he had been reared. Furthermore, he had an appealing nickname, Kangaroo Kee, and without even taking a vote the caucus decided that he was their man.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kangaroo Kee was elected by a huge majority and kept on getting elected, and in time he became the leading Chinese in the Republican Party, a man everyone loved and trusted. Fortunately, he had a son who like himself was gloriously average, and in 1912 Punahou felt that at last it had found a Kee who could be safely admitted to the school.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the day this boy enrolled, Nyuk Tsin walked secretly to the entrance of the school and hid behind one of the palms to watch one of her grandsons at last enter the great school. As she saw the bright faces of the haole children gathering for the beginning of the new term, chatting of vacation experiences, she recognized here a Hale and there a Whipple, and thought: “The white people are crazy to allow Chinese in this school. This is the secret of how they rule the islands and they have a right to protect their interests.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, coming up the street, she saw her grandson walking with his father, the politician Kangaroo Kee, and she withdrew into the shadows, mumbling to herself, “This boy knows nothing. He is not worthy of this great school. But he is our beginning.”</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>FOR THIRTEEN YEARS</span> Kamejiro Sakagawa rose every morning at three-thirty to cut wild plum, storing it for his hot bath. He then ran to work, labored till sunset, ran home and lighted his fire. He now charged two cents for the first ten men to enjoy the clean hot water, a penny each for all who cared to follow. Over the course of a year he obviously earned quite a few dollars, and like all the Japanese laboring on Hanakai he watched with excitement as his hidden funds reached toward the mystic number: $400.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the arrival of the first Japanese back in the 1880’s, it had been agreed that a man who could return to Hiroshima with $400 in cash could thenceforth live like a samurai. “With four hundred dollars,” the workmen assured one another, “a man could buy three good rice fields, build a large house, get all the kimonos you would ever need, and live in splendor.” Every plantation laborer was determined that he would be the man to accumulate the $400, and almost none did.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was appalling how the money slipped through the fingers of a well-intentioned man. In Kamejiro’s case his weaknesses were neither gambling nor women nor alcohol; no, his were far more expensive—friendship and patriotism—and they kept depleting his funds. If a workman faced what appeared to be an insoluble crisis, he went at last to Kamejiro and said bluntly, “I have got to have eighty-one cents.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why don’t you borrow from the Japanese money lender in Kapaa?” Kamejiro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In Kapaa if you borrow eighty-one cents, next payday you have to pay back the loan and eighty-one cents more,” the workman explained, and he was correct. No white man in Hawaii ever abused Oriental labor as viciously as the Orientals themselves did. Men close to the Japanese consulate had organized a racket whereby incoming workmen were required to pay a deposit to safeguard their papers for eventual return to Japan, and the substantial sums of money were kept year after year with no interest, and when the time came to leave, the deposit often could not be found, and some Japanese became very rich. At every point, vicious practices gnawed away the financial security of the workmen, and interest rates of one hundred per cent a month were common. So usually, rugged little Kamejiro had to cough up the money for his friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">Some of the Japanese men had begun to bring brides in from Japan, and this was always costly, throwing unusual burdens upon the whole community. There were photographs to be taken in Kapaa, fares to be paid, travel to Honolulu to complete the paper work, and store-bought black suits in which to be married. The amount of connubial bliss underwritten by stalwart Kamejiro was considerable; and this was a self-defeating game, because he found that as soon as a man and woman got together, there were apt to be babies which caused further financial crises. There was thus a constant drain upon his resources and at times it seemed as if he were paying for the family happiness of everyone but himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">His biggest expenditures, however, arose from patriotism. If a priest came through Kauai telling of a new war memorial, Kamejiro was the man who contributed most heavily. When consular officials from Honolulu appeared to explain the great events transpiring in the homeland, Kamejiro paid their hotel bills. He contributed to the Japanese school, to the Japanese church, and above all to the Japanese reciters who passed through the islands periodically.</p>

  <p class="normal">These men were the joy of Kamejiro’s life, and whenever one was announced he worked with greater speed, impatient for the Sunday afternoon when the entire Japanese community would gather in some park of casuarina trees, sitting on beds of dried needles to wait for the appearance of the reciter. At one-thirty, after the Japanese had enjoyed their lunch of sushi and sashimi, a movable platform of boards, covered by a traditional cloth, was put into position, with a low lectern bearing a closed fan. A hush fell over the crowd, and the visitor from Japan, usually an elderly man with bald head and wide-shouldered starched uniform whose points swept out like butterfly wings, stepped onto the platform in white tabi, bowed many times, and sat on his haunches before the lectern. For some moments he seemed to pray that his voice would be strong, and then, as his audience waited breathless in the sunlight, he picked up the folded fan and began chanting.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I ... shall . . . speak ... of ... the ... Battle ... of ... Ichi-no-tani,” he cried in mournful voice, singing each pregnant word and holding on to it. In those first moments he seemed like an imprisoned volcano, about to burst into wild fury, and as the events of that battle, which had taken place more than seven hundred years before, began to unfold, the man’s voice began to acquire new force. He projected himself into each of the characters in turn; he was the brave warrior Kumagai; he was the handsome youth Atsumori; he was the horse, the cliff, the flute; he was the brilliant hero Yoshitsune; and all the women. As his excitement grew, the veins of his head stood out as if they might burst and his neck muscles could be seen like pencils under the skin. At the various crises of the ancient battle, he roared and whispered, sobbed and screamed with joy; but when it came time for Atsumori to die-- this bewitching young warrior playing a flute--the man reported grief as if it were a tangible thing, and the entire audience wept.</p>

  <p class="normal">How terribly real was the heroism of Japan, there under the casuarina trees. How fair and loyal the women were, how brave the men. And as the battle drew to its tragic conclusion, with the plantation, hands sobbing for the lost dead, the reciter added lines that were not originally part of the epic, but which he had been told were especially appropriate for distant colonies like this one on Kauai: “And … as … the . . . ghost … of … Atsumori . . . left . . . the . . . plain … of … Ichi-no-tani,” the reciter cried mournfully, “he looked back upon the gallant warriors who had slain him and thought: “These are the brave soldiers of Japan, and while they live there is no danger to the homeland. They can march for miles through hardship. They can live on nothing to support their emperor. They fear no enemy and withdraw from no storm. They are the bravest men on earth, fighting for just causes and the glory of Japan. How strong they are, how noble, how fine it is to see them on the battlefield. Oh, how I long to be with them again, the brave warriors of Japan.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">A program consisted of four recitations, and since each lasted more than an hour, with famous ones like Ichi-no-tani requiring nearly two, the afternoon usually crept on toward darkness before the recital ended. How one man, taking so many varied parts and throwing his voice up and down the scale as if by magic, could last five hours was always a mystery, but in time a convention grew up at the Hanakai readings which made the last item on the program the best of all. It was initiated when a reciter announced: Today I have a special reward! The story of Colonel Ito, who threw himself upon the Russian guns at Port Arthur.” And someone remembered that their own Sakagawa Kamejiro had once played the role of Colonel Ito in the victory procession in Honolulu, and he was sent to fetch his uniform; so while the reciter told the impassioned story of Colonel Ito and the Russian guns, Kamejiro, five-feet-one-inch tall and with arms like hoops, stood rigidly at attention beside the platform, wearing the Imperial uniform which had been sewed up by the women of Honolulu. At such moments a strange thing occurred; he became Colonel Ito. He could see the Russian guns and smell their powder. When the emperor spoke as the troops were leaving Tokyo, Kamejiro could hear the august words, and when the colonel died, defending Japan against the barbarians, Kamejiro died, too, and entered the pantheon of heroes. Spiritually he was part of Japan, a warrior who had never yet borne arms, but who stood ready to die for his emperor. It was after such moments of exaltation that he contributed most heavily to war funds and military hospitals and all such good works.</p>

  <p class="normal">The constant pull of Japan and its emotional history was so great that Kamejiro did not know one Japanese who intended remaining in Hawaii. All labored twelve hours a day for seventy-three cents, the pay having been raised, in hopes of returning to Hiroshima with $400 and a bright future, and although from the presence of an increasing number of white-haired men and women it was obvious that the majority never saved enough money to get home, not even the most despairing ever admitted that they had given up hope.</p>

  <p class="normal">One night at the conclusion of a Japanese movie the Buddhist priest called for attention, and a spotlight was thrown upon him by the projectionist. “I want Sakagawa Kamejiro to step forth,” the priest said, and the stocky little workman moved into the lights, blinking and keeping his left fist to his mouth. “His Imperial Majesty’s consulate in Honolulu has directed me,” the priest said, “to award this scroll to Sakagawa Kamejiro in recognition of his contributions on behalf of the brave sailors who lost their lives at the Fukushima catastrophe. All Japan is proud of this man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To Kamejiro the last words were not an empty phrase. He believed that every village in Japan knew of his loyal behavior, and he could visualize word of his deportment creeping to his parents’ home, and he could see how happy they were that their son was a decent Japanese. All Japan was proud of him, and for Kamejiro that was sufficient.</p>

  <p class="normal">For thirteen years&#160; he lived&#160; in&#160; this&#160; manner,&#160; excited&#160; by&#160; his recurring contacts with Japan and hopeful that one day soon he would accumulate the $400 plus the boat fare home; but one spring day in 1915, when the casuarina trees were throwing bright nodules at the tips of their needles, ready for the year’s growth, and when blossoms were coming onto the pineapples nestling in the red earth, Kamejiro heard a bird cry. It was not a sea bird, for he knew their voices as they swept aloft on the spume thrown up by the cliffs. Perhaps it was from Tahiti, where it had been wintering; possibly it was merely crossing Kauai on its way to Alaska for the rich, insect-laden summer months; and Kamejiro never actually saw the bird, but he heard it winging past him and he stopped dead in the middle of the pineapple field and thought: “I am thirty-three years old and the years are flying past me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He entered into a period of terrible depression, and a vision came to him which he could not expel: he saw Yoko waiting in Hiroshima, beside the rice fields, and birds were flying past her, too, and she held out her hands, and mists came from the Inland Sea and obliterated her pleading. For the first time he did not rise at three-thirty, and he failed to tend his hot baths, throwing the job onto a friend. He wandered about, gnawed at by an insatiable hunger, and he contemplated going to Kapaa and the brothels, but he rejected the idea, and at last he worked himself toward the decision that hundreds had made before him: “For a little while I shall forget about returning to Japan, but I will use my money to send for Yoko.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was hoeing pineapple when he made this decision, and it was only two o’clock in the afternoon, but he dropped his hoe and walked in a kind of glorious daze out to the main highway and on into Kapaa, where the ostracized Hashimoto had a photograph shop and an agency for ships traveling to Japan. Smothering his pride and approaching the renegade, Kamejiro said, “I want to get my picture taken to send to Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Go home and shave,” Hashimoto said bluntly. “And wear the dark suit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have no suit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ishii Camp has one. All the men use it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t want to wear a borrowed suit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What girl will want to marry you if you send a photograph without a dark suit?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who said anything about girls?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Obviously, you want to get married. I’m glad for you and will take a fine picture. But shave first and wear the dark suit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much will it all cost?” Kamejiro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Photograph three dollars. Boat fare for the girl seventy. Her train expenses and dresses and the feast back home, maybe seventy. Total one hundred forty-three dollars.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Such an amount would delay the accumulation of $400 by another three or four years at least, and Kamejiro hesitated. “I don’t know about that,” he said. “Please don’t tell anybody.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I take pictures. I talk to nobody.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I may be back,” Kamejiro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will be,” Hashimoto predicted. Then, as he did with all the Japanese who had ostracized him, he added brutally, “You will marry the girl and you will never return to Japan. Make up your mind about that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro swallowed hard and avoided looking at the photographer. “I am going back to Japan,” he said. “You have done me a favor, Hashimoto-san. For a moment I was hungry for a wife and thought: ‘I will spend my money that way.’ But you have shown me what that means. Good night. I won’t be back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But as he left the photographer’s store, a brood of children, half-Japanese, half-Hawaiian, swept past him shouting in a language that no man living could understand—the wild, sweet pidgin of childhood, composed of all languages—and they bumped into him, and a little girl, her hair cut square in the Japanese fashion, cried, “Gomennasai!” and on the impulse of the moment Kamejiro stooped and caught the child, bringing her face to his, and for an instant she remained limp in his arms. Then she kicked free and cried in Hawaiian and Portuguese, “I must go with the others!” And from the doorway, Hashimoto, still hating the men who had driven him out, laughed and said, “It was my daughter you were holding. I have six children, four of them boys.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In great agitation Kamejiro walked home, and the smell of the little girl’s hair burned his nostrils so that when he reached the camp and saw the long, bleak, womanless barracks in which he had been living for thirteen years, he .rushed directly to Ishii-san and said, “You must write a letter home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you thinking of getting married?” the scribe asked, for he recognized the symptoms.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Unexpectedly, the thin little letter-writer grasped Kamejiro’s hand and confided: “I have been thinking the same thing. What would it cost?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not much!” Kamejiro cried excitedly. “Photograph three dollars. Fare seventy. Maybe a hundred and forty-three altogether.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to do it!” Ishii-san announced. “I’ve been thinking about it all this year.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So have I,” Kamejiro confessed, and he sat upon the floor as Ishii-san got out his brushes: “Dear Mother, I have decided to take a wife and later I will send you my photograph so that you can show it to Yoko-chan and she can see how I look now. When you tell me that she is willing to come to Hawaii, I will send the money. This does not mean that I am not going to come back home. It only means that I shall stay here a little longer. Your faithful son, Kamejiro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It took nine weeks to receive an answer to this letter, and when it arrived Kamejiro was stunned by its contents, for his mother wrote: “You must be a stupid boy to think that Yoko-chan would still be waiting. She got married twelve years ago and already has five children, three of them sons. What made you suppose that a self-respecting girl would wait? But that is no loss, for as you can see I am sending you the photograph of a very fine young lady named Sumiko who has said that she would marry you. She is from this village and will make a lovely wife. Please send the money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A photograph four inches by three fluttered to the bed, face down. For several moments Kamejiro allowed it to lie there, unable to comprehend that when he turned it over it would show not Yoko, whom he had kept enshrined in his memory, but some girl he had never known. Gingerly, and with two fingers, he lifted the edge of the picture and dropped his head sideways to peer at it. Suddenly he flipped it over and shouted, “Oh! Look at this beautiful girl! Look at her!”</p>

  <p class="normal">A crowd gathered to study the photograph, and some protested: “That girl will never marry a clod like you, Kamejiro!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell them what the letter says!” Kamejiro instructed Ishii-san, and the scribe read aloud the facts of the case. The girl’s name was Sumiko, and she was willing to marry Kamejiro.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is she a Hiroshima girl?” a suspicious man inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s from Hiroshima-ken,” Kamejiro replied proudly, and a sigh of contentment rose from the long bunkhouse.</p>

  <p class="normal">On one person the photograph of Kamejiro’s good luck had a depressing effect, for in an earlier mail Ishii-san had received a picture of the bride his parents had picked for him. She was a girl called Mori Yoriko, which was a pleasing name, but her photograph showed her to be one of those square-faced, stolid, pinch-eyed peasant girls that Japan seemed to produce in unlimited numbers. Ishii-san’s mother assured him that Mori Yoriko could work better than a man and saved money, but the scribe felt that there was more to marriage than that, especially when, as in his case, the husband could read and write. He was patently disappointed and asked to see Kamejiro’s picture again. Sumiko, as he studied her, appeared to have the classic type of beauty: gently slanted eyes, fine cheekbones, low forehead, pear-shaped face and delicate features. She looked like the girls whose pictures were painted on the sheets advertising Japanese historical movies, and Ishii-san said, “She’s very pretty for a Hiroshima girl. Maybe she’s from the city.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Kamejiro assured him. “My mother would never send a city girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The next day the two would-be husbands borrowed Ishii Camp’s publicly owned black suit, the tie that went with it, and the white shirt; they wrapped their treasure in a Sheet, hired a taxi and drove into Kapaa, where Hashimoto the photographer told them, “Take turns with the suit, and be sure to comb your hair.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kamejiro climbed into the strange clothes, Hashimoto had to show him how to tie the tie, after which the stocky field hand plastered his hair down with a special grease Hashimoto provided for that purpose. Kamejiro then moved into range of the camera, posing rigidly and refusing to smile. The finished picture, even though it was properly styled and mounted, would have excited few prospective brides, and Hashimoto did not consider it one of his best. Nevertheless, Kamejiro mailed it with a fully paid ticket from Tokyo to Honolulu. Then he waited.</p>

  <p class="normal">In late 1915 Ishii-san and Kamejiro received notice that their brides were arriving at Honolulu on the old Japanese freighter Kyoto-maru. The news did not occasion the joy that might have been expected, because it had been hoped at the camp that the two girls might arrive by separate ships, for then each husband, when he went to get his wife, could have worn the black suit, thus corresponding to the photographs sent to Japan. As things now stood, one man would wear the suit and not disappoint his bride, but the other would clearly have to wear his laboring clothes and stand before his bride as he really was. It was the character of Kamejiro to say quickly to his friend, “Since you can read and write, it is proper for you to wear the suit.” And the camp agreed that this was the only logical solution.</p>

  <p class="normal">The lovers, alternately ardent and afraid, left Lihue by the small ship Kilauea and went to Honolulu, where they took one room in a dingy Japanese inn on Hotel Street. Since they arrived on the evening before the Kyoto-maru was expected, they ate a meager supper of rice and fish, then hiked up Nuuanu and bowed low before the symbol of their emperor. As they were doing so an official in black cutaway hustled out on some important meeting and snapped: “Don’t stand around here like peasants. Go about your work.” Obediently the men left.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were impressed by the big homes on Beretania Street but were shocked by the dirty alleys of Chinatown, where one miserable hovel leaned against the next. Ishii-san said, “They told me that fifteen years ago this whole neighborhood was burned down and the Chinese wanted to rebuild it like a proper city without alleys and mean houses, but the white people wanted it the way it was before, so it was built that way again.” The two men, recalling the clean roads and immaculate homes of their childhood, shook their heads at the white man’s ways.</p>

  <p class="normal">Before they went to sleep that night Ishii-san spread before him the two photographs, and he spent a long time comparing them, and his disappointment at the tricks of fate became apparent in his features. “My mother didn’t choose very well, I’m afraid,” he said. “Isn’t it strange, Kamejiro, to think that a great ship out there is bringing a woman with whom you will spend the rest of your life?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m nervous,” Kamejiro confessed, but his nervousness that night was nothing to what he would experience during the next days; for when the Kyoto-maru docked, the seven Japanese men who had come to meet their picture brides were told, “We never let the women out of quarantine for three days.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can’t we even see them?” Ishii-san implored.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No contact of any kind,” the immigration man warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, the ardent grooms found that if they bribed one of the attendants, they could press their faces against a hole the size of a half-dollar that had been bored into the door behind which the incoming brides were imprisoned, and the third man in line was Kamejiro. Squinting so as to make his eye smaller, he peered through the miserable peephole and saw seven women idly sitting and standing in groups. He looked from one to the other and was unable to detect which was Sumiko, and he looked back beseechingly at the guard who spoke no Japanese. Applying his eye once more to the circle, he looked avidly at the seven women, but again he could not isolate his intended wife, and in some confusion he turned the peephole over to his successor.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is she beautiful?” Ishii-san asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Very,” Kamejiro assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you see Yoriko?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think so.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does she look pretty good?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She looks very healthy,” Kamejiro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Ishii-san left the peephole he was trembling. “She’s a lot bigger than I am,” he mumbled. “Damn my mother!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, Ishii-san!” Kamejiro protested. “She’s a Hiroshima girl. She’s bound to make a good wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the second and third days the men returned to spy upon their wives, and by a process of elimination Kamejiro discovered whom he was to marry. He had failed at first to find her because she was by all odds the loveliest of the girls and he had not been able to believe that she was intended for him. Commiserating with his friend Ishii-san’s disappointment, he had the delicacy not to revel in the beauty of his own wife; but as the hours passed, leading up to the moment when the doors would be thrown open, he became frightfully nervous and excited.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am beginning to feel sick!” he told Ishii-san.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I already am,” the letter-writer confided.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think I may go away and come back later,” Kamejiro whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait a minute!” one of the husbands snapped. “Look at the poor women!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro felt himself shoved to the peephole and for the last time he saw the seven brides. They knew that the hour of meeting was at hand, and the bravery that had marked their earlier behavior now fled. Without adequate water or combs, they made pathetic attempts to pretty themselves. They smoothed down one another’s rumpled, sea-worn dresses, and tucked in ends of hair. One woman applied her fingertips to her forehead, as if she considered it ugly, and tried to spread its skin more smoothly over the heavy bones. In the corner one girl wept, and after a brief attempt at trying to console her, the others left her alone with her misery. But there was one thing that each girl in her final moments of panic did: she studied the photograph clutched in her hand and desperately tried to memorize the features of the man she was about to meet. She was determined that she would know him and that she would walk up to him unerringly and bow before him. But now all were weeping and the photographs were blurred.</p>

  <p class="normal">A gong rang and Kamejiro jumped back from the door. Slowly the hinges swung open and the brides came forth. No tears were visible. The placid faces under the mounds of black hair looked steadily, inquiringly forward, and the first sound heard was a muffled gasp of pain. “Oh!” one of the brides sighed. “You are so much older than the picture.”</p>

  <a id="section_3"></a>

  <p class="normal">“It was taken a long time ago,” the man explained. “But I will be a good husband.” He held out his hand, and the girl, controlling herself, bowed until her head almost touched his knees. They formed the first pair.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next girl, the one who had been weeping alone in the comer, walked straight to her man, smiled and bowed low. “I am Fumiko,” she said. “Your mother sends a thousand blessings.” And she formed up the second pair.</p>

  <p class="normal">The third girl was Mori Yoriko, Ishii-san’s bride, and as he had feared, she was much more robust than he. She was a true Hiroshima country girl, red-cheeked, square-faced, squint-eyed. Knowing that she was less beautiful than any of the others, she made up for her deficiencies in stalwart courage and a burning desire to make herself into a good wife. She found Ishii-san and bowed low, her big hands held close to her knees. “Mr. Ishii,” she whispered, “I bring you the love of your mother.” Then, as if she knew reassurance was necessary, she quickly added in a halting whisper, “I will be a good wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The last girl to find her husband was Sumiko, the prettiest of the lot, and her recalcitrance sprang not from any lack of wit but from the shock she had received when she first saw Kamejiro. He did not wear the black suit in which he had been photographed, nor was his hair pasted down. His clothes were those of a mean peasant and his arms were brutally awkward. He was grim-faced, like an angry, stupid man, and he was twice as old as she had expected. Last in line, and with only one man unattached, Sumiko obviously knew who her husband was, but she refused to accept the fact.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” she cried imperiously. “That one is not my man!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh!” Kamejiro gasped. “I am Sakagawa Kamejiro. I have your picture.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She slapped it from his hand and then threw hers upon it, stamping upon them. “I will not marry this man. I have been deceived.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this outburst the first bride, who had also found a husband she did not want, shook Sumiko and cried in rapid Japanese, “Control yourself, you selfish little fool! In such an affair who expects to find a champion?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will not marry this animal!” Sumiko wailed, whereupon the first bride, who had gracefully accepted her disappointment, delivered a solid slap across the girl’s face.</p>

  <p class="normal">“On the entire trip you were a mean, nasty child. You ought to be ashamed. Go to that good man and humble yourself before him.” The first bride placed her hand in the middle of Sumiko’s back and projected her across the hushed immigration room.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sumiko would have stumbled except that from the astonished couples Ishii-san sprang forth to rescue her. He caught her by the waist and held her for a moment. Then, looking at Kamejiro and his own intended bride, he said with a frankness that startled even himself, “Kamejiro, you and Yoriko make a better pair. Give me Sumiko.” And the beautiful girl, finding herself in the presence of a cultured man who wore a black suit, suddenly cried, “Yes, Kamejiro, you are too old for me. Please, please!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In stolid bewilderment, Kamejiro looked down at the picture and recalled how deeply over the past months he had grown to love it. Then he looked up at the square-faced chapped-cheeked Mori Yoriko and thought: “She is not the girl in the picture. What are they doing to me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He hesitated, the room whirling about him, and then he felt on his arm the hand of the first bride, who had slapped Sumiko, and this quiet-voiced girl was saying, “I do not know your name, but I have lived with Yoriko for three weeks, and of all the brides here, I assure you that she will make the best wife. Take her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The humiliated country girl, who had been so painfully rejected by her intended husband, found tears welling into her unpretty eyes, and she wanted to run to some corner, but she stood firm like the rock from which she had been hewn and bowed low before the stranger. “I will be a good wife,” she mumbled, fighting to control her voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro looked for the last time at the well-remembered picture on the floor, then picked it up and handed it to his friend Ishii-san. “It will be better this way,” he said. Returning to the girl who still bowed, he said gently, “My name is Sakagawa Kamejiro. I am from Hiroshima-ken.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My name is Mori Yoriko,” the peasant girl answered. “I also am from Hiroshima.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then we will get married,” he said, and the seven couples were completed.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>DURING THE YEARS</span> when Kamejiro Sakagawa and his bride Yoriko were discovering how lucky they were to have stumbled into their&#160; improvised&#160;&#160; marriage,&#160;&#160; the&#160;&#160; missionary&#160;&#160; families&#160;&#160; in&#160;&#160; Honolulu were experiencing a major shock, for one of their sons was proving to be a fiery radical, and reports of his behavior startled all Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">In these years Hawaii seemed filled with Hales and Whipples and Hewletts and Janderses and Hoxworths. In some classes at Punahou sixteen out of twenty-four students would bear these or related names. Only skilled genealogists tried to keep the blood lines straight, for Hales were Hoxworths and Hoxworths were Whipples, and fairly frequently a Hale would marry a Hale and thus intensify the complications, so that in time no child really understood who his various cousins were, and an island euphemism gained popularity: “He is my calabash cousin,” which meant that if one went back far enough, some kind of blood relationship could be established.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hawaii came to consider this Hale-Whipple-Hewlett-Janders-Hoxworth menage simply as “the family” and to recognize its four salient characteristics: its children went to Punahou; its boys went to Yale; invariably it found some kind of good-paying job for every son and for the husband of every daughter; and members of the family tried to avoid scandal. Therefore, when one of the boys became a radical, the family was deeply jolted.</p>

  <p class="normal">As long as he had stayed at Punahou, this renegade had done well, but this was not unusual, for the family expected its sons to prosper there. Take the case of Hoxworth Whipple, who gained international honors for his work on Polynesian history. He started his scholarly investigation while still at Punahou, although later he took his B.A. at Yale, his M.A. at Harvard, his Ph.D. from Oxford and his D.Litt. from the Sorbonne. He received honorary degrees from eleven major universities, but when he died in 1914 the Honolulu Mail announced simply: “The great scholar was educated at Punahou.” None of the rest really mattered.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the year that the great scholar died, crowded with honors, the young member of the family who was to become the radical was graduating from Punahou. He was Hoxworth Hale, in all outward respects a typical sixteen-year-old boy. He was neither tall nor short, fat nor thin. His hair was not black nor was it blond, and his eyes displayed no single prominent color. He was not at the top of his class nor yet at the bottom, and he was outstanding in no one scholastic accomplishment. He had played games moderately well but had never won fist fights against boys larger than himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Young Hoxworth Hale, named after the noted scholar, was most noted for the fact that he had uncommonly pretty sisters, Henrietta and Jerusha, and they lent him a spurious popularity which he would not otherwise have enjoyed. There was a good deal of chivvying to see which of his friends would win the favors of the charming sisters, and of course in later years his younger sister became engaged to one of her calabash cousins, a Whipple, whereupon Hoxworth’s father told the family, “I think it’s high time somebody married a stranger. Get some new blood into this tired old tree.” His words were not taken in good grace, because he had married his cousin, a Hoxworth girl, and it was felt that he was casting aspersions upon her; nevertheless, when his oldest daughter began displaying outward tendencies and actually became engaged to a man named Gage from Philadelphia, he expressed his pleasure. But later Henrietta met a boy from New Hampshire named Bromley and the two discovered that way, way back her great-great-great-great-grandfather Charles Bromley and his great-great-great . . . well, anyway, she felt a lot more congenial with Bromley than she ever had with her fiance Gage, so she married the former because, as she pointed out, “he seems more like one of the family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When young Hoxworth Hale left Punahou it was understood that he would go on to Yale, and in New Haven this undistinguished youth was to explode into a prominence no one had anticipated. Not having wasted his limited intellectual reserves in preparatory school, he was ready to blossom in college and gradually became both a scholar and a polished gentleman. In his grades he did markedly better than boys who had surpassed him at Punahou, while in sports he captained the polo team and served as assistant manager of the basketball team. He acquired the lesser amenities and in politics ran successfully for president of his class.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was this unlikely youth who became the radical. His commitment began one day in his junior year when a Professor Albers from Leipzig was ending a lecture on the theory of imperialism with this shrewd observation: “The Congregational-Church-cum-Boston-merchant invasion and capture of Hawaii is the exact counterpart of the Catholic-Church-cum-Paris-entrepreneur rape of Tahiti. The proof of this analogy lies, I think, in the demonstrated manner whereby the missionaries who went to Hawaii, though they did not call in the American gunboats as did their French cousins in Tahiti, nevertheless, by revolutionary means, stole the land from the Hawaiians and wound up possessors of the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Professor Albers’ class contained, in addition to young Hoxworth Hale, his calabash cousin Hewlett Janders, two Whipples and a Hewlett, but these other descendants of the missionaries were content to stare in embarrassment at their arm rests. Not so Hoxworth; he coughed once, coughed twice, then boldly interrupted: “Professor Albers, I’m sorry but I’m afraid you have your facts wrong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I beg your pardon,” the German professor spluttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I mean that whereas your facts on Tahiti may be correct, those on Hawaii are definitely in error.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you stand when you address remarks to your professor?” the Leipzig-trained scholar demanded, growing red. When Hoxworth got to his feet, Albers referred to his notes and began quoting an impressive list of sources: “The journals of Ellis, Jarves, Bird, the researches of Amsterfield, de Golier, Whipple. They all tell the same story.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If they do,” Hoxworth said, “they’re all wrong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Professor Albers flushed and asked, “What is your name, young man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hoxworth Hale, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well!” Albers laughed. ‘Tour testimony on this matter is hardly unimpeachable.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This contempt goaded Hale into making a reply that infuriated the professor: “You cited Jarves. Have you ever read Jarves?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do not cite sources I have not read,” Albers fumed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jarves happened to be a friend of some of my ancestors, and they held him in keen regard because he was the first impartial observer to defend the missionaries, and I’ve read what he wrote, in the original papers in which he wrote it, and what he wrote, sir, simply doesn’t support your thesis.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The class broke up in something of a scandal and for some weeks the word missionary had a curious force of its own at Yale. Professor Albers, goaded by his young tormentor, marshaled an impressive battery of anti-clerical critics whose gibes at all churches and their nefarious skill in capturing the land of backward countries pleased the young iconoclasts of that day, and for several biting weeks the professor carried the day, and the dormitories rang with the famous gibes against the Hawaiian missionaries: “They came to the island to do good, and they did right well.” “No wonder the islands were lighter when they left; they stole everything in sight.” “They taught the natives to wear dresses and sign leases.” And most cutting of all: “Before the missionaries came to Hawaii, there were four hundred thousand happy, naked natives in the mountains killing each other, practicing incest, and eating well. After the missionaries had been there awhile, there were thirty thousand fully clothed, miserable natives, huddled along the shore, paying lip service to Christianity and owning nothing.” In Professor Albers’ classes such lines of reasoning became increasingly popular, and for the first time Yale, the source of missionaries, took a serious look at what they had really accomplished. In those exciting days it was downright unpleasant to be a Whipple or a Hewlett, for the fact was often cited that Dr. John Whipple had abandoned the church to become a millionaire, and that Hewlett had left to steal land from the defenseless natives.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the fifth week of the intellectual investigation, Hoxworth Hale, then a junior, nineteen years old, asked for time to read to the class the results of some work he had been doing on his account, and in cold, dispassionate phrases he developed this thesis: “In the third decade of the last century a series of little ships brought missionaries to Hawaii. There were twelve ships in all, bearing a total of fifty-two ordained missionaries, brought to the islands at a cost of $1,220,000. At the end of nearly thirty years of religious and social service in the islands, the missionaries controlled practically no land, except in the case of one Abraham Hewlett who had married a Hawaiian lady and whose family lands have always been kept in her name for the welfare of her people. The Whipples owned no land whatever. Nor did the Hales except, in later days, a few building lots on which their homes have been built. In fact, in 1854 the Hawaiian government took cognizance of the unfortunate position of the mission families and passed a special law allowing those who had served the islands well to buy small parcels of land at favorable prices. And the government did this, Professor Albers, because they were afraid not that the missionaries would take over the islands, but that they would go back to America and take their children with them. The minutes of the government on this matter are explicit: ‘June, 1851, the missionaries who have received and applied for lands have neither received nor applied for them without offering what they considered a fair compensation for them. So far as their applications have been granted, your Majesty’s government have dealt with them precisely as they have dealt with other applications for land. It will not be contended that missionaries, because they are missionaries, have not the same right to buy land in the same quantities and at the same prices as those who are not missionaries. But, besides what is strictly due to them, in justice and in gratitude for large benefits conferred by them on your people, every consideration of sound policy, under the rapid decrease of the native population, is in favor of holding out inducements for them not to withdraw their children from these islands. We propose a formal resolution declaring the gratitude of this nation to the missionaries for the services they have performed, and making some provision to insure that their children remain in these islands.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Hoxworth looked directly at his professor and continued: “Dr. Albers, the provisions of this resolution were carried out, and the investigating committee found that the missionaries who had worked so long in Hawaii had acquired so little that the community as a whole applauded when the government provided that any missionary who had served in the islands for eight years be allowed to buy 560 acres of government lands at a price of fifty cents an acre lower than what the average white newcomer would have to pay. Since the average price at that time was $1.45 an acre, this represents a reduction of exactly 34.5 per cent, or one per cent per year for arduous and faithful service. So far as I can find, the missionaries acquired land in absolutely no other way, and even so, most of them were then too poor to take advantage of the government’s offer.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hawaii desperately wanted the mission families to stay in the islands, and it has been justly said that the most significant crop grown by the missionaries was not sugar, but their sons. Now, if you want to argue that the brilliant young mission sons who left Hawaii, studied here at Yale and then returned to the islands, usurped a disproportionate number of important jobs in medicine, law, government and management, you would be on good grounds, but if you do so argue, don’t blame the missionaries. Blame Yale.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I conclude that it is neither fair nor accurate to accuse these families of stealing land which they never came into possession of. It was the non-mission families, the New England sea rovers, who got the land. Then, the land having been obtained by these men, it is true that mission sons managed it, for a fee, but would you have it lie fallow? The facts you cite apply to Tahiti. They simply do not apply to Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat down, flushed with excitement, and expected the applause of his classmates for having dared argue with the arrogant professor, but what Hoxworth had said was not popular. It ran against the grain of the age and was not believed. Jokes about missionaries continued, and Hale saw that whereas he had gained nothing with his contemporaries he had placed himself at a serious disadvantage with the faculty. But what grieved him most was that his Punahou associates, Hewlett Janders and the others, felt rather ashamed that a subject which would have died with only momentary embarrassment had now been so thoroughly ventilated as to force all members of the class to be either anti-missionary or pro, and nearly everyone fell into the first category, and the Punahou men were infuriated that one of their own number had stirred up the mess.</p>

  <p class="normal">So Hoxworth Kale’s first venture into public argument backfired rather badly, but his studies had disclosed to him his ancestors, so that no matter how witty the gibes against missionaries became, he knew what the facts were, and this knowledge, in the subtle way that knowledge has, fortified him in many ways and made him a stronger man.</p>

  <p class="normal">His preoccupation with researches into Hawaiian history developed an accidental concomitant which outraged all of Yale and led to his temporary withdrawal from the university. He was in the library one day, reading files of an early Honolulu newspaper, the Polynesian, for he wished to refresh his mind as to what that journal’s excitable editor, James Jackson Jarves, had actually said about missionaries, and for a while he got bogged down in the story of how Jarves had protested when a French warship roared into Honolulu, insisting that French wines be imported in unlimited amounts, and of how the French authorities threatened to lash him through the streets with a cat-o’-nine-tails. Next he turned the yellowed pages to read of the time when the British consul actually did horsewhip poor Jarves for defending Hawaii against British intrusions into local affairs, and he began to laugh to himself: “Jarves must have been a wild-eyed young man . . . like me.” And the conceit pleased him, and he felt sympathy for the strange, will-o’-the-wisp editor who had so befriended Hawaii and the missionaries, until he suddenly looked at the name again: James Jackson Jarves! Hadn’t he heard that name in another context?</p>

  <p class="normal">He hurried from the library and went to the exhibition hall where one of the glories of Yale University stood: the collection of early Italian masterpieces gathered together by a curious man named James Jackson Jarves, who had lived in Florence in the 1850’s. Hoxworth hurried into the gallery and walked among the strange, faraway, gold and blue painting of an age he could not even begin to comprehend. He was unprepared to like the art he saw in the Jarves collection, and he did not try to do so, for it was in no way similar to the work of Raphael and Rembrandt, which he had been taught was true art; but as he gazed at the affectionate little paintings—more than a hundred of them—he sensed that they had been, collected by someone who had loved them, and he asked an attendant, “Who was this man Jarves?” The man didn’t know, so Hale sought out another, and finally the curator: “Who was Jarves?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The curator had a brief memorandum on the forgotten donor and said, “An American writer on art who lived in Florence in the middle years of the last century. A close friend of Elizabeth and Robert Browning and John Ruskin. In his own way, an eminent man, and America’s first writer on art.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did he ever live in Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. But late in life he did write the first book in English on Japanese art. He discovered prints as art forms so he must have lived in the Orient, although I have no knowledge of the fact.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hawaii isn’t in the Orient,” Hale explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Isn’t it considered part of Asia?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Hale replied sharply and left. In those days he did not think much of faculty members.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was puzzled. It seemed most unlikely that two men of such dissimilar natures as the rambunctious Hawaiian editor and the polished Italian art connoisseur could have been the same man, and yet there was the name: James Jackson Jarves; so he continued his researches and discovered at last that his Hawaiian Jarves had failed to make a living with his Polynesian and had fled in disgust to Florence, where he became the first great American collector of paintings, the first American art philosopher, and the first writer on Japanese aesthetics. He felt a proprietary interest in the strange man and thought: “That’s not bad for a Hawaii boy!”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, as he looked into the peculiar circumstances whereby Yale acquired the Jarves paintings, he became appalled at the unsavory tricks the college had used to steal them, and he forgot all about the missionaries and began digging into the events of 1871, when the former editor of the Polynesian was fifty-three years old and in sore need of money. Yale had loaned him $20,000 on his paintings, and he had been unable to repay the debt, so the college put the entire collection up for public auction, 119 masterpieces in all, worth $70,000 or $80,000 then . . . over a million dollars in 1917. But college authorities had quietly forewarned potential bidders that any buyer must take the entire collection in one lump, and the rumor had circulated that even if this were done, the college would not yield clear title to the pictures, so that any prospective buyer must beware of lawsuits; and on the day of the sale there were no bidders, and Yale acquired the collection for what Jarves owed the college.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is a scandal!” Hoxworth cried, and to his amazement he found himself deeply involved in art problems, and now when he passed through the Jarves collection, he thought: “These marvelous masterworks!” He wrote a long letter to the college paper, asking why a college with Yale’s background should have conspired at such a nasty business, and hell broke loose.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth was defamed on the Yale campus as a radical who had raped the reputation of his own college; but a Boston art critic wrote: “The general outline of the facts so patiently developed by young Mr. Hale have long been known in art circles but hitherto they have not been publicly aired, out of courtesy to a revered institution whose deportment Otherwise has been above reproach.” So once more one of the most essentially conservative young men Hawaii ever sent to Yale found himself the center of controversy, and this one far exceeded in general interest his spirited defense of the missionaries, for it involved the honor of the university itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the height of the controversy the campus newspaper evolved a logical way for Hoxworth to apologize, but just as he had refused to accommodate himself to Professor Albers’ erroneous data on Hawaii, so he now refused to condone what Yale had done to his favorite Hawaiian editor, James Jackson Jarves. Yale had stolen the pictures, and Hoxworth bluntly reiterated his charges. And then late one afternoon as he walked disconsolately through the collection a completely new thought came to him: “It really doesn’t matter to Jarves now whether Yale stole the pictures or not, just as it doesn’t matter whether the missionaries stole the land or not. What counts, and the only thing that counts is this: What good did the institution accomplish? If Yale had not picked up the pictures, forcibly perhaps, where would they be now? Could they possibly have served the wonderful purposes they serve here in New Haven? If the missionaries had stepped aside and allowed Hawaii to drift from one degeneracy to another, what good would have been accomplished? Yale is better by far for having had such a solid beginning for its art school, and Hawaii is better for having had the missionaries. The minor blemishes on the record are unimportant. It doesn’t matter what an arrogant fool like Albers says. Janders and the rest were right to ignore him. The fact is that in Hawaii today there are sugar plantations, and pineapple, and deep reservoirs and a lot of different people living together reasonably well. If Yale stole the pictures, they’re entitled to them because of the good use to which they put them. And I’m not going to argue with anyone any more about the missionaries stealing Hawaii. If they did, which I don’t admit, they certainly put what they stole to good purposes.” He saw then, that gloomy afternoon when he was being hammered by his friends, that there were many ways to judge the acts of an institution, and the pragmatic way was not the worst, by any means.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thus he started his education, that marvelous, growing, aching process whereby a mind develops into a usable instrument with a collection of proved experience from which to function, and he was suddenly tired of Yale, and Punahou men, and professors trained at Leipzig, and problems relating to James Jackson Jarves. Consequently, he walked casually out of the gallery, nodded a grave farewell to the pictures he would never bother to see again, and reported to the New Haven post office where, on April 28, 1917, he enlisted in the army and went to France.</p>

  <p class="normal">ON <span>AUGUST</span> 19, 1916, an event occurred which was to change the history of Hawaii, but as in the case of most such events, it was not so recognized at the time. It happened because one of the German lunas was both drunk and suffering from a toothache, the latter condition having occasioned the former.</p>

  <p class="normal">Normally, the plantation lunas were a tough, cynical, reasonably well-behaved lot. Imported mostly from Germany and Norway—with one man sending for his brother and both calling upon a cousin, so that luna families were constantly being refreshed from the old country—they were employed by firms like Janders &amp; Whipple to supervise field hands for two reasons. It was unthinkable that an Oriental could rise above minor roles, partly because few ever learned to speak English and partly because none intended to remain in Hawaii, but mostly because haoles could not visualize Chinese or Japanese in positions of authority. And from sad experience, the great plantation owners had discovered that the Americans they could get to serve as lunas were positively no good. Capable Americans expected office jobs and incapable ones were unable to control the Oriental field hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore Hawaii was forced to import Europeans to run the plantations, and if the upper crust of Hawaiian society consisted of New England families like the Hales and the Whipples, the second and operating layer was built of Europeans who had once been lunas but who had now left the plantations for businesses of their own. Of the Europeans, the Germans were the greatest successes, both as lunas and as subsequent citizens, and it was ironic that the historical event of which I speak should have been precipitated by a German, but his toothache can probably be blamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was on his way through Ishii Camp at six o’clock one morning, his boots polished and his white ducks freshly pressed. Of late he had been pestered by Japanese laborers in the long bunkhouses who had taken to guzzling large amounts of soy sauce in order to induce temporary fevers, which excused them from work that day, and he was determined to end this farce. If a man claimed a fever, he personally had to breathe in the face of the German luna, and God help him if he smelled of soy sauce.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the nineteenth century, lunas had had a fairly free hand in abusing Oriental labor, and there were instances in which sadistic foremen lashed the pigtails of two Chinese together and tied the knot to a horse’s tail, whipping the beast as he dragged the terrified Orientals through the red dust. Other lunas had formed a habit of beating either Chinese or Japanese as one would thrash a recalcitrant child, and by such methods the Europeans had maintained a ruthless dictatorship of the cane fields, but with the coming of pineapple, where an abused man seeking revenge could easily pass down a row of flowering plants and knock off hundreds of the tiny individual flowers, so that the resulting fruit would lack some of the small squares of which it should have been built, the lunas by and large surrendered their old prerogatives of lash and fist, and life in the plantations was not too bad.</p>

  <p class="normal">But on August 19, 1916, this German luna found two of his Japanese suffering from “soy-sauce fever,” and he cuffed them out to the fields, temperature or no. He then left the long barracks where bachelors stayed and entered the wooden house where Kamejiro Sakagawa and his wife Yoriko lived, and to his disgust he found the former in bed. The luna did not stop to recall that for fourteen years Kamejiro had never once requested a day off for illness, so that malingering was not likely. All the German saw was another Japanese in bed, claiming a fever.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You breathe my face,” he growled in thick pidgin.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro, who did not even know of the soy-sauce trick, failed to grasp the instructions, which convinced the luna of his perfidy. Shaking the little laborer, he shouted again, “You breathe my face!” He leaned over the bed, and since the wife Yoriko had felt sorry for her stricken husband and had both bathed him and fed him some rice and soy sauce, the unmistakable odor of the strong black sauce struck the luna’s nose, and something in what he interpreted as the mock-bewilderment of the little Japanese infuriated him, and with a judgment clouded by alcohol and his own substantial pain, he dragged the sick man from his bed and began thrashing him with the whip most lunas carried.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had struck Kamejiro some dozen blows, none of them very effective because of the crowded nature of the cabin, when he realized from Mrs. Sakagawa’s behavior and the flushed appearance of her husband that perhaps the man really was sick. But he had launched a specific course of action and found himself incapable of turning back. “Get dressed,” he growled, and as bewildered Kamejiro, sick for the first time in Hawaii, climbed into his clothes, the luna stood over him, flexing the whip. He drove Kamejiro out of the cabin and into the pineapple fields, announcing to ‘the others: “Soy-sauce pilikia pau! Plenty pau!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro, with a high fever, worked till noon and then staggered to one knee. “He’s fainting!” the Japanese cried, and work stopped while they hauled him back to his cabin. The German luna, frightened by this twist of events, hurried for the plantation doctor and said, “You’ve got to say it was soy-sauce fever. We’ve got to stick together.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The doctor, an old hack who had proved himself unable to hold down any other job, understood, but he was nevertheless appalled at the high fever in the Japanese, and before he publicly announced that the man had been malingering, he dosed him well. Then he supported the luna and gave a stormy lecture in pidgin against the evils of drinking soy sauce. But when he rode back with the luna he warned: “The little bastard won’t die this time, but sometimes they really are sick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can you tell?” the German asked, and so far as he was concerned the incident was closed.</p>

  <p class="normal">But not for Kamejiro Sakagawa. For fourteen years he had given his employer the kind of loyalty that all Japanese are expected to give their superiors. Every monologue delivered by the frenetic, baldheaded reciter dealt with the loyalty that an inferior owed his master. The suicides, the immolations and the feat of Colonel Ito at Port Arthur had all stemmed from this sense of obedience, and the reason that reciters came from Tokyo to such remote areas as Kauai was that the Imperial government wanted to remind all Japanese of their undying loyalty to superiors, in this case the emperor and his army. None had mastered the lesson more firmly than Kamejiro; to him loyalty and rectitude were inborn nature, and the high point of his life continued to be the moment when he dressed in Colonel Ito’s uniform to stand at attention while the chanters screamed the story: “Colonel Ito and the Russian Guns at Port Arthur.” In his dream life, Kamejiro was that colonel.</p>

  <p class="normal">But what had happened to him now? When the fever abated he mumbled to his closest friends, “The worst part was not the whip, although it stung. But when I had fallen on the floor, he kicked me! With his shoe!”</p>

  <p class="normal">If the German luna had been asked by a judge if this had truly happened, he would not have known, for to him the kick was of no significance. But to a Japanese it was an insult past enduring. It was no use to argue with Kamejiro that a kick was no worse than a thrashing from a whip. He knew that in Japanese recitations the most terrifying scene came when the villain, having knocked the hero down, takes off his zori and ceremoniously strikes the fallen hero, for then men like Kamejiro gasped, knowing that only death could avenge this ultimate insult.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He kicked you?” one of the older men asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“An ignorant, uneducated German kicked a Japanese?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All Japan will be ashamed of this day,” the visitor mumbled and sharing this shame, departed.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Sakagawas were left alone, Kamejiro turned his face to the wall and began to sob. He could not understand what had happened, but he knew that revenge of some kind was imperative. As his visitor had clearly said, “All Japan will be ashamed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His lumpy, square-faced wife understood the agony he felt and tried by various gentle means to placate him and poultice with kindness his festering sores, but she accomplished nothing, and at sunset her husband announced his plan: “I will borrow Ishii-san’s sword, and after the darkness has fallen I will creep to the luna’s house and on his front steps I will cut out my bowels. This will bring him great shame and the honor of Japan will be restored.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Yoriko pleaded. “This stupid German would not understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When he stumbles upon my body in the morning, he will understand,” Kamejiro replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Yoriko wept. She had not yet lived with her husband for a year, but she had found him to be one of the finest men she had ever known or heard of. He was kind and jovial. He saved his money and was generous with friends. He got drunk sometimes but fell into laughing fits when he did and had to lean on her to get home. And at all public gatherings of the Japanese, he represented the honor of the homeland. In his uniform of Colonel Ito he was as handsome a man as she had seen, and she did not want him, not even for the honor of his country, to commit hara-kiri before the house of a clod like the German luna.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kamejiro,” she whispered. “Forget the sword. There is a better way. Wait till you are stronger. I will feed you rice and fish and you will become powerful as before. Then hide along the path, and when the luna comes along, leap at him and knock him down and then kick him with your zori.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Germans are big men,” Kamejiro reflected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then get some of the others to help you,” Yoriko plotted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would not hide,” Kamejiro replied. “That would offend the honor of Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then walk up to him,” Yoriko counseled, “and knock him down.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The German luna seemed rather bigger to Kamejiro than he did to Yoriko, so on his feverish bed the little laborer worked out an alternative plot that would both humiliate the luna and restore his own besmirched honor. He waited until his strength returned, bided his time while he spied on the luna, and then laid his trap. Planting himself along a road which the German had to traverse on his way to the overseers’ quarters, he trembled with excitement as he saw the towering luna approach. When the German was almost abreast of him, he called sharply, “Mr. Von Schlemm!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Startled, the luna stopped and drew his fists into a protective position. Then he saw that his accoster was the model workman Kamejiro, and he forgot that he had recently whipped the man. He dropped his guard slightly and asked, “What fo’ you call?”</p>

  <p class="normal">To his amazement, the little Japanese bent down, carefully took off his zori, stood erect like a major in a German play, and tapped the man facing him on the shoulder with the dusty Japanese shoe. At this moment Kamejiro expected to be knocked down by the luna, whereupon his friends hiding in the bushes were supposed to leap out and thrash the luna roundly.</p>

  <p class="normal">But nothing happened. The big, bewildered German stared at his strange assailant, looked down at the one bare foot, and shrugged his shoulders. “You speak, Kamejiro?” he asked, unable to comprehend what was happening.</p>

  <p class="normal">In disgust with a man so lacking in honor, Kamejiro turned his back and started hobbling with one shoe and one bare foot back to his quarters. The big luna, more perplexed than ever, watched him disappear, then shrugged his shoulders again and went along to his quarters, but as he walked he thought he heard in the sugar cane beside the road the muffled and derisive laughter of men, but when he turned suddenly to find them, he saw nothing but the waving cane.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Sakagawa Kamejiro was a hero among the Japanese of Ishii Camp. “Tell us again how you humiliated the luna!” his admirers ‘begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I went up to him just as I told my wife I would and I called, ‘Eh, you, Mr. Von Schlemm!’ Then I took off my zori and struck him on the head with it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“On the head?” asked the Japanese who had not been in the cane. “And he did nothing?”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the men who had been hiding in the cane explained: “He was astonished! He was afraid! I could see him tremble! What a sorry man he was that moment!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think we had better celebrate with some sake,” an older man suggested, proud of the manner in which Kamejiro had recovered the honor of Ishii Camp, but before the celebration could be properly launched, Ishii-san himself ran breathlessly in from Kapaa with shocking news. At first he could not speak, but then, with tears bursting from his bloodshot eyes, he blurted out: “My wife has run. away!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sumiko-san?” everyone cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She has run away to Honolulu,” the stricken man wailed. “She said she could not live in Kauai any longer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What was the matter?” one of the older men asked. “Weren’t you able to pin her down in bed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We had a good time in bed,” Ishii-san explained, “but she laughed at me for having no suit. I pleaded with her … Maybe some of you heard the fights in our house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood, a dejected man, ashamed of his fiasco and humiliated, and some of the men of Ishii Camp felt exceedingly sorry for him, for he could read and write and he had spent a good deal of money bringing a wife from Japan, and the one he finally got turned out to be the most beautiful Japanese girl in Hawaii, but he had not been able to hold her. There was a silence in the camp, and then Mrs. Sakagawa, the stocky, square-faced woman he had rejected, went up to him and said, “Forget this ill-mannered girl, Ishii-san. On the boat we grew to despise her and we knew she would never make a good wife. The blame ‘is not yours. I announce to everyone here that the blame is not Ishii-san’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The little scribe looked into the face of the rugged woman he had imported from Hiroshima, and in great dejection mumbled, “Then you forgive me, Yoriko-chan?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I forgave you long ago,” the stocky peasant girl replied, “for you enabled me to find my true husband.” She used the Japanese word Danna-san, Sir Master, and although she had never yet allowed Kamejiro to master her at anything, she sang the word in a lilting, wifelike manner and dropped her eyes, and all the men there thought: “How lucky Kamejiro was to make that swap.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In their own little house Kamejiro whispered to his wife, “Tonight I shivered to think that Sumiko might have been my wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She would have run away from you, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was lucky! I was lucky!” Kamejiro chanted. “The four hundred thousand gods of Japan were looking out for me that day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Yoriko looked down at her man and asked, “Did you truly strike Von Schlemm-san on the head with your zori?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All Japan is proud of you, danna-san.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They fell together on the bed, and Kamejiro said, “It’s very funny to me, but I knew little about girls and I thought that when a man and woman got married and slept together, babies always came along pretty quickly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sometimes they do,” Yoriko assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But not for us … it seems.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must work harder,” Yoriko explained, and they blew out the oil lamp.</p>

  <p class="normal">She also worked hard at other tasks. When the pineapples ripened, she helped harvest them at fifty-four cents a day. Later she would get a few days’ employment stripping the crowns of unnecessary leaves so that when planted they would germinate faster. For this difficult and tedious work she got seventy-five cents a thousand crowns, and by applying a dogged concentration to the job, she learned to strip upwards of four thousand a day, so that she became the marvel of the plantation, and husbands in other camps asked their wives, “Why can’t you strip crowns the way Kamejiro’s wife does?” and the wives snapped, “Because we are human beings and not machines, that’s why.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Yoriko also took over the cooking of meals for bachelors in the long house. They provided the food and she did the work. Now both she and her husband rose at three-thirty each day, he to gather wood both for his bath and for her stove, she to prepare the men’s breakfasts, and together they earned substantial wages, but their goal of $400 clear in cash continued to slip away from them. There were military events in Japan to be underwritten, and various Imperial requests forwarded by the consulate in Honolulu. There were priests to support and schoolteachers who educated the young, for who would want to take children back to Hiroshima if they knew no Japanese? And although the Sakagawas had no children of their own, they helped those who did.</p>

  <p class="normal">But most often the flight of dollars was accounted for by some personal tragedy within the camp community, as on the evening when Ishii-san burst into their home with a plea for thirty dollars. “I’ve got to go to Honolulu, right away,” he mumbled, trying to keep back his tears.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sumiko?” Mrs. Sakagawa asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Hashimoto-san, the photographer at Kapaa, was in Honolulu to buy another camera and he discovered that the man who took Sumiko away left her in the city and she . . .” He could not finish.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And she’s working in one of the brothels?” Yoriko asked coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mmmmmmm,” Ishii-san nodded, his face buried in his hands from humiliation.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That is her destiny, Ishii-san,” the Hiroshima woman assured him. “Leave her there. You can do nothing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Leave her there?” Ishii-san screamed. “She’s my wife!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Believe me, Ishii-san,” Mrs. Sakagawa asserted, “that one will be no wife, never.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you won’t let me have thirty dollars?” the little scribe pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course we will,” Kamejiro said, and although his wife protested at the waste, for she knew the trip to be useless, the passage money was delivered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Five days later little Mr. Ishii, his eyes ashamed to meet those of his friends, returned alone to Kauai. For a long time no one questioned him about his wife and he went about his work with his head down, until finally at breakfast one morning in the long room Kamejiro banged the table and asked in a loud voice, “Ishii-san, is your wife still working in the brothel?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Ishii-san replied, happy that someone had openly asked the question.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then in due time you will divorce the no-good whore?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the scribe replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re better off that way,” Kamejiro said, “but remember that you owe me thirty dollars.” The men laughed and that was the last Ishii Camp heard of beautiful Sumiko, but sometimes at the dock Kamejiro, fascinated by the peril he had so narrowly escaped, inquired of sailors from Honolulu, “Whatever happened to that girl Sumiko?” and finally he learned, “She went back to Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night when he started to tell his wife Yoriko the news, he was interrupted by her own startling intelligence: “We are going to have a baby!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro dropped his hands and all thoughts of Sumiko vanished. “A baby!” he cried with explosive joy. “We’ll name him Goro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why Goro?” Yoriko asked in her practical way. “That’s no name for a first son.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know,” Kamejiro admitted. “But years ago I decided that my first son should be Goro. The name sounds good.” And it was agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">I <span>HAVE SAID</span> that the heroic encounter between Kamejiro Sakagawa and the German luna Von Schlemm was one with historic consequences, and that is true, but they did not become apparent until forty years later. What followed immediately was that as soon as word of the affair reached Honolulu, Kamejiro’s revenge was inflated into an incipient riot, and plantation managers whispered apprehensively about “that Japanese who kicked the bejeezus out of the German luna.” Fortunately, Wild Whip was absent at the time, on vacation in Spain, but as soon as he climbed down off the H &amp; H liner he was told about it.</p>

  <p class="normal">His neck muscles tensed and blood rushed to the ugly scars across his cheek. “Who was the Jap?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Man named Kamejiro Sakagawa,” an H &amp; H official replied, and for several moments Wild Whip remained stationary on the dock, repeating the name “Kamejiro!” and looking off toward the Koolau Range. His tension increased, and on what seemed like an impulse he grabbed the reporting official by the collar.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How soon can I get a boat to Kauai?” he rasped, and as the little inter-island craft left for the Garden Island, the H &amp; H official mumbled, “God help that poor Jap when Whip gets hold of him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the ferry reached Lihue, Wild Whip in great agitation leaped onto the dock, hired a taxi and went roaring out to Hanakai, where as soon as he reached his plantation he bellowed, “Bring me that goddamned Kamejiro who thinks he can kick my lunas around.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kamejiro approached, holding his cap in his hands, as was the custom when speaking to a white man, Whip rushed up to him and yelled, “I hear you smashed up my luna?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro did not understand what was happening, and thought: “I’m going to be fired. And with a baby girl to feed, what shall I do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well?” Whip growled. “Were you the one who did it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The little Japanese fumbled with his cap and said weakly, “I not hit the luna like you say … hontoni. . . Hoxuwortu. You b’lee me. I speak truth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly Wild Whip grabbed Kamejiro by the shoulders and stuck his face close to his workman’s. “Little man,” he asked, “are you as tough as they say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is tough?” Kamejiro countered suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That day when we argued about the iron for your hot bath? Would you really have fought with me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Kamejiro understood, and since he was about to be fired anyway, he felt no caution. “Yes,” he said, jabbing Whip in the stomach with his finger. “I going to smash you here . . . with my head.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I figured that was your plan,” Whip laughed evenly. “Do you know what my plan was? When you ducked your head, I was going to . . .” With a brutal uppercut of his right fist he swung at Kamejiro’s head, stopping his knuckles an inch from the workman’s nose. “I’d have killed you!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro glared back at his boss and replied, “Maybe I too quick for you. Maybe your fist never hit.” He brought his own around with dreadful force, arresting it just short of Wild Whip’s belly.</p>

  <p class="normal">To his surprise, the boss exploded in gales of nervous laughter, embracing his gardener as if he had found a great treasure. “That settles it!” he shouted. “Kamejiro, you’re a man I can respect.” Jamming his strong hands under the little man’s armpits, he danced the astonished Japanese up and down, crying, “Start to pack, you tough little bastard, because you and I ‘have a date with a mountain.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro broke free and studied Whip suspiciously. He had seen his boss before in these wild, fantastic moods and he assumed that Whip was either drunk or morbid over some pineapple problem. “Bimeby you be mo bettah,” he assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip laughed, grabbed his workman again, and dragged him onto the lawn, where he could point to the sweet green mountains of Kauai. Gently he explained, “You and I are going over to Oahu, Kamejiro. And we’re going to blast a puka right through the mountains. We’ll get more water . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you speak, Hoxuwortu?” the little Japanese asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re going to dynamite a tunnel right through the mountains, and you’re going to do the dynamiting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro looked at his boss suspiciously. “Boom-boom?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Takusan boom-boom!” Whip replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sometime boom-boom kill,” Sakagawa countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s why I wanted a man with guts,” Whip shouted. “Good pay. One day one dollar.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mo bettah one dollar half,” Kamejiro proposed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip studied the tough little workman and laughed. “For you, Kamejiro, one dollar half.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He extended his hand to the stocky workman, but Kamejiro held back. “And one piece iron for hot bath?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All the iron you want. I hear you have a baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“One wahine,” Kamejiro confessed with shame.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bring her along . . . and your wife,” Whip cried, and the contract was confirmed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The camp to which Kamejiro moved his family was high on the rainy side of the Koolau Range on Oahu, and to operate his hot bath for the Japanese workmen Kamejiro required a waterproof shed which he and Yoriko built at night. Yoriko also managed the commissary and by dint of literally endless work the two thrifty Japanese managed to acquire a considerable nest egg, but its size was due not primarily to their hard work but rather to the fact that in these inaccessible mountains the representatives of the consulate could not reach them, and so Kamejiro passed two full years without discovering how badly his homeland needed money.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was occupied in the thrilling business of hauling great loads of dynamite deep into the tunnel, boring holes into which it was tamped, and then exploding it with dramatic effect. Technically, the job should have been simple and, if time-proved precautions were observed, free from real danger; but the Koolau Range presented perplexing features which made the job not only unpleasant but downright dangerous.</p>

  <p class="normal">Millions of years before, the rocks of which the mountains were constructed had been laid down on a flat shoreline, with alternate layers of impermeable cap rock and easily permeable conglomerate. Later, a general uptilting had occurred, standing these alternate layers upright, with their ends exposed to the ceaseless rains. For millions of years torrential cascades had seeped down through the permeable layers and deep into the recesses of the island, thus feeding the underground reservoirs which Wild Whip and his driller, Mr. Overpeck, had tapped some thirty-five years before. Now, when inquisitive Kamejiro drove his drill into the impermeable cap rock all was well; but when he got to the permeable conglomerate it was as if he had pushed his drill into solid water, and often the drill would be washed from his hands as the impounded torrents gushed out. Eight million gallons of unexpected water a day flooded the tunnel, and Kamejiro, working in the middle of it, was constantly soaked; and since the water was a uniform sixty-six degrees, he was frequently threatened with pneumonia.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wild Whip, watching him work, often thought: “He’s the kind of man you could wish was an American.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course, the phrase was meaningless, for both the Americans and the Japanese clearly understood that none of the latter could become citizens. The law forbade it, and one of the reasons why the Japanese consulate kept such close check on its nationals was that America had said plainly: “They are your people, not ours.” For example, when Japanese working on the tunnel found their food inedible they trudged in to their consulate, as was proper, and made their protest directly to the Japanese government. This accomplished nothing, for the consulate officials came from a class in Japan that exploited workers far worse than anyone in Hawaii would dare to; therefore the officials never presented protests to men like Wild Whip Hoxworth. Indeed, they marveled that he treated his Japanese as well as he did. When the tunnel workers had made their speeches, the consulate men replied abruptly: “Get back to work and don’t cause trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the food . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Back to work!” the Japanese officials roared, and the men went back. Of course, when in desperation they went to Wild Whip himself, he took one taste of the food and bellowed, “Who in hell calls this suitable for human beings?” And the diet was improved … just enough to forestall open rebellion.</p>

  <p class="normal">But there was one aspect of dynamiting in the Koolau Range that involved real danger, and that was when an apparently normal charge hung fire. For some such failures there were detectable reasons: a fuse might be faulty; or the exploding charger had not delivered a proper spark; or a connection had torn loose. It might seem that these defects should have been easy to correct, but there was always an outside chance that a true hang-fire existed: the fuse had been well lit and had started burning, but for some mysterious reason it had hesitated en route. At any moment it could resume its journey to the massive charge and any who happened to be investigating its momentary suspension would be killed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whenever a hang-fire occurred, anywhere in the tunnel, men shouted, “Eh, Kamejiro! What you think?” And he hurried up to take charge.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had a feeling about dynamite. Men claimed he could think like a stick of <span>TNT</span>, and he seemed to know when to wait and when to go forward. So far he had seen four men killed as a result of ignoring his judgment, and in the later stages of drilling his word became final. If he said, “I’ll look at the connection,” men watched admiringly as he did so; but if he said, “Too much pilikia,” everyone waited. Once he had held up operations for two hours, and in the end a thousand tons of basalt had suddenly been torn loose by a true hang-fire. Thanks to Kamejiro, no one was killed and that night one of the shaken workmen called from his hot bath: “Today, Mrs. Sakagawa, all Japan was proud of your husband!”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the last remaining fragment of basalt was pierced, blown apart by Kamejiro’s final concentration of dynamite, Hawaii began to appreciate what Wild Whip had accomplished. Twenty-seven million gallons of water a day poured down to join the artesian supplies developed earlier, and it became possible to bring into cultivation thousands of acres that, had long lain arid and beyond hope. In the traditional pattern of Hawaii, the intelligence and dedication of one man had transformed a potential good into a realized one.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the final celebration of the first great tunnel through the mountains, a speakers’ platform was erected on which the governor sat, and three judges, and military leaders, and Wild Whip Hoxworth. Florid speeches were made congratulating the wise engineers who had laid out the plans, and the brave bankers who had financed it, and the sturdy lunas who had supervised the gangs; but there were no Japanese to be seen. It was as if, when the plans were formulated and the money provided, the puka had dug itself. But late that afternoon Wild Whip, who had a feeling for these things, sought out stocky little Kamejiro Sakagawa as he was tearing down the hot bath on the rainy side, and he said to the dynamiter, “Kamejiro, what you do now?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe get one job dynamiter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re hard to get.” Whip kicked at the muddy earth and asked, “You like to work for me again, Hanakai?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe stop Honolulu, maybe mo bettah.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think so, too,” Whip agreed. “Tell you what, Kamejiro. I could never have built this tunnel without you. If I’d thought about it, I’d a had you on the platform today. But I didn’t and that’s that. Now I have a little plot of land in Honolulu, big enough for a garden. I’m going to give it to you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t want land,” the little dynamiter said. “Pretty soon go back to Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe that’s best,” Whip agreed. “I’ll do this. Instead of the land, I’ll give you two hundred dollars. And if you ever want to go back Hanakai, let me know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Kamejiro turned down land, which if he had taken it, would one day have been worth $200,000. In its place he accepted $200, but this transaction was not so silly as it sounds, for this $200 plus what he and his wife had saved gave them at last the full funds they needed for a return to Japan.</p>

  <p class="normal">They left the rainy hillside where they had worked so long and so miserably and turned joyously toward Honolulu and the offices of the Kyoto-maru, but when they got to the city they were immediately visited by officials from the consulate who were taking up a collection for the brave Imperial navy that had been fighting the Germans and a collection for the brave settlers who were going to the new colonies of Saipan and Yap. They were pounced on by Buddhist priests who were going to build a fine temple up Nuuanu. And Mr. Ishii had come over from Kauai to try his luck in Honolulu and needed a hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kamejiro!” his wife pleaded. “Don’t give that man any more money. He never pays it back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whenever I look at poor Ishii-san, I am reminded that I stole his legitimate wife, and all my happiness is founded on his misfortune,” Kamejiro said softly. “If he needs the money, he must have it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So the return to Japan was momentarily delayed, and then Yoriko announced: “We are going to have another baby,” and this time it was a boy, to be named Goro as planned. He was quickly followed by three brothers—Tadao in 1921, Minoru in 1922, and Shigeo in 1923—and the subtle bonds that tied the Sakagawas to Hawaii were more and more firmly tied, for the children, growing up in Hawaii, would speak English and laugh like Americans, and grow to prefer not rice but foods that came out of cans.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN</span> Kamejiro Sakagawa finished his work in the tunnel, and when the money he had saved dribbled through his hard hands in one way or another, he hoped, vainly as it proved, that he might find a similar job as dynamiter, but none developed. He therefore took his wife and two children to the artesian plantation west of Honolulu, the original Malama Sugar, and there he went to work, twelve hours a day for seventy-seven cents a day.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was also given an old clapboard house twenty feet wide and fourteen feet deep, from which six square feet were cut for a porch. There was a sagging lean-to shed in which Yoriko did the cooking over an iron pan. The house stood on poles one foot high, providing an under space into which children could crawl on hot days. It was a dirty, cramped, unlovely living area, but fortunately it contained at the rear just enough space for Kamejiro to erect a hot bath, so that in spite of the meager income the family was somewhat better off than the neighbors, who had to pay to use the Sakagawa bath.</p>

  <p class="normal">Furthermore, the family income was augmented by Mrs. Sakagawa, who worked in the sugar fields for sixty-one cents a day, leaving her children with neighbors. Each dusk there came a moment of pure joy when the family reconvened and the lively youngsters, their jet-black hair bobbed straight across their eyes, rushed out to meet their parents. But these moments of reunion were also apt to have overtones of confusion, for grudgingly the Sakagawas had to confess that they could not always understand what their children were saying. For example, one night when they asked in Japanese where a neighbor was, little Reiko-chan, a brilliant, limpid-eyed beauty, explained: “Him fadder pauhana konai,” and her parents had to study the sentence, for him fadder was corrupted English, pauhana was Hawaiian for the end of work, and konai was good Japanese for has not come.</p>

  <p class="normal">It therefore became apparent to Kamejiro that if he intended returning his daughter to Japan, and he did, he was going to have a hard time finding her a decent Japanese husband if she could not speak the language any better than that, so he enrolled her in the Japanese school, where a teacher from Tokyo kept strict order. Over his head loomed a great sign, with characters which Kamejiro could not read but which the teacher, a frail young man, explained: “Loyalty to the emperor.” Added the instructor: “Here we teach as in Japan. If your child does not learn, she will suffer the consequences.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will teach her about the emperor and the greatness of Japan?” Kamejiro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As if she were back in Hiroshima-ken,” the teacher promised, and from the manner in which he banged his knuckles against the heads of misbehaving boys, Kamejiro felt assured that he had put his child into good hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, Reiko-chan required no discipline, for she learned both quickly and with joy. She was then the youngest child in school but also one of the ablest, and when she ran barefooted home at night, babbling in fine Japanese, Kamejiro felt proud, for she was learning to read and he could not.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were other aspects of his life at Malama Sugar about which he was not happy, and these centered upon money. It was more expensive to live on Oahu than it had been on Kauai. Yet his wages were lower. Rice, fish, seaweed and pickles had all gone up in price, yet there were now five children) to feed, and the boys ate like pigs. Clothes too were more expensive, and although Yoriko was frugal, she did need a new visiting dress now and then. One morning, as the sun was beginning to rise, Kamejiro watched his hard-working wife setting out with her hoe and it occurred to him: “She’s been wearing the same skirt, the same dotted blouse, the same white cloth about her face and the same straw hat for five years. And they’re all in rags.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when it came time for him to buy her a new outfit, he found that he did not have the money, and he realized that even with two adults working, the Sakagawa family was existing perilously close to the starvation level. He was therefore in a receptive frame of mind when an unusual visitor arrived at Malama Sugar. It was Mr. Ishii, who was now acting as traveling agent for the Japanese Federation of Labor, and his information was that after a series of talks with the big planters like Whipple Hoxworth, his organization was going to win decent wages for the Japanese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Listen to this!” he whispered to a group of workmen with whom he met secretly. “We are asking for one dollar and twenty-five cents a day for men, ninety-five cents for wahines. Can you imagine how that will improve your living? The workday will be cut back to eight hours, and there will be bonuses in December if the year has been a good one. If you have to work on Sundays, overtime. And for the wahines, they’ll be allowed to quit work two weeks before the baby is born.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The men listened in awe as this vision of a new life dawned in the little hut, but before they had a chance to ascertain when all this was going to take place, a sentinel outside whistled, then ran up with frightening news: “Lunas! Lunas!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Four big Germans burst into the meeting place, grabbed little Mr. Ishii before he could escape, and hauled him out into the dusty yard. They manhandled him no more than necessary, being content to give him a scare with three or four good knocks, then kicked him onto the road leading back toward Honolulu. “Don’t you come onto Malama Sugar with your radical ideas,” they warned him. “Next time, plenty pilikia!”</p>

  <p class="normal">While two of the lunas made sure that the little agitator left the plantation, the other two returned to the room where the clandestine meeting had been held. “Nishimura, Sakagawa, Ito, Sakai, Suzuki,” one of the lunas recited while the other wrote. “A fine way to treat Mr. Janders and Mr. Whipple. Whose house is this? Yours, Inoguchi?” The biggest luna grabbed Inoguchi by the shirt and held him up. “I’ll remember who the traitor was,” the luna said, staring at the workmen. With a snort of disgust he threw the man back among his fellows, and the two Germans stamped out. But at the gate they stopped and said ominously, “You men go to your homes. No more meetings, understand?”</p>

  <p class="normal">As Kamejiro left he whispered to Inoguchi, “Maybe a long time before we get what Ishii-san promised?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think so, too,” Inoguchi agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">From that night on, conditions at Malama Sugar grew increasingly tense. To everyone’s surprise, little Mr. Ishii exhibited unforeseen reservoirs of heroism, for against really considerable odds, and in direct opposition to seven lunas, he managed time and again to slip back into the plantation to advise the men of how the negotiations were going. When he was caught, he was beat up, as he expected to be, and he lost one of his front teeth; but after twenty-two years of relative ineffectiveness in everything he attempted, he had at last stumbled upon an activity for which he was pre-eminently suited. He loved intrigue and rumor; he cherished the portrait of himself as a worker for the common good; so he came back again and again, until at last the lunas assembled all the field hands and said, “Anyone caught talking with the Bolshevik Ishii is going to be thrown out of his house and off the plantation. Is that clear?”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the Japanese had caught a vision of what Mr. Ishii was trying to do, and at great danger to themselves they continued to meet with him, and one day in January he told them gravely, and with the sadness that comes from seeing fine plans destroyed, “The managers will not listen to our demands. We shall have to strike.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The next day Honolulu was marked by many pamphlets bearing the unmistakable touch of Mr. Ishii, his florid manner of expression and his hope: “Good men and ladies of Hawaii. We, the laborers who grow the sugar upon which you live, address you with humility and hope. Did you know, as you drive past our waving fields of cane, that the men who grow it receive only seventy-seven cents a day? On this money we raise our children and teach them good manners and teach them to be decent citizens. But on this money we also starve.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We love Hawaii and consider it a great privilege and pride to live under the Stars and Stripes, which stands for freedom and justice. We are happy to be part of the great sugar industry and to keep the plantations running profitably.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We love work. Thirty-five years ago when we first came to Hawaii the lands where we now work were covered with ohia and guava and wild grass. Day and night have we worked, cutting those parasites and burning the grass. Our work has made the plantations, but of course it is indisputable that we could not have succeeded were it not for the investments made by wealthy capitalists and the untiring efforts of the lunas and administrators. But Hawaii must not magnify the contributions of the capitalists and forget the equal contributions of the laborers who have served faithfully with sweat on their brows.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look at the silent tombstones in every locality. They are the last emblems of Hawaii’s pioneers in labor. Why should they die in poverty while others get rich from their labors? Why should hardworking men continue to get seventy-seven cents a day? The other day a plantation manager said, ‘I think of field hands as I do jute bags. Buy them, use them, buy others.’ We think of ourselves as human beings and as members of the great human family. We want $1.25 a day for an eight-hour day. And in the interests of common humanity we deserve it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This extraordinary preamble to the workers’ demands was received differently in four different quarters. When Kamejiro Sakagawa and his co-workers heard the flowery words read to them in Japanese, with lunas at hand to take down the names of everyone attending the meeting, Kamejiro listened with amazement that his friend Mr. Ishii should have caught so exactly the emotions that motivated the workers. With tears in his eyes he said, “Inoguchi-san? Have you ever heard a better piece of paper? He says that we are part of the great human family. Did you ever think of yourself that way before?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All I think,” Inoguchi-san replied, “is that there’s going to be trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To his wife Yoriko, Kamejiro said, “When I heard Ishii-san’s statement, I was glad for every dollar I ever loaned him. It looks as if we will get all we have asked for, because that is a very powerful bit of reasoning.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His stolid wife was more of Inoguchi’s turn of mind. “We had better get ready to go hungry,” she warned. And that day the strike began.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the manifesto reached Wild Whip Hoxworth, the head of the planters’ association gagged before he got to the end of it. “Mad Russian Bolshevism!” he bellowed. “Get the planters together!” When the leaders of the sugar industry were assembled, he went over the statement line by line. ” ‘We, the laborers,’ ” he read scornfully. “As if they had convened themselves into some kind of revolutionary tribunal. ‘On this money we starve.’ What a degrading horrible play to the emotions. ‘Good men and ladies of Hawaii!’ As if by appealing to them they could by-pass those of us responsible for wages. By God, gentlemen, this document strikes at the very roots of society. It’s rampant, red, pillaging Russianism, and if there is any man in this room who breaks ranks to give those little yellow bastards an inch, I’ll personally knock him down and kick his weak-livered guts in. Is that understood?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The other planters, who were perhaps more appalled by the Bolshevik-inspired manifesto than Wild Whip, for they had studied it in a calmer light and understood its implications better than he, showed no signs of disagreeing with their leader, and when he was satisfied on that point he passed to additional matters. “Now who in hell among you made that stupid statement about workmen and jute bags?” There was silence, and after a moment he slammed the paper on the table and growled, “It’s true, and everyone here knows it’s true. But don’t say such things. Shut up. It’s nobody’s business what you and I do or think. Shut up. There’s a dreadful spirit abroad in the world today, and I blame it all on Woodrow Wilson. Appealing to the people over the heads of their government. Just like this dirty sheet. From now on, I’ll do the talking.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He summoned a secretary and dictated, while his astonished compatriots listened: “We have studied the statement of the Federation of Japanese Labor in Hawaii and are pleased to note its temperate tenor, its cautious manner of argument, and its refusal to stoop to violent or ill-founded reasoning. The men who wrote it are to be congratulated upon their restraint, which in previous similar disputes was not conspicuous.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We regret, naturally, that a group of alien workmen, not citizens of this territory, should feel Constrained to tell us how to manage the greatest industry in the islands, and it is our duty as loyal Americans to point out that in these years following a great war in which the principles of democracy were once more sustained against alien and unnatural enemies, the state of our economy, strained as it was by the war effort, simply cannot undertake any further aggravated expenses. A moment’s analysis of what is requested in these demands will satisfy any impartial . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">He went on and on in a tone of sweet reasonableness, and when the secretary had left he said to the sugar men, “That’s how we’ll handle the little bastards. This is a strike of alien Japanese Bolsheviks against the bulwarks of American freedom, and by God don’t let anybody forget . . . not for a minute. That’s the ground we’ll lick them on.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the offices of the Honolulu Mail the workers’ document had a staggering effect, for it was the first one in a long series of complaints to show any signs of mature composition. “Some fiendishly clever man. wrote this!” the editor stormed. “Hell, if you didn’t know what it was all about you might think Thomas Jefferson or Tom Paine had done it. In my opinion, this is the most dangerous document ever to have appeared in Hawaii, and it’s got to be fought on that basis.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The entire staff was summoned to analyze the inflammatory document, after which the editor retired to his sanctum. Carefully, and with much polishing, he wrote: “This morning the citizens of Hawaii were at last able to comprehend what has been going on in the Japanese-language schools, in the Buddhist temples, and in the murky confines of the Imperial consulate. The manifesto of the Bolshevik Japanese labor union at last drew the gauze from before our eyes. Citizens of Hawaii, we are faced by no less than an organized attempt to make these islands a subsidiary part of the Japanese empire. Already the first loops of the tentacles have been swept about Kauai and Maui and Oahu. There is afoot an evil design to remove from positions of leadership those noble and hard-working sons of American pioneers who made these islands great and to supplant them with crafty Orientals whose sole purpose is not the betterment of their people but the aggrandizement of a distant and alien empire.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Japanese plotters appeal to the people of Hawaii to support their cause. This newspaper appeals to the people of Hawaii to consider what it will mean to each and every one of us if the present strike should be successful. In place of far-seeing men like the Whipples, the Janderses, the Hales and the Hoxworths who have built these islands to their present position of magnificence, we would have aliens attempting to run our industries. Sugar and pineapple would languish. No cargoes would move to the mainland. Our schools would wither and our churches would be closed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must fight this strike to the end. Not a single concession must be granted. The entire citizenship of Hawaii must unite against this alien threat. For the issue at stake is brutally clear: Do we wish Hawaii to be part of America or part of Japan? There is no point in expressing the question in any other terms, and every American who has a streak of decency in him will know how to answer the terrible challenge that has been thrown down before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">This strike must fail! There must be no wavering, for any who do waver are traitors to their nation, their homes and their God.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Lest there be any misunderstanding as to the position of this newspaper at this time of grave crisis we wish to say this: If at any time in the process of this strike there is a choice between the total economic ruination of these islands and the turning of them over to the evil designs of the Japanese labor leaders, we unflinchingly declare that we will not only prefer but will encourage the former.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The fourth place in Honolulu where the manifesto occasioned an unexpectedly violent reaction was in the Japanese consulate, on Nuuanu. There the second secretary got a copy at about eight o’clock, read it, felt the blood leave his face, and rushed in to see his superior, who studied it with quivering hands. “Those fools! Those fools!” the consul cried. He had not yet seen the editorial in the Honolulu Mail, but he could visualize what was going to be said. Throwing the document down, he strode back and forth in his carpeted room, then shouted at his assistant, “Why don’t those damned Japanese laborers learn to be content with what they have? The fools! Their wages here are twice what they’d be in Japan. And they get good treatment.” He continued fuming, then assembled his entire staff.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have severe orders,” he said coldly. “This consulate will do absolutely nothing to support the strikers. If a deputation marches on this consulate, as it has always done in the past, they are to be received with no warmth whatever. It is imperative that this strike be broken quickly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Suppose the strikers seek repatriation?” an underling asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Their job is to stay here, work here, and send their money back home,” the consul snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What shall we do if they appeal against police brutality?” the same underling pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Summon me. I’ll make the usual formal protests, but we must avoid seeming to be on the side of the workmen. Remember, workmen do not govern Hawaii, and our responsibility is to people like Whipple Hoxworth who do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“One more question, sir. Suppose the strikers ask for food?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not to be granted. Gentlemen, this strike is a dangerous manifestation. If the phrases appearing in this document were to be used in Japan, those responsible would be jailed for life … or would be executed. I am appalled that decent Japanese field hands would dare to use such language. Our job is to force these men back to work. The strike must be broken, because if it isn’t, the newspapers will begin to accuse the emperor of having fomented it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The strike was broken, of course, but mainly by a series of adventitious developments, for on the day in February when the plantations evicted the Japanese laborers, telling them to live in the fields if necessary, by purest chance an influenza epidemic of the most virulent dimensions erupted, and in one crowded rural area where the strikers were living ten to a room or under trees, more than fifty of the workmen died. In all some five thousand strikers collapsed, many of them with no beds to sleep in and without hot food, and the subsequent death toll was interpreted by the superstitious as proof that the strike was against the will of God.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Sakagawa family trudged twenty-six miles into Honolulu, hoping that Mr. Ishii could find them some place to stay, but he could not, and they at last took up residence with more than four hundred others in an abandoned sake brewery, where rats crawled over the children at night. There Reiko-chan caught the flu and it seemed that she was going to die. At first her mother was tempted to rail at Kamejiro for having supported the strike and having brought such misery upon his family, but when she saw with what passionate care he tended Reiko, even though she was a girl, the stolid woman forgave her husband and said, “Danna-san, we will win the strike this time, I am sure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But next day the Board of Health met and listened to Wild Whip Hoxworth as he pointed out: “We’re engaged in war, gentlemen, and in war you use every weapon you have. Every one. I passed by the old sake brewery last night, and if s a health menace. I want the people in there evicted, and I want it closed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sir, there’s a lot of children in there with the flu,” a doctor protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s why it’s got to be closed,” Hoxworth replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But these people will have no place to go,” the doctor argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know. I want them to learn what it means to strike against the elements of law and order in a community.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But, sir, we’ve got to think . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Close that goddamned brewery!” Hoxworth bellowed, and it was closed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The temperature in Hawaii never indulges in extremes, except on the tops of the volcanic mountains, where snows persist through much of the year, but February nights can be miserably chilling, and for two influenza-ridden nights the Sakagawas slept on the ground near Iwilei. Kamejiro held the sick girl Reiko in his arms and his wife cradled Shigeo, the baby, and the nights were bad, but on the third day Mr. Ishii found them and said, “I have found a hut where an old woman died,” and they wolfed down the food that she would have eaten had she lived.</p>

  <p class="normal">For three weeks the epidemic raged and the deaths of exposed workmen reached toward the hundred mark. At the end of this time, Mr. Ishii, Kamejiro and Inoguchi-san organized a committee of sixteen who marched lawfully up Nuuanu to the Japanese consulate, seeking help in that quarter. They were met by an official in black-rimmed glasses, cutaway coat and nervous grin. Allowing Mr. Ishii to do their speaking, the men said, “We are being very poorly treated by the Americans, and we must come to the Imperial government for help.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Imperial government is protecting Japanese interests with studious care,” the official assured the deputation. “Only yesterday His Excellency protested to the Chief of Police against keeping the Japanese from holding legal meetings.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But they are throwing us out of our homes, and our men are dying in the fields,” Mr. Ishii said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">With equal calmness the spokesman explained, “His Excellency only last week looked into the law and found that the plantations have the right to expel you … if you strike.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But there is a great sickness in these islands,” Mr. Ishii protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then perhaps the strike ought to terminate,” the spokesman suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we can’t live on seventy-seven cents a day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In Japan your brothers surely live on much less,” the official assured the strikers, and the fruitless interview was concluded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Another accident which worked against the strikers was the discovery, in early May, of a schoolbook used in the Japanese schools which had a long passage explaining what was meant by the phrase used by Japan’s first emperor, “All the world under a roof of eight poles.” Quite obviously, the book explained to the children of Japan --and it was never intended for use in Hawaii but had somehow got into the islands by mistake--it was the Emperor Jimmu Tenno’s idea that all the world must some day be united into one great family paying homage to the sun goddess and obedience to the emperor, her lineal descendant. Cried the Honolulu Mail: “If anyone has wanted proof of the contentions of this newspaper that Japan intends one day to conquer the world, with Hawaii as the first step in the conquest, this evil little book proves the fact beyond contention. All the world under one roof! The local Japanese Bolsheviks have already taken the first step in that domination, and unless we remain steadfast and defeat their foul aspirations, we shall be the first foreign territory to be submerged beneath tie Japanese roof.” If sugar men were growing faint-hearted as the long strike headed for its sixth harrowing month, this timely discovery of what was being taught in Japan fortified them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, there was the disgraceful affair of dynamiting the home in which Inoguchi-san of Malama Sugar was living. No one was killed, fortunately, but when the Honolulu Mail disclosed that Inoguchi had been dynamited because he had been in secret negotiations with the sugar planters, telling them nightly what Mr. Ishii and the committee were planning next, the community had to acknowledge that the Japanese labor leaders really were a group of determined Bolsheviks. Swift police raids swept up nineteen or the leaders, including Mr. Ishii, and threw them into jail on charges of criminal conspiracy. Wild Whip Hoxworth visited the judges involved and pointed out that the charges might better be criminal syndicalism, and they thanked him for his interest in the case.</p>

  <p class="normal">But now the question arose as to who had taught the committee how to handle dynamite, and a reporter remembered that Kamejiro Sakagawa, who had not yet been arrested, had learned the trade while working on the tunnel. He was known to be a friend of Mr. Ishii’s, and so the police arrested him. He was thrown into jail, even though he had had nothing to do with the dynamiting, whereupon his wife Yoriko proved to the police that he had been at home caring for his sick children. The sugar committee, who were advising the district attorney as to how he should handle the case, refused to accept this alibi, pointing out: “A clever man like Sakagawa didn’t have to be actually at the scene of the crime. He could well have prepared the sticks in advance and shown his fellow conspirators how to explode them. He is obviously guilty.” And he was kept in jail.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the strike ended, with the workmen having gained little, and sugar was once more produced by some of the cheapest labor in America. H &amp; H made millions carrying fresh cargoes to California, and J &amp; W made more millions managing the plantations in the good old way. The conspirators were brought to trial and Mr. Ishii was sentenced to ten years in jail. He sagged when the words were thrown at him, falling backwards as if they had actually struck him, and from that day on he was never much of a man again. He grew to mumble and imagine things, and no one took much account of him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Surprisingly, Kamejiro, the dynamiter by trade, was not convicted, for one day before the trial began he had a visitor in his cell. It was Wild Whip Hoxworth, lean and tall and handsome, flushed with victory. Eh you, Kamejiro. Boys say you plant dynamite. That true?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Mr. Hoxuwortu. No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Me, I think no too.” And Wild Whip told the district attorney, “You better drop charges against Sakagawa. He wasn’t involved.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you know?” the young lawyer asked, nervous with excitement over the trial that was going to make his reputation.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because he told me so,” Whip explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you’re going to take his word?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s the most honest man I know. Besides, his alibi is a good one.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I think we’ve got to convict the actual dynamiter, whether his alibi is good or not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Turn him loose!” Whip thundered. He was sixty-six years old and tired of arguing with fools.</p>

  <p class="normal">So on the morning that the trial convened, Kamejiro was quietly set free. Of course, he was never again able to get a job at Malama Sugar, for the great plantations prudently maintained blacklists in order to keep out troublemakers, and he had now proved himself one who fought with lunas and supported Bolsheviks like Ishii. He found a small, rat-infested shack in the Kakaako area of Honolulu, from which he did odd jobs, principally the cleaning out of privies after midnight. Children whose fathers had better jobs called him “King of the Night Brigade,” and indeed the name King was fitting, for whatever he was required to do, he did with the most earnest skill, so that in spite of the fact that he was surreptitiously known as Sakagawa the Dynamiter, the man who had tried to kill Inoguchi, people nevertheless continued to seek him out when their privies needed unloading, for he merited the title, “King of the Night Brigade.”</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1926 the disreputable old English botanist Dr. Schilling developed another striking idea about the growing of pineapple. Recovering from a four-month drunk, he turned fresh, if bloodshot, eyes upon the great fields of Kauai, and as he studied the swarms of Japanese women hoeing out the weeds from the red soil, he thought: “Why don’t we spread paper over the whole damned field, punch holes in it where we plant the baby pineapple, and make it impossible for weeds to grow?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He got some asphalt paper, rolled it across a trial field, and planted a crop of pineapple in the small holes he had punched in the black covering. To his surprise, the simple trick not only killed off all the weeds, saving hundreds of dollars in labor charges, but also provided two unforeseen advantages which proved to be more profitable than even the extermination of weeds: the paper trapped moisture and held it about the roots of the plants, and on sunny days it accumulated heat which was later dissipated exactly when the plants required it.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Wild Whip saw the results of the experiment he gave an instant and dramatic order: “Hereafter all pineapple on our plantations will be grown under paper,” and he worked diligently with Dr. Schilling and the California wood-pulp people in devising a special paper that resisted water for the first seven months of its life, then slowly disintegrated so that by the tenth month the field was clean. When the project was completed, Wild Whip reminded the pineapple men: “You can always find somebody from Yale who can accomplish anything you want. Treat them well, pay them a little, and call, them Doctor. That’s all they expect. But somebody with brains has got to set the problem for them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, in 1927, this nonpareil of planters died at the brawling, bruising age of seventy. He died, as he had often predicted, of no ordinary disease but from an aggravated cancer of the prostate occasioned, the islands felt sure, by his numerous cases of gonorrhea and syphilis, plus cirrhosis of tie liver brought on by endless overdoses of alcohol, all aggravated by the fact that the small airplane in which he was flying back from Hanakai Plantation to Honolulu flew into the mountain that he had pierced with his great tunnel. He had lain exposed in cold rain for nearly twenty-four hours, but even under those conditions the vital old man fought a fairly even contest with death for a period of three weeks, during which he summoned to his hospital bed the leading members of H &amp; H and J &amp; W, including all who might logically aspire to his chairmanship. Raising himself in pain to a sitting position, which appalled the nurses, he grunted, “We’re entering a difficult period, and our job is to make half a dozen right decisions.” He spoke as if he were to be with the managers for many years to come, and possibly forever. “I’m sure our present prosperity can’t continue forever, and when there’s a leveling off, sugar and pineapple will be hard hit. Thank God, it doesn’t seem likely the Democrats will ever return to Washington, so we don’t have to worry about radical communism. But we do have to worry about keeping our share of the market.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ve got to have somebody heading up our enterprises who is clever enough to anticipate the future and bold enough to fight what’s wrong. I’ve given a good deal of thought as to who that should be, and I’ve come up with only one solid conclusion. Don’t ever, under any conceivable circumstances, allow either of my sons, Jesus Duarte or John, to meddle in this business. Pay them well, pay them regularly, and keep them to hell out of Hawaii. If my other son, Janders, had lived . . . well, that might have been a different story.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Naturally I’ve thought a great deal about Mark Whipple. He has his father’s brains and would have been my first choice, except that being a West Point man, he thinks he ought to stay with the army, and maybe he’s right. But if he ever decides to resign his commission, get him back into the company quick.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve also given a good deal of consideration to Hewie Janders,” and here the big, rugged, florid man who had starred as guard at Yale blushed, but Wild Whip continued, “and I fear that Hewie’s attributes do not include intellectual force, which is what we need now.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve passed over, as you can see, all the older fellows, because we need somebody who’s going to give our firms a long, continued and strong leadership. So I’ve chosen as my executor, and the man to vote my shares as long as he remains intellectually and morally capable, this fellow.” And he reached out and took the hand of Hoxworth Hale, then twenty-nine years old and aching for authority. The other directors could not protest the decision, nor had they any cause to do so, for Hale was obviously the man to take over at this juncture.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Three rules, Hoxworth, and the rest of you listen. Don’t ever sell sugar short. I went into pineapple, that’s true, but only when I had a solid, secure base in sugar. You do the same. Protect sugar by research, protect your quotas by legislation, protect the plantations, protect your labor supply. Stay with sugar. It’s better than money, more dependable than blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Second, never allow labor to rear its head an inch. Study what’s happened on the mainland. If a labor leader tries to get onto these islands, throw him back into the ocean and tell him to swim, but don’t even show him which way California is. Be careful of the Japanese. They’re making sounds like they wanted a union. Trust only the Filipinos, because nobody else can be trusted. But if the bole-boys attempt any foolishness, bat them down.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Third, you’ve got to keep mainland firms from forcing their way into our economy. Don’t let the chain stores in. Don’t let outfits like Gregory’s and California Fruit onto these shores. We have a good system here, one that we’ve worked damned hard to perfect, and we don’t want a lot of radical new ideas polluting it. If such gangsters try to invade, sell them no land, refuse to handle their shipping, tie them up on credit, strangle the bastards.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He had spoken rather forcefully and now fell back on his pillow, aching in the cancered prostate, in his failing kidneys and in each of his four broken bones. The nurses dragooned a passing doctor, who cried, “Good God, gentlemen, you’re most inconsiderate! Now you get out of here!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whip fell into a little sleep, and when in the late afternoon he woke, it was with considerable elation of spirit, for he was reviewing in imagination a series of pictures he had first invented with his wonderful old grandmother, Noelani, the Alii Nui from Lahaina. On her last trip to the Orient, Noelani had acquired a set of Japanese color prints snowing what were called the eight loveliest scenes on earth. It contained a mountain in snow, boats returning to shore, wild geese descending, and sunset. “It is things like these,” gracious old Noelani had told her grandchildren, “that are the real beauty of life.” They had played a game: “Let’s decide what the eight loveliest scenes of Hawaii are.” And now Wild Whip, himself older than Noelani when she had umpired the contest, reviewed the permanent grandeurs of his islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">For the mountain in the snow, they had chosen the great volcanoes of the big island, mysteriously clothed in white, yet standing within the tropics. Geologists considered them the highest single mountains in the world—19,000 feet below the ocean, almost 14,000 above. Nowhere in the world could boats returning to shore be lovelier than at Lahaina, where the roads were caught between islands. The wild geese descending were, of course, the single most glorious sight in Hawaii: the myriad waterfalls at the leper settlement of Kalawao. “How beautiful they were,” Whip thought. “How beautiful.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The evening glow, which the men who designated the eight supreme views liked especially, could be seen nowhere with finer effect than at the deep red canyon of Kauai, an incredible gash through fifty million years of scintillating rock; at dusk it seemed filled with demonic force. And as for night rain, much loved by the Japanese, where could it be seen to more poetic effect than on the gloomy lava beds of the big island, those convoluted and tormented beds which had overrun the first settlers from Bora Bora?</p>

  <p class="normal">The next two scenes were from Oahu, queen of the islands. Once Wild Whip had seen an autumn moon, gray and silver in radiance, shining on the plains that lay at the foot of the Pali, and he had been captivated by the subtle interplay of dark forms and moonlit shadows. The evening bell, which Chinese loved for its memories of home, Whip and his grandmother had assigned to Honolulu, for it was indeed memorable to sit on some broad lanai on a Honolulu hillside, listening to the evening bells of the churches and watching the lights of the city come on.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an eighth view, the sunset sky, the end of the day, the last glimpse of earth, and Whip could never recall where Noelani had placed this concluding view; but for himself, as he thought of his islands now, he could place it only at Hanakai. He saw the Norfolk pines and the royal palms, the trees and flowers he had brought in from all over the world. He saw the wild cliffs and the storms of winter leaping upon them, but most of all he saw beyond the grassy polo field the light green of sugar and higher up the dark blue-green of pineapple. How beautiful Hawaii was, how cherished by the ancient deities.</p>

  <p class="normal">He died a Hawaiian, leaving his wild spirit to haunt the places he had loved. He was attended only by a pretty little Filipino girl he had picked up on Kauai. In his last minutes he tried to dictate a note to his seductive, brown-skinned playmate, but to his distress found she could not write, so he bellowed for a nurse, for he wanted to warn his successor: “Hoxworth, best way to keep labor controlled is to keep hand in legislature at all times.” But when the nurse arrived to take this message, Wild Whip was dead, the builder of the islands who had been unable to build his own life, and the authorities spirited his little Filipino girl back to Kauai. The glowing sums of money old Whip had promised her she never got.</p>

  <p class="normal">At twenty-nine Hoxworth Hale assumed control of the vast holdings, and when he first took the chair that Wild Whip had occupied for fifteen years, he realized that he must seem like a boy presuming to do a man’s work, but at least he was dressed correctly for his new role: a dark-blue four-button suit with tight vest, an Egyptian-cotton shirt with detachable stiff collar and a heavy blue and red tie. His cuff links were of gold and pearl, and his hair was parted severely on the right-hand side. He was clean-shaven and steady of mind, and he was determined to send forward the fortunes of the family.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was not unaccustomed to command, for quick upon the heels of his impulsive enlistment in the American Expeditionary Force in 1917, he had become a sergeant, and in France had won a battlefield commission, demobilizing as a captain. His troops had great regard for him; he tried to be a brave, self-contained young leader, willing to assault any objective. His men also found him fun to be with, for he posed as having the insouciance that all young men in uniform like to think they have, and his company was one of the best.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the war he completed his education at Yale, a quiet young man of twenty-two whose early radicalism had been abandoned somewhere in France, and he never once wandered back to see the notorious Jarves paintings. When he graduated he was already a conservative businessman, eager to make his contribution to Hoxworth &amp; Hale, but in California on his way back to Hawaii he met a lovely girl whose father was a rancher with large land holdings. For a while it looked as if they were going to marry, but one night she spoke disparagingly of Honolulu and suggested that Hoxworth remain in California: “Hoxy! You could have your father assign you to the San Francisco office!”</p>

  <p class="normal">His reply had been both cold and distant: “We send only nephews who aren’t too bright to California.” The courtship ended and after that no one ever again called him Hoxy.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he had been at work for some time in the head office in Honolulu he married his third cousin, Malama Janders, who was Hewie Janders’ sister, and within a year he had a son Bromley, whom he prudently registered for both Punahou and Yale. It was true that whenever business took him to San Francisco, he experienced a sense of deep excitement when he first saw the California coastline, and he often wondered what had become of the pretty rancher’s daughter; but that was about as errant a thought as he ever had.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, in 1927, Hoxworth Hale was these things, and in each he was an almost perfect exemplification of the archetype: he was a Hale, a Punahou graduate, a Yale man, the head of a great island firm, and a man married to his cousin. Therefore, when he spoke at his first meeting of the H &amp; H board, his colleagues listened: “There is an unfortunate spirit of agitation in the world today, and I believe our first concern must be the protection of our position by exercising some kind of logical control over the legislature.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He outlined a sensible plan whereby his impressive cousin, big Hewie Janders, got himself elected president of the senate, while half a dozen assorted lawyers, treasurers and accountants who worked for the big firms ran for lesser seats. For speaker of the house Hoxworth shrewdly selected the jovial, relaxed Chinese politician Kangaroo Kee, to whom he offered several lucrative contracts; and so carefully did the new young leader plan that before long Hawaii passed into that secure and reasonable period when most of its legislation was decided upon first at quiet meetings held in the board room of H &amp; H, whence it was sent to trusted representatives who could be depended upon to enact laws pretty much as proposed by Hoxworth Hale and his close associates.</p>

  <p class="normal">The board room of H &amp; H was on the second floor of a large, fortlike building that stood at the comer of Fort and Merchant, and from this combination of facts the powerful clique that ran Hawaii came to be known simply as The Fort. It included, of course, H &amp; H and also J &amp; W. The Hewletts were members, as were some of the lesser planters from the big island. Banks, railways, trust companies and large estate owners were represented, but exactly what The Fort consisted of no man could properly say; it was simply the group who by common consent were entitled to meet on the second floor of H &amp; H, a close-knit, cohesive body of men who were determined to give Hawaii a responsible form of government.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Fort rarely abused its power. If some crackpot legislator not subservient to it wanted to curry favor with his constituents shouting, “I promised you I’d get a playground for Kakaako, and I’ll get you a playground for Kakaako,” they let him yell, and at one of their meetings Hoxworth Hale would ask, “Is there any reason why there shouldn’t be a playground at Kakaako?” and if such a project did not imperil any fundamental interest of The Fort—and if its cost could be passed on to the general public without raising real estate taxes—the playground was allowed to go through. But if the same legislator subsequently shouted, “Last year plantation trains running without lights killed four people, so I insist upon lights where plantation trains cross public roads,” then The Fort moved quietly but massively into action. “We’ve looked into costs of such lights,” Hoxworth Hale would tell his directors, “and they would cut our sugar profits to the bone.” Somehow such bills were iceboxed in committee, and no amount of yelling by infuriated legislators could get them unfrozen.</p>

  <p class="normal">Any major bill affecting either sugar, pineapple or land had to be actually drafted by The Fort itself; such bills were too important to be left to the whims of a legislature. But it was to Hoxworth Kale’s credit that he did not allow grossly abusive bills to be proposed: “My interpretation of democracy is that business must never intrude into ordinary legislative processes, except where matters of vital importance are at stake and then never for selfish motives.” At some sessions of the legislature forty-nine out of fifty bills were not interfered with in any way; but this was partly because the legislators had learned to ask, before proposing a bill, “Will The Fort go for this?” It was common prudence not to propose something that The Fort would automatically have to fight.</p>

  <p class="normal">A fine example of Hoxworth Hale’s statesmanship came one January when his wife, a Janders girl with a warm concern for human rights, said at breakfast, “Hoxworth, have you seen the casualty lists that resulted from the New Year’s fireworks?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were they bad, Malama?” he asked. One of the annual highlights in Hawaii was the Chinese New Year, when the Chinese practically blew the city apart with detonations of the most spectacular sort.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This year one boy was killed and fourteen were seriously maimed,” Malama reported. Really, these fireworks must be outlawed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth, who agreed that the practice of blowing off arms and legs was ridiculous, told his wife, “If you can outlaw them by legal means, go ahead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Consequently, Mrs. Hale enlisted a committee of fifty public-spirited ladies—all of them haole, unfortunately—who descended upon the legislature with a bill to halt the crippling of children. The first legislators approached thought: “Mrs. Hale! Probably got The Fort behind her. Better pass this bill.” So the famous anti-fireworks bill was introduced.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then all hell broke loose! By comparison, the New Year’s pyrotechnic display was a subdued affair, for Chinese legislators shouted on the floor, “This is discrimination! We have always blown up fireworks on New Year’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To everyone’s surprise, the Chinese quickly gained support from the Hawaiians. “We love fireworks!” they protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">A bombastic Portuguese legislator gave an impassioned plea for the right of little people to have their fun just one night a year, and a huge lobby of storekeepers, who made more than seventy per cent profit selling firecrackers, began to disrupt all customary legislative procedures.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point jovial Kangaroo Kee, speaker of the house and supposed to be a creature of The Fort, displayed leadership of an unexpected sort. Handing the gavel over to a friend, he descended to the floor of the house and delivered one of the most impassioned bits of oratory heard in Hawaii for many years. He shouted: “This evil bill is an attempt to deprive the Chinese of Hawaii of an inalienable right! It is religious persecution of the most abominable sort! Do the haole women who brought in this bill need fireworks for their religious ceremonies? No! But do Chinese need them for their ceremonies?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He paused, and from the entire Chinese-Portuguese-Hawaiian contingent of the house went up a great, throbbing cry in defense of religious freedom. So Kangaroo Kee continued: “I warn the people who have dared to bring this bill onto the floor of this house that if it is voted into law, I will instantly resign! I can stand political domination. I can stand economic retaliation. But I cannot stand religious persecution!” Men wept and the hall echoed with cheers.</p>

  <p class="normal">That afternoon Hoxworth Hale summoned The Fort and asked glumly, “What in hell has happened around here? Why do we suddenly wind up as religious persecutors?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your wife started it all by wanting to save children from fireworks,” big Hewie Janders reminded him. “And my wife, damn her bleeding heart, gave your wife support.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All I know,” Hoxworth growled, “is that the Chinese are threatening to start a new political party. The Hawaiians are charging religious persecution. The Portuguese have enlisted both of them behind that grade-crossing bill. And Kangaroo Kee submitted his resignation this morning. Says he’ll suffer no more dictation from tyrants. Gentlemen, we better do something.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hewie Janders suggested: “Could you make a formal statement? In defense of religious freedom and firecrackers?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Get a secretary,” Hoxworth snapped, and when the young man arrived, the head of The Fort dictated his memorable announcement beginning: “The Islands of Hawaii have always known religious freedom, and among those who have defended this basic concern of all men none have excelled the Chinese. To think that unfeeling persons should have seen fit to trample upon one of the most cherished rituals of Chinese religion, namely, the explosion of fireworks at festive seasons, is repugnant.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Hewie Janders pointed out: “But it was your wife and mine who did it, Hoxworth! If you release such a statement, they’re going to boil.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To this Hale replied, “When the structure of society is endangered, I don’t care whose feelings get hurt.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The upshot of his retreat was that Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Janders considered their husbands contemptible cowards, and said so; Kangaroo Kee, breaking down into a copious flow of tears, announced to the house that he had reconsidered his resignation because the leaders of Hawaii had magnanimously reaffirmed their belief in religious freedom; the dangerous Chinese-Hawaiian-Portuguese coalition was broken up; and merchants sold more fireworks than ever before. On the next Chinese New Year two children were blinded, a girl had three fingers blown off and there were sixteen cases of disfiguring burns; but the islands were happy. The Honolulu Mail, summarizing the wild night, called it a splendid manifestation of island charm. But Hoxworth Hale, whose wife pointed out that the blindings and maimings were exactly what her bill had been intended to prevent, remarked glumly to The Fort: “We must never again outrage the firecracker vote.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was under Hale’s direction that The Fort insinuated its men onto the public boards that controlled things like the university and the parks, and once when an outside writer took pains to cross-reference the 181 most influential board members in Hawaii, he found that only thirty-one men in all were involved, and that of them twenty-eight were Hales, Whipples, Hoxworths, Hewletts and Janderses … or their sons-in-law. “A very public-spirited group of people,” the writer concluded, “but it is often difficult to tell one board from the other or any from the board of H &amp; H.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Honolulu Mail was owned by The Fort, but its function in the community was never blatantly abused. It was a good paper, Republican of course, and it frequently supported positions which The Fort could not have approved but which the general public did; but when an issue involved land, sugar or labor, the Mail wrote forceful editorials explaining how the public good was involved and how government ought to respond. Once when a Mail reporter was sent to fifteen different sugar-growing areas to write a series of articles proving how much better off the people of Hawaii were than laborers in Jamaica, Fiji and Queensland, his returning letters were first studied in The Fort, “to be sure he maintains the proper historical perspective.” The Mail was scrupulously fair in reporting activities of the underground Democratic Party, but the articles were written as if a benevolent old man was chuckling over the actions of imbecile and delinquent children.</p>

  <p class="normal">The endless chain of appointed office holders sent out from Washington—too often incompetent and gregarious politicians—was quickly absorbed into The Fort’s genial social life: hunting trips to the big island, boating parties, picnics by the sea. Sometimes a newcomer could sit on the bench for six months without ever meeting a Chinese other than a defendant in a court case or a Japanese who was not dressed in white and serving sandwiches. Such officials could be forgiven if they came to think of Hawaii as The Fort and vice versa and to hand down their decisions accordingly.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Hoxworth Hale’s greatest contribution lay in a general principle which he propounded early in his regime, and it is to his credit that he perceived this problem long before any of his contemporaries, and his adroit handling of it earned The Fort millions upon millions of dollars. He announced his policy flatly: “No military man stationed in Hawaii above the rank of captain in the army or lieutenant in the navy is to leave these islands without having been entertained by at least three families in this room.” Then he added, “And if you can include the lower ranks, so much the better!” As a result of this rule, the constant flow of military people who passed through Hawaii came to think of big Hewlett Janders and gracious Hoxworth Hale as the two commanders of the islands, men who could be trusted, men who were sound; and in the years that were about to explode, making Hawaii a bastion of the Pacific, it was very difficult for Washington to send any senior admiral or general to Honolulu who did not already know The Fort intimately. Therefore, when a contract was to be let, bids weren’t really necessary: “Hewlett Janders, the fellow I went hunting with ten years ago, he can build it for us.” More important, when the procurement and engineering offices in Washington began to assume major importance hi America’s rush program of military expansion, the rising young men who crowded those offices almost had to be the ones that Hoxworth Hale and Hewie Janders had entertained so lavishly in the previous decade.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nothing Hoxworth accomplished was more important than this establishment of a personal pipeline direct to the sources of power in Washington. Again, he never abused his prerogatives. He never called generals on the phone, shouting, as did some, “Goddam it, Shelly, they’re talking about eminent domain on three thousand acres of my choicest sugar fields.” Usually this made Washington determined to go ahead with condemnation proceedings. Hoxworth Hale acted differently: “This you, Shelly? How’s Bernice? We’re fine out here. Say, Shelly, what I called about was the proposed air strip out Waipahu way. That’s a good site, Shelly, but have your men studied what the landing pattern would be with those tall mountains at the end . . . Yes, Shelly, the ones we went hunting on that weekend . . . Yes, I just want to be sure your men have thought about that, because there’s another strip of land a little farther makai . . . Yes, that means toward the sea in Hawaiian, and I was wondering . . . Yes, it’s our land, too, so there’s no advantage to me one way or the other … Be sure to give Bernice our best.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hawaii in these years of benevolent domination by The Fort was one of the finest areas of the world. The sun shone, the trade winds blew, and when tourists arrived on the luxury H &amp; H liners the police band played hulas and girls in grass skirts danced. Labor relations were reasonably good, and any luna who dared strike a worker would have been instantly whisked out of the islands. The legislature was honest, the judges sent out from the mainland handed down strict but impartial decisions, except in certain unimportant cases involving land, and the economy flourished. It is true that mainland&#160; firms like&#160; Gregory’s&#160; and&#160; California&#160; Fruit protested:&#160;&#160; “My God, the place is a feudal barony! We tried to buy land for a store and they said, ‘You can’t buy any land in&#160; Hawaii. We don’t want your kind of store in the islands.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was also true that Chinese or Japanese who wanted to leave the islands to travel on the mainland had to get written permission to do so, and if The Fort felt that a given Oriental was not the kind of man who should represent the islands in America, because he tended toward communist ideas, speaking of labor unions and such, the authorities would not let him leave, and there was nothing he could do about it. Hewlett Janders in particular objected to the large number of young Chinese and Japanese who wanted to go to the mainland to become doctors and lawyers, and he personally saw to it that a good many of them did not get away, for, as he pointed out: “We’ve got fine doctors right here that we can trust, and if we keep on allowing Orientals to become lawyers, we merely create problems for ourselves. Educating such people above their station has got to stop.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Once in 1934, after Hoxworth and his team had performed miracles in protecting Hawaii from the fury of the depression—it fell less heavily on the islands than anywhere else on earth—he was embittered when a group of Japanese workers connived to have a labor man from Washington visit the islands, and Hale refused to see the visitor. “You’d think they’d have respect for what I’ve done keeping Hawaii safe from the depression. Every Japanese who got his regular pay cheek, got it thanks to me, and now they want me to talk with labor-union men!”</p>

  <p class="normal">He refused three times to permit an interview, but one day the man from Washington caught him on the sidewalk and said hurriedly, “Mr. Hale, I respect your position, but I’ve got to tell you that under the new laws you are required to let labor-union organizers talk to your men on the plantations.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s that?” Hoxworth asked in astonishment. “Did you say . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I said,” the visitor, an unpleasant foreign type, repeated slowly, “that under the law you are required to permit labor-union organizers access to your men on the plantations.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought that’s what you said,” Hale replied. “Good heavens, man!” Then, taking refuge in a phrase he had often heard Wild Whip declaim, he said, “If I saw a rattlesnake crawling onto one of my plantations and I shot him, I’d be a hero. Yet you want me voluntarily to open my lands to labor organizers. Truly, you must be out of your mind.” He turned abruptly and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Hale!” the labor man called, catching up with him and grabbing his coat.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you ever touch me!” Hale stormed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I apologize,” the man said contritely. “I just wanted to warn you that Hawaii’s no different from the rest of America.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Apparently you don’t know Hawaii,” Hale said, and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">In his cold, efficient governance of The Fort he manifested only two peculiarities which could be construed as weaknesses. Whenever he had a major decision to make he spent some time alone in his office, pushing back and forth across his polished desk a reddish rock about the size of a large fist, and in the contemplation of its mysterious form he found intellectual reassurance. “The rock came from his great-great-grandmother on Maui,” his secretary explained. “It’s sort of a good-luck omen,” she said, but what the good luck derived from she did not know and Hale never told her. Also, whenever The Fort started a new building Hale insisted that local kahunas be brought in to orient it. Once a mainland architect asked, “What’s a man with a Yale degree doing with kahunas?” and Hale replied, “You’d be surprised. In our courts it’s illegal to force a Hawaiian to testify if a known kahuna is watching in the courtroom.” The architect asked, “You certainly don’t believe such nonsense, do you?” and Hale replied evasively, “Well, if I were the judge, I would certainly insist that any known kahunas be barred from my courtroom. Their power is peculiar.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One unspoken rule regarding The Fort was observed by all: The Fort did not exist; it was a phrase never mentioned in public; Hale himself never spoke it; and it was banned from both newspaper and radio. The building in which the men met remained as it was during Wild Whip’s tenancy: a rugged red-stone commercial headquarters built like a fort and bearing a simple brass plate that read: Hoxworth &amp; Hale, Shipmasters and Factors.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>BACK</span> IN <span>THE</span> 1880’s, when the Chinese vegetable peddler Nyuk Tsin decided to educate her five sons and to send one of them all the way to Michigan for a law degree, Honolulu had been amazed at her tenacity and instructed by the manner in which she forced four of her sons to support the fifth on the mainland. But what Hawaii was now about to witness in the case of Japanese families and their dedication to learning made anything that the Chinese had accomplished look both dilatory and lacking in conviction. Specifically, the penniless night-soil collector Kamejiro Sakagawa was determined that each of his five children must have nothing less than a full education: twelve years of public school, four years at the local university, followed by three at graduate school on the mainland. In any other nation in the world, such an ambition would have been insane; it was to the glory of America, and especially that part known as Hawaii, that such a dream on the part of a privy-cleaner was entirely practical, if only the family had the courage to pursue it.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the Kakaako home each morning the five Sakagawa children set forth to school. They were clean. Their black hair was bobbed straight across their eyes and their teeth had no cavities. They walked with an eager bounce, their bright scrubbed faces shining in sunlight, for to them school was the world’s great adventure. Their education did not come easily, for it was conducted in a foreign language: English. At home their mother spoke almost none and their father knew only pidgin.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in spite of language difficulties, the five Sakagawas performed brilliantly and even teachers who might have begun with an animus against Japanese grew to love these particular children. Reiko-chan set the pattern for her brothers. In her first six grades she usually led her class, and when teachers had to leave the room to see the principal, they felt no compunction about turning their classes over to this adorable little girl with the delicately slanted eyes and the flawless skin. Reiko-chan was destined to be a teacher’s pet, and early in life she decided that when she graduated from the university, she would be a teacher too.</p>

  <p class="normal">The boys were a more rowdy lot, and no teacher in her right mind would have turned her class over to them. They specialized in the rougher games, for in accordance with the ancient rule that all who came to Hawaii were modified, the four Sakagawa boys were obviously going to be taller than their father, with better teeth, wider shoulders and straighter legs. It was noticeable that they threw like Americans and could knock bottles off fences with surprising accuracy, but their mastery of English fell markedly below their sister’s, a fact of which they were proud, for in the Honolulu public schools anyone who spoke too well was censured and even tormented by his classmates. To be accepted, one had to speak pidgin like a moron, and above everything else, the Sakagawa boys wanted to be accepted.</p>

  <p class="normal">The success of this family in the American school was the more noteworthy because when classes were over, and when haole children ran home to play, the five Sakagawas lined up and marched over to the Shinto temple, where the man who was a priest on Sundays appeared in a schoolteacher’s black kimono to conduct a Japanese school. He was a severe man, much given to beating children, and since he was proud of the fact that he spoke no corrupting English and had only recently come from Tokyo, he tyrannized the children growing up in an alien land. “How can you ever become decent, self-respecting Japanese,” he stormed, “if you do not learn to sit properly upon your ankles. Sakagawa Goro!” and the heavy rod fell harshly across the boy’s back. “Do not fidget! Will you feel no shame when you return home and visit friends and fidget?” Bang, went the rod. Bang and bang again.</p>

  <p class="normal">The priest was contemptuous of everything American and impressed upon his charges that they were in this alien land for only a few years until they took up their proper life, and when he described Japan, his eyes grew misty and a poetry came into his voice. “A land created by the immortal gods themselves!” he assured them. “In Japan there is no rowdyism like here. In Japan children are respectful to their parents. In Japan every man knows his place and all do reverence to the emperor. No man can predict what impossible things Japan will some day accomplish.” He taught from the same books that were used in Tokyo, using the same inflections and the same stern discipline. For three hours each day, when other children were rollicking in the sun, the Sakagawas sat painfully on their ankles before the priest and received what he called their true education.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was much agitation against the Japanese-language schools, as they were called, and there was no doubt that the priests taught an un-American, Shintoistic, nationalistic body of material, but in those years not a single child who attended the schools got into trouble with the police. Among the Japanese there was no delinquency. Parents were obeyed and teachers were respected. In the Japanese schools a severe rectitude was taught and enforced, and much of the civic responsibility that marked the adult Japanese community derived from these austere late-afternoon sessions; and it was a strange thing, but not a single child in later years ever remembered much of the jingoistic nonsense taught by the priests; few ever wanted to go back to Japan; but all learned respect for an established order of life. It was as if the great freedoms enjoyed in the American school in the first part of the day insulated the child against the nationalistic farrago of the afternoon, so that most Japanese children, like the Sakagawas, assimilated the best from both schools and were not marred by the worst of either.</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, their true education in these years took place at home. In their tiny Kakaako shack, which would have been cramped even for a family of three, their mother enforced the rigid rules of cleanliness that she had learned as a child. Nothing was left on the floor. No dish went unwashed. Chopsticks were handled so that no food dropped. Clothes were put away neatly, and the child who did not bathe completely at least once each day was a hopeless barbarian, no better than a Chinese. Their father’s influence was more subtly felt. He saw the world as divided sharply into the good and the bad and he never hesitated long in defining where any given action fell. It was good to honor one’s country, it was good to die heroically, it was good to attend to what one’s superiors said, it was good to have education. He lived a life of the most fierce propriety in which stealing was bad, and gambling, and speaking back, and tearing one’s clothes. He was a harsh disciplinarian, but he rarely struck his children, relying instead upon the force of his character. He loved his children as if they were mysterious angels that had been allowed to live with him for a little while, and if the mean little shack was sometimes barren of food, it was never lacking in love.</p>

  <p class="normal">The children engaged in nonsensical jokes which their parents could not understand. Reiko-chan had a series of remarks which her brothers greeted with shouts no matter how often she recited them: “What did the hat say to the hatrack? You stay here and I’ll go on a head.” Six times a week the boys could scream with delight over that one. “What did the carpet say to the floor? Don’t make a move, I got you covered!” And “What did the big toe say to the little toe? Don’t look back, but we’re being followed by a heel.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The boys had rougher games, including one in which Goro would grab a brother’s ear and ask sweetly, “Do you want your ear any longer?” If the brother said no, Goro would pretend to twist it off. If the answer was yes, Goro would jerk vigorously on the ear and shout, “Then I’ll make it longer!” This usually led to a fight, which was what Goro had intended.</p>

  <p class="normal">But on two basic principles the Sakagawa children would permit no joking. No one was allowed to call them Japs. This was a word so offensive to the Japanese that it simply could not be tolerated, for throughout America it was being used in headlines and cartoons to depict sneaking, evil little men with buckteeth. No haole could appreciate the fervor with which Japanese combated the use of this word.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor were they to be called slant-eyes. They argued: “Our eyes are not slanted! It’s only because we have no fold in our eyelids that they look slanted.” But of course in this they were wrong. Reiko-chan’s little eyes were delightfully slanted, low near the nose and tilting upward in saucy angles. It was she who came home with one of their best games. Putting her two fingers at the corners of her lovely eyes, she pulled them way up and chanted, “My mother’s a Japanese.” Then she pulled them far down and sang, “And my father’s a Chinese.” Then, moving her forefingers to the middle of her eyebrows and her thumbs below, she spread her eyes wide apart and shouted, “But I’m a hundred per cent American.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kamejiro first saw this trick, he rebuked his daughter and reminded her: “The proudest thing in your life is that you’re a Japanese. Don’t ever laugh about it.” But at the same time he became vaguely aware that with the arrival of children his family had become entangled in values that were contradictory and mutually exclusive: he sent his offspring to American schools so that they would succeed in American life; but at the same time he kept them in Japanese school so that they would be prepared for their eventual return to Japan. The children felt this schizophrenia and one day at the close of the American school Goro went not to the Japanese teacher but directly home, where Kamejiro met him with the question, “Why are you home?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not going to the Japanese school any longer.” Kamejiro held his temper and asked patiently, “Why not?” “I don’t want to be a Japanese. I want to be an American.” For several moments Kamejiro held his hands to his side, in self-discipline, but he could not do so for long. Suddenly he grabbed his oldest son, lifted him in the air, tucked him under one arm and ran with him furiously to the temple, where after bowing ceremoniously to the priest, his son still under his arm, he threw the boy into the midst of the scholars. “He said he didn’t want to be a Japanese!” he stammered in rage, then bowed and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly the tall priest rose and reached for his rod. Moving silently in his bare feet to where Goro lay on the tatami, he began to flail the boy unmercifully. When he had finished he returned solemnly to his rostrum, sat meticulously upon the floor and cried in a quivering voice, “Sakagawa Goro, what are the first laws of life?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Love of country. Love of emperor. Respect for parents.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Even in their names, the Japanese children experienced this constant hauling in two directions. At the American school it was Goro Sakagawa; at the Japanese, Sakagawa Goro. And when the beating was over, Goro waited for an opportunity and whispered to his brother Tadao, “I will never go back to Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who spoke?” the priest cried sharply.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I did,” Goro replied. For him to lie would have been unthinkable.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did you say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I said that when I grow up I will never go back to Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Ominously the priest reached for the rod once more, and this time the beating he delivered was both longer and more severe. At the end he asked, “Now will you go back to Japan?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Goro stubbornly replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night the priest told Kamejiro, “We can have no boy like this in the Japanese school. He lacks the proper sincerity.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He will be back on Monday,” Kamejiro said dutifully, bowing before his intellectual superior. “Believe me, Sensei, he will be back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That was Wednesday evening, and when bruised Goro started to go to bed his father caught his hand and said quietly, “Oh, No! You will not sleep tonight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I must go to school tomorrow,” Goro pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. For you there is no more school. Tonight you start to work with me.” And Kamejiro made the boy dress in warm clothes and that night he took him on his rounds to clean out privies. Goro was appalled at the work his father did, at the humiliation of it, at the way late strolling drunks ridiculed him, at the stench. But bow-legged little Kamejiro said nothing. Hauling his son with him, he did his work, and at dawn the two night prowlers took their hot bath and breakfasted as the other children went to school.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights young Goro continued to clean out privies, until he felt so sick that he was afraid even to walk beside his resolute father. At dawn on Sunday, as the brilliant tropical sun came over Diamond Head, Kamejiro said to his son, “This is the way men have to work when they do not have an education. Are you ready to apologize to the priest?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you’re ready to apply yourself … in both schools?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On Monday afternoon Kamejiro took Goro back to the temple and stood in the doorway while his son announced to the entire class: “I apologize to all of Japan for what I said last Wednesday. I apologize to you, Sensei, for my evil behavior. I apologize to you, Father, for having been such an ungrateful son.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you now willing to go back to Japan?” the priest asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Sensei.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then sit down and we will resume our studies.” After that experience, there were no more disturbances among the Sakagawa children.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was one item of education which Kamejiro could delegate to no one. Whenever he took his family for a stroll through Kakaako he kept on the alert, and from time to time would grasp his left wrist with his right hand, and then his children knew. “Is that one?” the boys whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s one,” Kamejiro replied in hoarse, awe-struck tones, and in this way the Sakagawas learned to spot the Etas, those untouchables who had filtered into Hawaii. Mrs. Sakagawa lectured Reiko-chan concerning the worst fate that could befall any girl: “There was a girl in Kakaako named Itagaki, and without knowing it she married an Eta. Her family had to go to another island in disgrace.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There were ways a self-respecting family could protect itself from Etas, and Kamejiro often told his children, “When the time comes for you to marry, I’ll go to the detective and he will tell me whether the other party is an Eta or an Okinawan.” There were two such detectives in Hawaii, and since they kept dossiers on every Japanese family, few Etas or Okinawans were unknown to them. Their services were costly, but since they enabled prospective brides and grooms to avoid the shame of mismating, the general community was willing to pay their fee.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, as Reiko-chan approached the age when she must move on to a more advanced school, her father’s attention was diverted from Etas and directed to a matter of more immediate importance. The haole citizens of Hawaii, properly disturbed by the abominable English spoken in the schools, united to demand at least one school on each island where all children would speak acceptable English, and out of this agitation the so-called English-standard school developed. To attain entrance a child had to undergo a verbal examination to prove that he was not corrupted by pidgin and would thus not contaminate his classmates, who were usually trying to gain entrance to some mainland college.</p>

  <p class="normal">The basic concept of the English-standard school was meritorious, for in other schools there often appeared to be no standards at all and even teachers sometimes taught in pidgin; but the manner in which students were selected for these superior schools was one of the most shameful subterfuges ever permitted in the islands. Plantation managers soon let it be known that they would look with disfavor upon teachers who admitted to the preferred schools too many children of Oriental ancestry; so automatically the schools became costly private schools with superior facilities paid for out of general taxation but largely restricted to haole children. This discrimination was easy to enforce, for teachers who interviewed prospective enrollees were encouraged to disbar any child who evidenced even the slightest accent or the misuse of a single word; and a miserable mockery developed whereby teachers, who knew they were under the surveillance of plantation managers, conducted tests of Japanese and Filipino children, whose failures were ordained before they spoke a word. Of course, a few sons of Oriental doctors and lawyers were admitted, lest the abuse of tax dollars become too odious, but for the most part the English-standard school became another device to keep Orientals on the plantations, where they were supposed to belong. As Hoxworth Hale pointed out, when as a member of the Board of Education, he encouraged the establishment of the schools: “We mustn’t educate field hands beyond their capacity.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In Honolulu the English-standard school was Jefferson, a superb institution with superior playing fields, laboratories and teachers. With real anxiety Japanese fathers like Kamejiro Sakagawa watched the results of the first entrance tests at Jefferson. Almost no Japanese children gained admittance, and Kamejiro warned: “See! You lazy children who will not study. None of your friends got into the fine school! But you will get in, because from now on you will study twice as much as before.” He launched an ingenious program whereby his five children attended two different Christian churches each Sunday, listening to the preacher use good English. At any free public lecture, there would be Kamejiro and his five children. He could not understand what was being said, but when he got the young students home he would seat them in a circle and make them repeat again and again, what the speaker had said, in the speaker’s intonation. Before long, Reiko-chan and Goro were adept in English.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Sakagawa children had now reached the apex of their educational schizophrenia. In their American school they learned that all people were created equal, but their father kept teaching them who the Etas were, and the Okinawans. In their Japanese school they learned formal Japanese and were beaten if they made mistakes, but at night they drilled one another in proper English. Their parents spoke little of the language, but they insisted that their children converse with each other in English. It was a crazy, conflicting world, but there was this refuge of assurance: when they were with other children like themselves they spoke only a wild, free pidgin whose syllables sang on the ear like the breaking of waves along the beach.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Reiko-chan was a long-legged, flashing-eyed girl of twelve she was ready to take her all-important verbal examination for admission into the privileges of Jefferson. Her parents washed her with unusual care, dressed her in a white smock with ruffles, and polished her shoes. Kamejiro wanted to accompany her, but she begged him not to do so, only to find when she got to Jefferson that he was required to be with her. She ran back to get him, and when her mother saw how heated up she had become in doing so, she was given another bath, and with her father’s apprehensive hand in hers she returned to Jefferson, where a teacher picked up the report from Reiko’s elementary school and read silently: “Reiko Sakagawa. Grades A. Behavior A. Knowledge of American customs A. English A.” The investigating teacher smiled and passed the report approvingly along to the other two members of the board, but one of these had at her elbow an additional report on the Sakagawa girl, and this said simply, “Father, privy cleaner.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you spend your days this summer?” the first teacher asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a sweet, clear voice Reiko-chan replied, with careful attention to each syllable, “I help my mother with the washing. And on Sundays I go to church. And when we have a picnic I help my brothers get dressed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The three teachers were impressed with the precision of the little girl’s speech. Obviously she was a girl who belonged in whatever excellent schools a community could provide, and the first teacher was about to mark the official ballot “Passed,” when the third teacher whispered, “Did you see this? Her father?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The damning paper was passed from hand to hand and the teachers nodded. “Failed,” wrote the first. Then, smiling sweetly at Reiko-chan, she explained: “We are not going to accept you at Jefferson, my dear. We feel that you speak a little too deliberately … as if you had memorized.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no appeal. Kamejiro and his brilliant daughter were led away and in the summer sunlight the father asked in Japanese, “Did you get in?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” she said, trying desperately not to cry.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” her father asked in dumb pain.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They said I spoke too slowly,” she explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Kamejiro, and not Reiko-chan, who began to weep. He looked at the fine school, at the lovely grounds, and realized what a great boon his family had lost. “Why, why?” he pleaded. “At home you talk like a fire machine! Why do you talk slow today?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wanted to be so careful,” Reiko-chan explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro felt that his daughter had failed the family through some conscious error, and his rage overcame him. Raising his arm, he was about to punish her when he saw that tears were hanging in her eyes, so instead of thrashing her as he intended, he dropped on one knee and embraced her. “Don’t worry,” he said. “Goro will get in. Maybe it’s even better that way, because he’s a boy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he grabbed his daughter lovingly by the hand and said, “We must hurry,” and the event toward which he hurried proved how deeply confused he was, for after having tried with all his prayers to get Reiko-chan into Jefferson so that she could be even more American, he now rushed her back home and into a kimono so that she could join her brothers in demonstrating that she was perpetually a Japanese. For this was the emperor’s birthday, and the community was assembling at the Japanese school. As each family entered, the parents bowed almost to the floor before the portrait of the august emperor, then led their children to an allotted place on the tatami, where they sat on their ankles. At eleven the teacher appeared, ashen-faced, so grave was his responsibility that day. A former army officer rose and explained, “In Japan today, if the teacher who reads the Imperial Prescript mispronounces even one word or stumbles once, he is required to commit hara-kiri. Let us pay attention as we hear the immortal words of the Emperor Meiji as to what makes a good Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly, painfully, the teacher began reading. In Japanese life the Imperial Prescript was unlike anything that western nations knew. It had started out in 1890 as a simple announcement of what Japan’s educational policy should be, but the nation had found its clear statement of citizenship so appealing that the Prescript had been made immortal. Children and soldiers had to memorize it and lead their lives according to its precepts. It taught love of country, complete subjugation to the divine will of the emperor, and obedience to all authority. In beautiful language it taught a staggering theory of life, and in humble attention to it, Japan had grown strong. When the teacher ended his reading of the terrifying words, huge drops of perspiration stood out on his forehead, and each member of his audience was freshly dedicated to Japan and willing to sacrifice his life at the command of the emperor.</p>

  <p class="normal">The army officer rose and said, “Let us remember Japan!” And all bowed, thinking of that distant, sweet and lovely land.</p>

  <p class="normal">The crowd now went outside, where an arena had been set up, and two enormous men visiting from Japan waited, stripped down to the merest loincloths, and after a priest had prayed over them, they went to their respective comers of the arena and grabbed handfuls of salt, which they scattered about the mat upon which they were to wrestle. Kamejiro whispered to his attentive boys, “Haoles who say Japanese are runty should see these men!” The preparations continued with painful deliberateness for forty minutes, then in a flash of speed, the two giants crashed into one another, groaned and hefted until one pushed the other across the boundary. The Japanese cheered, then burst into hilarious laughter as two of their own fatties, men from the plantations, appeared nearly naked to conduct their own wrestling match.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the afternoon, officials from the consulate drove up in a black car and told the listeners, “Grave events are shaping up in Asia. The perpetual evil of China once more threatens us, and we cannot say what fearful measures our august emperor may be required to take. On this solemn day, may we rededicate our lives to the land we love.” There was a great deal more about the ominous events that imperiled the homeland, but nobody was very clear as to what they were. However, a collection was taken to aid the emperor in this hour of need, and the Sakagawas contributed money that had been intended for a new dress for Reiko-chan. She was allowed to place the coins in the box, and she quivered with love of Japan as she did so.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the celebrants moved to the public square in Kakaako, where under a banyan tree they performed the ancient, ritualistic bon dances of Japan. The children were an important part of this dance, weaving in slow measures in and out, their colorful kimonos swaying in the soft night breezes, and one group of elderly ladies, who had learned their own dances in villages thousands of miles from Hawaii, found tears in their eyes as they watched delicate Reiko-chan moving through the graceful figures. One old woman asked, “I wonder if she knows how beautiful she is? Such a flawless skin and her eyes so Japanese!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro, who overheard these words of praise, blushed and told the women, “We are training Reiko-chan so that when she returns to Japan she will be recognized as a fine Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She is one now,” the women said approvingly.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the emperor’s birthday celebration ended, the old confusions returned, and Kamejiro warned his sons, in one breath, “This sacred day should remind you of how important it is that we get our family back to Japan,” and, “You boys saw that Reiko-chan missed getting into Jefferson. You are not to miss.” So the tiny Sakagawa shack became a drill hall with all the children speaking English.</p>

  <p class="normal">Even in its first year Jefferson demonstrated its success. With better teachers and better facilities it promised to turn out graduates who were proficient in English and who were sure to make good records at mainland colleges. Some of the plantation owners began to wonder if perhaps the English-standard schools weren’t too good. Hoxworth Hale observed: “Why you get almost as fine an education at Jefferson as you do at Punahou. No tax-supported school has to be that good.” But there were other protests of a more serious nature, for it had become apparent to laboring groups that their children were not going to be admitted to the superior schools, no matter how proficient their English, and some radical labor men began to argue: “We pay taxes to support these fine schools to educate those who don’t need them. It is our own children who ought to be going to those schools, for then the differences between groups in the community would be diminished.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sometimes at night, as Kamejiro listened to Reiko-chan drilling her brothers in English, he thought: “Everybody in Hawaii has it better than the Japanese. Look at those damned Kees! They have big stores and their sons go to Punahou. When the Chinese came to Hawaii, things were easy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now it was Goro’s turn to try his luck at Jefferson, and like his sister he reported to the jury of three teachers. Like her he brought with him a rather striking report: “Grades A. Behavior B. Knowledge of American customs A. English A. This boy has unusual capacities in history.” The test began, and he spoke with delightful fluency, explaining the Civil War to the teachers.</p>

  <p class="normal">It looked as if they would have to accept him, when one teacher used a device that had been found effective in testing a child’s real knowledge of English. She slowly lifted a piece of paper and tore it in half.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did I do to the paper?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You broke it,” Goro said promptly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the teacher tore the paper and asked, “What did I do to it this time?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You broke it again,” Goro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re sorry,” the chairman announced. “She tore the paper. The word is tore.” And Goro was rejected.</p>

  <p class="normal">When his father heard the news he asked dumbly, “What was the word again?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro explained, “I said broke when I should have said tore.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Broke!” Kamejiro cried in anguish. “Broke!” He did not know the word himself, but he was outraged that his son should have misused it. He began beating him about the shoulders, crying, “How many times have I told you not to say broke? You stupid, stupid boy!” And he continued hammering his son, not realizing that if it had not been the word broke it would have been some other, for the children of Japanese men who dug out privies were not intended to enter Jefferson.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1936 Kamejiro Sakagawa faced a most difficult decision, for it became apparent that his grand design of educating five children from kindergarten through graduate school could not be attained. The hard-working family simply did not have the money to keep going. It was therefore necessary that some, at least, of the children quit school and go to work, and discussions as to the various courses open to the Sakagawas kept the family awake many nights.</p>

  <p class="normal">The fault was not Kamejiro’s. He would have been able to maintain the four boys in school and at the same time permit Reiko-chan to begin her university course except that news from China was increasingly bad. Time after time either the priest at the language school or the consular officials reported to the Japanese community that the emperor was facing the gravest crisis in Japanese history. “This sacred man,” the priest intoned, “tries to sleep at night with the burden of all Japan on his shoulders. The very least you can do is to support our armies in their victorious march across China.” The armies were always on the verge of victory, and certainly the Japanese newsreels showed the capture of one new province each week, but the Japanese forces never seemed to get anywhere, and in August of that year the consular official made a very blunt statement: “I want fifty thousand dollars sent from these islands to help save the Japanese army.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Sakagawas contributed seventy of those dollars and that night assembled the family. “Reiko-chan cannot go to college,” Kamejiro said bluntly. The brilliant little girl, president of the girls’ club at McKinley and an honor student, sat primly with her hands in her lap. As a good Japanese daughter she said nothing, but Goro did. “She knows more than any of us. She’s got to go to college. Then she can become a teacher and help pay our way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Girls get married,” Kamejiro rationalized quietly. “Pretty girls get married right away, and the education and income are lost.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She could promise not to get married,” Goro suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is boys who must be educated,” Kamejiro pointed out, “though why both you and Tadao failed to get yourselves into Jefferson I cannot understand. Are you stupid? Why don’t you learn to speak English right?” he fumed in Japanese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please,” the gentle girl begged, “you’ve seen that only the sons of people the plantation leaders like get into the good schools.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro turned to look at his daughter. The idea she had suggested was startling to him and repugnant. “Is that right?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course it’s right,” Reiko-chan replied. “And Minoru and Shigeo won’t get in, either.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing wrong with McKinley,” Goro snapped, defending the wonderful rabbit-warren of a school where Orientals and Portuguese and indigent haoles went. It was a comfortable, congenial school, arrogant in its use of pidgin even in classrooms, and many of the islands’ political leaders graduated from it, even if none of the business tycoons did. A boy could get his jaw broken at McKinley for speaking good English, but he could also get a good education, for the school always contained dedicated teachers who loved to see brilliant boys like Goro prosper.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Forget McKinley,” Kamejiro told his children. “What kind of job can Reiko-chan get that will bring in the most money?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let her work for three years, then Tadao and I can get jobs,” Goro suggested, “and she can go on to the university.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Kamejiro corrected. “I have noticed that if boys stop, they never go back. Reiko-chan must work from now on.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was at this point that the quiet girl almost sobbed, and her brothers saw the involuntary contraction of her shoulders. Goro, a big husky boy, larger than his father, went to his sister’s chair and put his hand on her arm. “Pop’s right,” he said in English. “You’ll get married. Pretty girl like you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We speak in Japanese!” Kamejiro rebuked. “Sit down. Now what kind of job?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I could be a typist,” Reiko suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They pay nothing for Japanese typists,” Kamejiro replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could she work for a doctor?” Tadao asked. He was a slim, wiry boy, taller than Goro but not nearly so rugged. “That’s good pay.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s got to have training, and we have no money,” Kamejiro replied. He waited for a moment, almost afraid to discuss openly what was in his mind. Then he swallowed and said, “I was talking with Ishii-san and he said . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please, Father!” the boys interrupted. “Not Ishii-san! If you listen to what he says . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ishii-san’s a fool,” Reiko laughed. “Everyone knows that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This family is indebted to Ishii-san,” Kamejiro said forcefully. He often used this phrase, but he never explained to the children why they were indebted to the curious little man whose ideas got stranger each year. “And Ishii-san pointed out that the easiest way for a Japanese to make lots of money is …” He paused dramatically.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Stealing!” Goro joked in English. His father knew something irreverent had been said, but not what, so he ignored his son.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ishii-san is going to lend me the money,” Kamejiro explained with nervous excitement, “and I am going to open a small barbershop on Hotel Street where the sailors are. And all the chairs will have girl barbers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly, as if gripped by a nameless horror, the four boys turned to look at their pretty sister. She sat apart, watching her mother, who was washing rice, but in her silence the color left her cheeks, for she understood that her immediate destiny was not the university or nursing or stenography; she was going to be a lady barber. She knew that there was already one shop of lady barbers on Hotel Street, and men flocked in and whoever owned the shop was making a lot of money, and the girls were getting tips. “But who are the girls?” Reiko thought mutely. “They have hardly been through grammar school.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So I have asked Sakai-san if he would allow his daughter Chizuko to work for me,” Kamejiro reported, exuding hope, “and he said yes, if I watch her closely and prevent her from becoming familiar with strange men. And Rumiko Hasegawa will work with us too, so that with three chairs and with me to sweep up and shine shoes, we ought to do very well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Unexpectedly, Goro threw his arms on the table and began to weep. When his father asked, “Now what’s wrong?” the sixteen-year-old boy mumbled, “Reiko-chan is the best one of us all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then she will be willing to help her brothers get their education,” Kamejiro said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the mother, from her comer where she was preparing food, spoke, and she observed: “It is the duty of a Japanese girl to help her family. I helped mine when I was young, and it made me a better wife. If Reiko-chan works hard and earns her own money, she will appreciate it more when her husband gives her some to spend on her children. It is her duty.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But a lady barber!” Goro cried through his sobs.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As a barber she will earn more money,” his mother replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro rushed to his sister and embraced her. “When I become a lawyer and make a million dollars,” he said in rapid English, “it will all be yours.” The tears coursed down his face. Then Tadao, who was doing exceptionally well in school, but not so well as his sister had done in the same classes, began to weep, and the two younger boys, who knew how their sister had dreamed of becoming a teacher, sobbed. This was too much for Kamejiro, whose cruel duty it had been to make this decision, and he began to find tears splashing down his cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only Mrs. Sakagawa did not cry. “It is her duty,” she assured her trembling menfolk, but then she saw the tears in her lovely daughter’s eyes, and she could no longer hide the fact that duty is often too terrible to bear. Gathering her child to her bosom, she wept.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro Sakagawa’s barbershop was an immense success. It opened just as American military installations in Hawaii were beginning to boom, so that navy men from Pearl Harbor and army boys from Schofield Barracks crowded into Hotel Street to get tattooed by local artists and shaved by lady barbers. But the principal reason for Kamejiro’s prosperity was the crystal-like beauty of the three Japanese girls who staffed his chairs. They were olive-skinned, dark-haired, soft-eyed young ladies who looked especially appealing in crisp white uniforms which they delighted in keeping clean. Men often dropped by just for an extra trim to watch the girls, for there was the double excitement of a lady barber who was also a Japanese. Before long, regular customers were begging the pretty girls for dates.</p>

  <p class="normal">That was where Kamejiro came in. Early in the life of his barbershop he had taught his girls how to stab with their scissors fresh customers who were trying to feel their legs. He also showed them that one of the best ways to handle difficult suitors was to push a hot towel in the man’s face just as he was making his proposal. He encouraged his girls to discourage persistent Lotharios by nicking them slightly with the razor, especially on the ear lobe where one bled freely, but this gambit sometimes had reverse results, for the girls usually felt repentance for this act and made over the wounded customer so prettily, daubing him with styptic and asking in a sweet voice, “Does it hurt?” that the men came back stronger than before.</p>

  <p class="normal">At closing time each night there were loungers outside in Hotel Street waiting for the girls, but Kamejiro formed his barbers into a squad, marched them to the Sakai girl’s home, and cried proudly, “Sakai-san! Here’s your daughter safe and sound.” He then marched to the Hasegawas’ and cried, “Here’s Rumiko, safe and sound.” At the doorway to his own home he invariably informed his wife, “Here’s our girl, safe at home.” The Japanese community marveled at how well Kamejiro was doing, and all agreed that his Reiko-chan was a most excellent barber.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then in 1938, during Goro’s last year at McKinley High, a real bombshell struck the Sakagawa family, an event so unanticipated that it left the household breathless. One afternoon in late July three men in blue suits came to the house in Kakaako and asked, “Mrs. Sakagawa, where’s Tadao?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Yoriko could speak little English, so she said, “Tadao, he not here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When he come home?” one of the men in a stiff white collar asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Me not know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tonight?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hontoni, hontoni!” she nodded. “For sure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You tell him to wait here,” the men said, and if they had smiled, as they should have done, they would have eased the apprehensions of the Sakagawa household enormously, but they did not, for Mrs. Sakagawa, hunched up from great work and somewhat wrinkled, scared them, and they stared at her as she stared at them.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the family convened that night, Mrs. Sakagawa was the center of attraction. Four times she acted her role in the afternoon’s ominous encounter, and everyone began pressing seventeen-year-old Tadao for the details of what offense he had committed, for the family assumed that the men were detectives. No other haoles in blue suits and white collars ever visited Japanese homes, and slowly the unincriminated members of the Sakagawa family began to coalesce against the first Sakagawa boy to have gotten into trouble. The awful, terrifying rectitude of the Japanese family asserted itself, and Reiko-chan cried, “You, Tadao. What did you do? All day I work and see no-goods on Hotel Street. Is my brother to be one of these?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tadao!” Kamejiro cried, banging the table. “What wrong thing have you done?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall, quiet boy could not answer, so his stockier brother Goro shouted, “You and your damned foolishness! Suppose the police take you, no more teams at McKinley for you. And I’ll be ashamed to go on the field. Tell us! What have you done?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The guiltless and bewildered boy shivered before the anger of his family. So far as he knew he had done nothing, yet the men had been there. Kamejiro, who had worked desperately hard to keep his family decent Japanese of whom Hiroshima would be proud, saw that his efforts had come to naught, and began mumbling in his hands. “No man can bring children up right,” he swore, his chin trembling with shame and sorrow.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a knock at the door, and the Sakagawas looked at each other with last-minute dismay. “You stand there!” Kamejiro whispered to his son, placing him where the men could reach him. There would be no running away in his family. Then, biting his lip to hide his disgrace, he opened the door.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Sakagawa?” the leader asked. “I’m Hewlett Janders, and this is John Whipple Hoxworth, and this gentleman in back,” and he laughed easily, “this is Hoxworth Hale. Good evening.” The three business leaders of Hawaii entered the small room, stood awkwardly for a moment, then laughed when Reiko called in English, “Boys, get them some chairs!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We could use some,” big Hewlett Janders laughed. “Mighty fine house you have here, Mr. Sakagawa. Rarely see such beautiful flowers any more. You must have a green thumb.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro translated rapidly and Kamejiro bowed. “Tell them I love flowers,” he said. Goro translated this and apologized: “Father is ashamed of his English.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You certainly handle the language well,” Hewlett replied. “You’re Goro, I take it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The three men looked at him approvingly, and finally Hewlett said, jokingly, “You’re the young fellow we hate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro blushed, and Reiko-chan interrupted, asking, “We thought it was Tadao you wanted to see. This is Tadao.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We know, Miss Sakagawa. But this is the young rascal we worry about.”</p>

  <a id="section_1"></a>

  <p class="normal">There was a moment’s suspense. No one quite knew what was happening, nor what odd turn this strange meeting was going to take next. It was Hoxworth Hale, oldest and most prim of the visitors who spoke, and as always he tried to speak to the heart of the matter. “We are an informal alumni committee from Punahou School. We’re sick and tired of seeing our team ran over by first-class athletes like this Goro over here. Young man, you have a marvelous future. Basketball, baseball and most of all football. If you ever need any help, come see me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you didn’t come to arrest one of us?” Reiko-chan asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good heavens no!” Hale replied. “Did we give that impression this afternoon?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My mother doesn’t understand . . .” Reiko began, but the relief she felt was so great that she could not speak. She put her hand to her mouth to stop its quivering, then put her arm about Tadao.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good gracious no!” Hale continued. “Quite the contrary, Miss Sakagawa. In fact, we’re so impressed by your family that we’ve come here tonight to offer your brother Tadao a full scholarship at Punahou, because we need a running halfback like him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">No one spoke. The older Sakagawas, not comprehending what was happening, looked at Goro for translation, but before he could begin, Big Hewlett Janders dapped his arm about the boy’s shoulder and said, “We wanted you, too, Goro, but we felt that since you’re a senior, you probably ought to finish at McKinley. Besides, we have fairly good tackles at school. But you’ve got to promise one thing. In the Punahou game, don’t tackle your brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll tear him to shreds if he’s Punahou,” Goro laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You wrecked us for the past two years,” Janders acknowledged, punching the boy in a friendly manner.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Tadao spoke. “How could I pay my way at Punahou?” he asked. “Besides the tuition, that is?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll be there two years,” Hale explained. “No charges at all for tuition or books. You can have a job right now at H &amp; H taking care of forms. And completely off the record, we would like to give you one hundred dollars, twenty now, the rest later, for some clothes and things like that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">John Whipple Hoxworth, a sharp-eyed, quick-minded man added, “Tell your father that we are doing this not only because you have great promise as a football player, but because we know you are a fine boy. If you were otherwise, we wouldn’t want you at Punahou.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth Hale said, “It won’t be too easy for you, son. There aren’t many Japanese at Punahou. You’ll be alone and lonely.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko-chan answered for her brother: “It’s the best school in the islands. To go there would be worth anything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We think so,” Hale replied. And the three men shook hands with Tadao, the new boy at Punahou.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the men were gone, Kamejiro exploded. “What happened?” he shouted at Goro.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tadao has been accepted at Punahou,” the interpreter replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Punahou!” The name had rarely been mentioned in the Sakagawa household. It was a school that had no reality to the Japanese, a haole heaven, a forbidden land. A Japanese boy could logically aspire to Jefferson, and in recent years some were making it, but Punahou! Kamejiro sat down, bewildered. “Who applied to Punahou?” he mumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nobody. The school came to him because he has good grades and can play football.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How will he pay?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They have already paid him,” Goro explained, pointing to Tadao’s money.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was at this point, as Kamejiro studied the twenty dollars, that the Sakagawa family as a whole acknowledged for the first time, openly and honestly, that the boys would probably not return to Japan; for they could see Tadao at Punahou, one of America’s greatest schools, working with the finest people in the islands, and graduating and going on to college and university. He would become a doctor or a lawyer, and his life would be spent here in America; and the family looked at him in this moment of realization and they saw him as forever lost to Japan; for this was the power of education.</p>

  <p class="normal">The three blue-suited alumni who visited that night had warned Tadao that life at Punahou would be difficult, but the source of the difficulty they failed to identify. It came not from Punahou, where Tadao’s football prowess won respect, but from Kakaako, where the submerged people had long ago suspected Tadao because of his mastery of English. Now he was openly stigmatized as a haole-lover, and six times in September, Kakaako gangs waylaid him as he came home from football practice and beat him thoroughly. “We’ll teach you to be better than we are!” they warned him. When he made three touchdowns against a team mainly of Japanese and other pidgin-speakers, they hammered him desperately, shouting, “You goddamned traitor! Who do you think you are, playing for Punahou?” Tadao never tried to enlist Goro’s aid. This punishment from Kakaako was something he had to absorb. He learned to keep his hands over his face so that his teeth would not be broken, and he quickly mastered the art of using his feet and knees as lethal weapons. By mid-October the assaults ended, especially since McKinley was having a good year with Goro as one of its brightest stars.</p>

  <p class="normal">This football business in Honolulu was one of the strangest aberrations in the Pacific. Because Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos were mad about games, and because haoles like Janders, Hoxworth and Hale constantly, recalled their days of glory at Punahou, the islands were sports-crazy and the easiest way to sell a newspaper was to work up a frenzy over football or basketball. Having no college league to focus on, the entire community bore down on the high schools. Radio commentators reported breathlessly that Akaiamu Kalanianaole had damaged a tendon in his right foot and would not be able to play Saturday for Hewlett Hall. Newspapers carried enormous photographs of fifteen-year-old boys, growling ferociously under captions like “Tiger Chung About to Tear into Punahou.” Youths who should have been thinking of themselves as unshaven adolescents having trouble with the square roots of decimals, were forced to believe that they were minor Red Granges, and all the publicity that on the mainland was thrown at mature professional athletes, was in Hawaii directed at callow youths in nigh school. Consequently, from one year to the next, disgraceful scandals erupted in which adult gamblers bribed these boys to throw games. Then headlines moralized over the lack of character-training in the schools and occasionally some bewildered lad was actually thrown into jail for “corrupting the fabric of our sports world,” while the adult gamblers who framed him went free.</p>

  <p class="normal">At no time did this great Hawaiian nonsense flourish with more abandon than in the fall of 1938 when Goro Sakagawa was playing his last year at McKinley and his brother Tadao his first at Punahou. As the Thanksgiving Day classic between the two schools approached, all the local newspapers carried flamboyant stories about the two dramatic young men. The Mail got a fine shot of their father Kamejiro standing before his barbershop with a Punahou pennant in one hand, a McKinley banner in the other. “Impartial!” the caption read. It was one of the first pictures of a Japanese other than a criminal or an embassy official to appear outside the sports pages of a Honolulu newspaper.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the day of the game there were two half-page spreads, one of Goro looking like an insane bulldog about to tear a squirrel apart and one of Tadao straight-arming an imaginary tackier. “Brother against Brother” read the headlines, two inches tall. It was a great game, and except for an extraordinary play by Goro in the last fifteen seconds, Tadao’s three flaming touchdowns would have led Punahou to victory. That night, as he walked home through Kakaako, confused by the plaudits of the huge crowd who had eulogized him as the star of the Punahou team, he got his worst beating from the toughs. When they left him they warned: “Don’t you never play like that against McKinley again!”</p>

  <p class="normal">He stumbled home, his face bleeding from three different cuts, and Goro had had enough. “You know who did it?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s go!” They took sixteen-year-old Minoru and fifteen-year-old Shigeo along. Goro gave each a baseball bat or a railing from a picket fence, and they cruised Kakaako until they came upon seven members of the gang. “No mercy!” Goro whispered, and with deadly efficiency the four brothers moved in. Next morning the newspapers, writing of the game, called it, “Triumph of the Sakagawa Brothers,” and when Goro saw the headline he told Tadao, “We didn’t do so bad last night, either.”</p>

  <p class="normal">While the Sakagawa boys were thus clawing their way up the ladder of island life, boys of Hawaiian ancestry were enjoying quite a different experience. When old Abraham Hewlett on the island of Maui took as his second wife a handsome Hawaiian girl, he found that her family owned about half of what was to become the hotel area of Waikiki. Eventually the Hewlett lands were valued at over one million dollars an acre, and because of the far-sighted missionary generosity of old Abraham, the entire income was applied to Hewlett Hall, where boys and girls of Hawaiian blood were entitled to a free education. Under the guidance of a board usually composed exclusively of Hales, Hewletts and Whipples, the famous Hawaiian school developed into a marvelous institution. It had a sparkling band, one of the finest choruses in the islands, loving teachers and handsome dormitories. All was free, and an outsider looking casually at the school could have been forgiven if he had concluded: “Hewlett Hall has been the salvation of the Hawaiian race.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, the facts were somewhat contrary. Physically, Hewlett Hall was about perfect, but intellectually it was limited by the vision of the great families who dominated its board. They sent their sons to Punahou and Yale. It never seriously occurred to them that Hawaiian boys had exactly the same capacities as haoles; consequently, they consciously forced Hewlett Hall into a trade-school mold; its directors, with the greatest love in the world, rationalized: “The Hawaiians are a delightful, relaxed race. They love to sing and play games. They make wonderful mechanics and chauffeurs. Their girls are excellent teachers. Let us encourage them to do these things even better.” And the Hawaiians, by their own friends, were so encouraged.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now in the old days when a brilliant Chinese boy had fallen under the wing of preposterous Uliassutai Karakorum Blake, he was told daily: “You are as great a human being as I have ever known. There is nothing of which you are not capable.” And these boys grew into doctors, political leaders and bankers. When outstanding Japanese boys like Goro Sakagawa crammed themselves into McKinley High—called locally Mikado Prep—they invariably found some inspired woman teacher imported from Kansas or Minnesota who told them: “You have a mind that can accomplish anything. You could write great books or become a fine research doctor. You can do anything.” So the Chinese boys and the Japanese battled their way to proficiency, but the Hawaiians were not so goaded. They were given everything free and were encouraged to become trustworthy mechanics, and no society has ever been ruled by trustworthy mechanics and loyal schoolteachers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Back in 1907 when Dr. Hewlett Whipple was made a member of the board for Hewlett Hall, he had tried manfully to revitalize the curriculum and to find dynamic teachers like old Uliassutai Karakoram Blake, but the Hales and Hewletts stopped him: “We must not try to educate these fine Hawaiian children above their natural capacity.” After three years of futile struggling, Dr. Whipple resigned, and on the night he quit he told his wife, “With love and money we have condemned these people to perpetual mediocrity. Hewlett Hall is the worst thing that has happened to the Hawaiians since the arrival of measles and the white man.” So while the Chinese and Japanese learned to manipulate their society, the Hawaiians did not.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THE FALL</span> of 1941 Honolulu was presented with evidence that Punahou, at least, was capable of producing young scholars who could turn out historical research of high literary merit. Proof appeared in the form of a mimeographed pamphlet late one Friday afternoon as school was dismissing, and by Friday night the entire haole community had heard of it, with widely varying reactions; even some of the Orientals, by habit indifferent to literary accomplishment, were chuckling.</p>

  <p class="normal">No one reacted more violently than Hoxworth Hale, a sedate man, for by the time he had finished reading the fourth line of the manifesto he was apoplectic and felt, with reason, that a scandal had occurred which required action, a conclusion which the officials at Punahou had acted upon an hour earlier. Later, when he reviewed the matter, Hoxworth realized that he should have anticipated trouble, for he recalled that for some time his son Bromley had been behaving mysteriously.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the aid of a professional carpenter, whom he paid out of his own funds, young Brom had erected a curious structure on the back lot, and when asked what it was, he repeatedly insisted: “A play pen for adults.” It stood unrelated to anything else, a half-room, with no ceiling and only two wooden walls, into which were cut four small openings, in back of which were built little boxes. The ridiculous structure did have a wooden floor, five feet ten inches long by five feet one inch wide. Two-by-fours propped up the walls, and Hoxworth noted that several of his son’s friends were working on the project. One day, for example, crew-cut young Whipple Janders, with a new Leica picked up on his family s last trip to Germany, had called, “Hey, Mr. Hale. Would you help us a minute?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What can I do, Whip?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want you to model this contraption.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Only if you tell me what it is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brom calls it a play pen for adults,” Whipple had explained. “Some crazy idea of his.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How do you want me to model it?” Hoxworth had asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to see if a grown man could fit into one of our little boxes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean in there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. It’s well braced.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You want me to climb in?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure. Use the ladder.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth was perpetually unprepared for the blase’ manner in which modern children ordered their parents around, and with some misgivings he climbed into the bizarre box, stretched his legs out as far as they would reach, and laughed pleasantly at young Whipple Janders.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I should have an Arrow collar on,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re in sharp focus just as you are, sir,” Whip replied, snapping several shots with his Leica. “Thank you very much, Mr. Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth, reading the inflammatory publication, thought back on those scenes and acknowledged that he had been tipped off. Whatever happened now was in part his fault. “But how can you anticipate children?” he groaned. The publication bore this title:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em><span>SEX</span> ABOARD&#160; THE&#160; BRIGANTINE</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>or</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>They Couldn’t Have Been Seasick All the Time</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>or</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em><span>THERE WAS</span> FRIGGIN’ IN <span>THE</span> RIGGIN’</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>A speculative essay on missionaries by Bromley Whipple Hale</em></p>

  <p class="normal">“It is acknowledged by my many and devoted friends at Punahou that I yield to no man in my respect for the missionary stock from which I, and many of my most intimate friends, derive. I count among my dearest possessions the time-worn memorials that have come down in my family, those treasured reminders of the hardships which my forebears suffered in rounding the Horn in their thirst for salvation through good deeds. But more precious I count the blood of those stalwart souls as it courses through my veins and makes me the young man I am today. Therefore, when I speak of certain inquiries of a scientific nature which I have been conducting as an outgrowth of my studies in a revered school which itself has certain mission overtones, and where I have imbibed only the purest instruction, I speak as a Hale, a Whipple, a Bromley and a Hewlett. In fact, I may ask in all modesty, a trait for which I have been noted by my friends: Who of my generation, the sixth, could speak with greater propriety of mission matters? In equal modesty I would have to reply: No one.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bred as I was on missionary mythologies, I have always been profoundly impressed by several aspects of the long journey from Boston to Hawaii as undertaken by my ancestors. There was dreadful seasickness, from which almost all suffered constantly. There was binding biliousness which yellowed the eye and slowed the step, much as constipation does in our less euphemistic age. There were cramped quarters shared by eight where common decency required that there should have been only two. And there were the inconveniences of no fresh laundry, the same stinking clothes used week after week, and the uncontrollable boredom of fie in unaccustomed quarters.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No mission child has suffered more from a vicarious contemplation of these hardships than I. In fact, I have recently gone so far as to reconstruct the actual conditions under which my forebears struggled against the sea, and for several nights I have tried to live as they must have lived, endeavoring by these means to project myself into their reactions. In the first pictures that accompany this essay will be found my responses to the hardships borne by my ancestors.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth Hale turned the page gingerly and found that Whipple Janders’ Leica had been used to excellent effect. From the bunk leered Bromley Hale, his body contorted by the narrow quarters and . . .</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good God!” Hoxworth gasped. “Isn’t that Mandy Janders?” He studied the next photograph, which showed how husband and wife slept in the narrow bunks, and sure enough, there was his son Bromley Hale snoring while pretty, long-legged Amanda Janders, in a poke bonnet, lay beside him, staring in disgust. “Oh, my God! I’d better call Mandy’s father right away,” he said weakly, but the essay held him captive, just as it was imprisoning everyone in Honolulu lucky enough to possess one of the three hundred mimeographed copies accompanied by Whip Janders’ glossy photos.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As can be clearly seen,” Bromley Kale’s essay continued, “life aboard the brigantines must have been exactly as bad as our forebears have reported. But it has always seemed to me that our good ancestors were strangely silent on one important matter. Life on the brigantines was unadulterated hell, granted. But life went on. Oh, yes indeed, it went on. In fact, aided by the superb libraries resident in Honolulu, I have assembled certain statistics about just how fast life did go on. Take, for example, the brig Thetis, on which some of my ancestors, both on my father’s side and on my mother’s, reached these hospitable shores. The Thetis departed Boston on September 1, 1821 and reached Lahaina on March 26, 1822, after a passage of 207 storm-ridden days.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Applying to these data certain facts which have been established beyond chance of successful, contradiction in Botany 2, any child born to the eleven mission couples prior to May 27, 1822, must have been conceived—in holy wedlock to be sure—on land in New England, and any infant born after December 21, 1822 must by the same reasoning have been conceived on land in Hawaii. But surely, any child born to these particular mission families between May 27 and December 21, 1822, could have been conceived nowhere else but aboard the bouncing brig Thetis. Let us look at what happened to the occupants of one stateroom:</p>

  <p class="normal">Relying upon old records, Bromley Hale proved that of the eleven mission couples aboard the Thetis, nine had produced offspring within the critical period. In turn, he moved to each of the other revered missionary companies, establishing departure and arrival dates, against which he compared the birth records until at last he was able to present a fairly staggering array of statistical evidence. “Good God!” Hoxworth groaned, “if a boy spent half as much ingenuity on something important . . .” But like the rest of Honolulu, he read eagerly on.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does not this amazing fecundity aboard the brigantines suggest rather directly that in the crowded staterooms there must have been one additional occupation whereby the idle time was whiled away, an occupation which our forefathers, through considerations of modesty, did not report to us? I think so.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In what I am now about to discuss, I consider myself far from an expert, but from having hung around poolrooms and from arguments with my betters during football rallies, I think it fairly well established that for a human male to impregnate a human female—and God forbid that he try his tricks on any other—requires on the average not one act of intercourse but at least four. As I understand it, that is the normal experience of the human race, popular novels and sentimental movies that rely upon lucky coincidence notwithstanding. Therefore, it can be seen that for the nine pregnancies achieved aboard the Thetis . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth slumped in his chair. “This boy has a diseased mind,” he groaned. “Now he’s getting clinical!” Hoxworth was right: young Bromley had produced all sorts of hilarious statistical tables and at one point had fortified them with resounding rhetoric: “I think I may be allowed the privilege of at least taking into consideration the theories lately advanced by His Holiness in the Vatican, which theories establish beyond much doubt the fact that for the human female there is a period which the ecclesiastics designate as ‘safe,’ and although it is naturally repugnant for me, a Congregationalist, to rely upon the word of a Catholic dignitary in discussing the secret lives of a gang of Calvinists, and although the nicety of the situation is not lost upon me, nevertheless . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">The phone rang, the first of many calls that were to be made that night. It was Hewlett Janders and he was screaming, “Did you see that goddamned photograph that your goddamned son had of my daughter . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t roar, Hewlett! I just got the wretched thing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you finished it yet,&#160; Hoxworth?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, I’m only on page five.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you haven’t got to the part yet where he says, and listen, Hoxworth, I’m quoting your son. He adds up the total number of acts of sexual intercourse . . . Goddamn it, Hoxworth, what kind of monster have you reared?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, after a dozen similar interruptions, Hoxworth reached his son’s first conclusion: “So if we consider all these facts, which I hold to be statistically incontrovertible, we find that the brig Thetis, for sure, and all the other missionary ships probably, were not the angelic torture barges we have been taught, but—and I use the phrase literally—floating hells of concupiscence.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No wonder they’ve been phoning,” Hoxworth moaned. But his cup was far from running over, it had, in fact, reached not much over the sugar line in the bottom, for in succeeding pages Bromley discussed the heart of his investigations and shared his findings.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What has always intrigued the scientific mind regarding the mission ships is the cramped nature of the staterooms. Again and again we have evidence that four men and four women, most of them married less than a week before entering the ship, and all of them total strangers, lived together in what could best be termed a rabbit warren. We know from incontrovertible testimony that months went by without either husband or wife ever removing his long red-flannel underwear, and we know that the heads of one couple had to be less than two feet from the heads of three other couples, with only a flimsy cloth barrier separating one family from another. Furthermore, as the following picture amply proves, an average-sized man could not stretch out full length . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">In anguish Hoxworth Hale turned to the picture, and his suspicion was correct. The average man whose knees were plainly doubled up was he, caught with a silly look on his face by young Whip Janders and his Leica.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mercifully, the phone rang before he could digest the full ridiculousness of his situation. It was the headmaster at Punahou: “I suppose you’ve seen it, Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How could such a thing have happened, Larry?” Hale groaned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can never probe the minds of adolescents,” the headmaster confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does it seem as bad to you as it does to me?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I haven’t the time to judge degrees, Hoxworth. You realize, I’m sure, that this means . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s got to go, Larry. I realize that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank you, Hoxworth. The important thing is, he’s got to get into Yale. I’ve taken the liberty of dispatching a cable to my old friend Callinson at The Hill. There’s a chance they’ll take him. “I’ve helped Callinson in the past.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You think he can still make Yale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We won’t condemn the boy in our report, Hoxworth. Of that you can be sure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I appreciate this, Larry. But tell me, does this essay indicate a diseased mind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a pause, and the headmaster said reflectively, “I think we’d better leave it the way I said first. About adolescents, we can never know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know where Bromley is?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Hoxworth, I don’t.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The call ended and Hale sat in the lowering darkness. The phone immediately resumed jangling but Hoxworth let it ring. It would be some parent raising hell about what Bromley had said regarding their ancestors. “Damn them all!” Hoxworth cried in real confusion as he watched the lights of Honolulu come on, that nightly miracle that pleased him so much. His family had brought electricity to the city, just as they had brought so much more, but now that a Hale was in trouble, the vultures would want to rip him apart. Therefore, when the front doorbell rang insistently, Hoxworth was inclined to let it ring; he would not parade his hurt to the vultures. Let them pick the bones to their own ghoulish cackling.</p>

  <p class="normal">The door opened and a cheery male voice cried, “Hey! Anybody in?” Hoxworth could hear footsteps crossing the first big room and he had a panicky thought: “It’s some cheeky reporter!” And he started to run for it, when the voice called, “Hey, Mr. Hale. You’re the one . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who are you?” Hoxworth asked stiffly, turning unwillingly to see a brash-looking young man in flannel trousers and white linen coat. He carried three books under his arm, and looked disarmingly at ease.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m Red Kenderdine. Brom’s English teacher.” He looked at a chair, and when Hale failed to respond, asked, “Mind if I sit down?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t want to talk about this thing, Mr. Kenderdine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you seen Brom yet?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Hale snapped. “Where is he?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good. I wanted very much to be the first to talk with you, Mr. Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t want you to make a serious mistake, Mr. Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“First, will you agree to honor what I’m about to say as coming from a personal friend . . . and not from a Punahou master?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t even know you,” Hale replied stuffily. He had never liked educators. To him they were a mealy lot.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Bromley does.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale looked at the young man suspiciously. “Are you in any way involved . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Hale, I come here as a friend, not as a conspirator.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Excuse me, Kenderdine. Bromley has spoken well of you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m glad,” the young instructor said coldly. “I’m here to speak well of him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re about the only one in Honolulu . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Exactly. Mr. Hale, have you read Brom’s essay?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All I could stomach.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Apart from the photograph of you, which is unforgivable, did you recognize your son’s essay as a marvelous piece of irony?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Irony! It was plain unadulterated filth. Sewer stuff.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Mr. Hale, it was first-rate compassionate irony. I wish I had the talent your son has.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You wish . . .” Hoxworth sputtered and stared incredulously at his visitor. “You sound like one of the elements we’re trying to control in this community.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kenderdine blew air from his lower lip into his nose and took a patient respite before daring to answer. Then he handed Mr. Hale three books. “These are for you, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do I want with them?” Hoxworth growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They will help you understand the extraordinarily gifted young man, who happens to be your son,” Kenderdine explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never heard of them,” Hale snorted, at which the young master lost his temper slightly and said something he immediately wished he could recall.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suppose you haven’t, sir. They happen to be three of the greatest novels of our time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh,” Hale grunted, missing the sarcasm. “Well, I still never heard of them. What’re they about?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Family histories, Mr. Hale. <ins class="calibre8">A Lost Lady</ins> is a great masterpiece. I wish everyone in Hawaii could read <ins class="calibre8">The Grandmothers</ins> by Glenway Wescott. It would explain so much about Honolulu and Punahou. And this last one should be read by everyone who comes from a large family with many mixed-up ramifications. Kate O’Brien’s <ins class="calibre8">Without My Cloak</ins>. It’s laid in Ireland, but it’s about you and Bromley, Mr. Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You know, Kenderdine, I don’t like you. I don’t like your manner, and I think if the truth were known, Bromley probably got off on the wrong foot largely because of your bad influence. I don’t know what Punahou’s . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Hale, I don’t like you either,” the young instructor said evenly. “I don’t like a man who can read one of the wittiest, most promising bits of writing I’ve ever known a schoolboy to write and not even recognize what his son has accomplished. Mr. Hale, do you know why Hawaii is so dreadfully dull, why it’s such a wasteland of the human intellect? Because nobody speculates about these islands. Nobody ever writes about them. Aren’t you ever perplexed over the fact Nebraskans write fine novels about Nebraska, and people in Mississippi write wonderful things about Mississippi? Why doesn’t anybody ever write about Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There was Stevenson,” Hale protested, adding brightly, “and Jack London!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Complete junk,” Kenderdine snapped disdainfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you mean to sit there and tell me that you teach our children that Jack London…”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What he wrote about Hawaii? Complete junk. What anybody else has written about Hawaii? Complete junk, Mr. Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who are you to judge your betters?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m stating facts. And the biggest fact is that nobody writes about Hawaii because the great families, like yours, don’t encourage their sons and daughters to think…to feel…and certainly not to report. You’ve got a good thing here, and you don’t want any questions asked.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Young man, I’ve heard enough from you,” Hoxworth said stiffly. “I recognize you as a type too dangerous to work with young people. So, as a member of the board at Punahou . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re going to fire me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would be derelict to my duty if I did otherwise, Mr. Kenderdine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young man relaxed insolently in the chair and stared at the lights of Pearl Harbor. “And I would be derelict to my duty as a human being who loves these islands, Mr. Hale, if I failed to tell you that I for one don’t give a good goddamn what you do or when you do it. I’ve watched you try to hold education back. I’ve watched you try to hold labor back. I’ve watched you try to hold the legislature back. There was nothing I could do about those crimes against the larger community. But when you try to hold back a proven talent, your own son, who if he were encouraged could write the book that would illuminate these islands, then I object. I didn’t know anything about your son’s rare and wonderful essay until I saw it. I got my copy late, but I will always treasure it. When he becomes a great man, I’ll treasure it doubly. I detect in it certain of my phrases, and I’m glad he learned at least something from me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re through, Kenderdine! You’re out!” Hale paced back and forth before the big windows, waiting for the insolent young man to leave, but the English teacher lit a cigarette, puffed twice, and slowly rose.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am through, Mr. Hale. But not because of your action. I was through when I came here. Because I won’t tolerate your kind of crap a day longer. I’ve joined the navy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“God help America if the navy takes men like you,” Hale snorted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And when this war comes to Hawaii, Mr. Hale, as it inevitably must, not only will I be gone, but you will be, too. Everything you stand for. The labor you hate is going to organize. The Japanese you despise will begin to vote. And who knows, perhaps even your cozy little deal with the military, whereby you and they run the islands, will be blasted. I’m through for the time being, Mr. Hale. You’re through forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He bowed gravely, jabbed his forefinger three times at the books and winked. But as he left the room he said gently, “I’ve allowed you to fire me, Mr. Hale. Now you do one thing for me. Read the essay again and discover the love your son holds for the missionaries. Only a mind steeped in true love can write irony. The others write satire.” And he was gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Alone, Hoxworth decided to call the police to find where his son was, but he reconsidered. Then Hewlett Janders stormed over, big, robust, full of action and profanity. Hoxworth found the interview rather confusing because Hewlett on reconsideration didn’t want to horsewhip Bromley at all. He thought the essay a damned good bit of skylarking and said it would probably do the mission families as much good as anything that had happened in years.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whole town’s laughing their belly off,” he roared. “I thought that picture of you in the bunk was downright killing, Hoxworth. And what about that paragraph where he sums up: ‘So by projection we can assume . . .’ Where’s your copy, Hoxworth?” He glimpsed the mimeographed publication under a davenport pillow, picked it up and thumbed through it. “By God, Hoxworth, that picture of you in the bunk is about ten thousand votes if you ever decide to run for office. Only thing you’ve ever done proves you’re human. Here’s the part I wanted. ‘So by projection we can estimate that within an area less than six feet by five, during a voyage of 207 days, no less than 197 separate acts of sexual intercourse must have taken place under conditions which prevented any of the female participants from taking off their long flannel underwear or any of the men from stretching out full length in the bunks.’ Now here’s the part I like,” Janders laughed robustly. ” ‘Against its will the mind is driven to haunting suspicions: What actually went on. in those crowded staterooms? What orgies must have transpired? Out of delicate regard for the proprieties I shall not pursue the probabilities, for they are too harrowing to discuss in public, but I recommend that each reader develop this matter logically to its inevitable conclusions: What did go on?’” Big Hewlett Janders slammed the essay against his leg and shouted, “Y’know, Hoxworth, I often used to ask myself that very question. How the hell do you think the old folks did it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How should I know?” Hoxworth pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Damn it all, man, it was you they photographed hunched up in one of the bunks!” Janders roared.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does anyone know where Bromley is?” Hale asked stiffly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure,” Janders laughed. “But don’t change the subject. Don’t you agree that the bit I just read is hilarious? By God, I can see prim Lucinda Whipple turning cartwheels when she reads that. One fellow at the club said your boy Brom must be a genius.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is he?” Hale insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whole gang of them are having chop suey at Asia Kee’s. Every fifteen minutes somebody yells, ‘Author! Author!’ and Brom takes a bow. Then they all sing a dirge somebody made up, ‘Farewell, Punahou!’ I suppose you heard that my boy Whip also got expelled. For taking the pictures. Damned glad Mandy didn’t too. Posing like that with your boy.” But his raucous laughter proved that he wasn’t too concerned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you see them … at the chop suey place?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yeah, I stopped by … Well, hell, I figured, it’s their big night, so I dropped off a couple bottles of Scotch.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You gave these outrageous children . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I stopped by to see you about, Hoxworth, is that I just called that tutoring school near Lawrenceville, and they’ve agreed to take Whip and Brom … if you want to send them . . . and guarantee to get them into Yale. That’s the only problem, really, Hoxworth. Get the boys into Yale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What school are you talking about?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s the name? It’s right near Lawrenceville. Mark Hewlett sent his boy there when he got busted out of Punahou. They got him into Yale.” Seeing the three novels on the low table, Janders picked one up in the way men do who never read books, and asked, “You drowning your sorrows in a good book?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know an English master at Punahou named Kenderdine?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Crew-cut job.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I had a fearful scene with him. He’s at the root of this business, I’m convinced.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s a troublemaker. Some jerkwater college like Wisconsin or Wesleyan. I keep telling Larry, ‘Get Yale men. They may not be so smart but in the long run they give you less trouble.’ But Larry always drags in some genius . . . Yes, Kenderdine’s Wisconsin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s no longer Punahou.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You fire him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I certainly did. But you know, Hewlett, he said about the same thing you did. Said Bromley’s essay would do us all a lot of good. Get people laughing. He said it was crystal-clear that Brom wrote the essay with love and affection . . . that he wasn’t lampooning the missionaries.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what one of the judges at the club thought,” Janders recalled. “But I’ll tell you what, Hoxworth. Seems it was my son who took the photo of you in the bunk, proving that sex was impossible. Well, if you can handle him, you’re welcome to thrash hell out of him. I won’t try because he can lick me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The door banged and Hoxworth Hale was left alone in the big room overlooking Honolulu. For a while he studied the never tedious pattern of lights, as they came and went along the foreshores of the bay, and the bustling activity at Pearl Harbor, and the starry sky to the south: his city, the city of his people, the fruit of his family’s energy. He leafed his son’s startling essay and saw again the provocative last sentence: “We can therefore conclude, I think, that whereas our fathers often paced the deck of the Thetis, wrestling with their consciences, they usually wound up by hustling below to the cramped bunks, where they wrestled with their wives.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Idly he picked up the three books Kenderdine had left. Hefting the Irish novel, he found it too heavy and put it aside. He looked at Willa Cather’s slim book, <ins class="calibre8">A Lost Lady</ins>, but its title seemed much too close to his own case, and he did not want to read about lovely ladies who become lost, for it seemed to be happening throughout his group. That left <ins class="calibre8">The Grandmothers</ins>, which was neither too heavy in bulk nor too close to home, although had he known when he started reading, it was really the most dangerous of the three, for it was a barbed shaft directed right at the heart of Honolulu and its wonderful matriarchies.</p>

  <p class="normal">To his surprise, he was still reading the story of Wisconsin’s rare old women, when the lights of Honolulu sadly surrendered their battle against the rising dawn. The door creaked open gingerly, and Bromley Whipple Hale, flushed with pride of authorship and Uncle Hewlett’s good whiskey, stumbled into the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hi, Dad.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hello, Bromley.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The handsome young fellow, with indelible Whipple charm stamped on his bright features, slumped into a chair and groaned. “It’s been quite a day, Dad.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Grudgingly, Hoxworth observed: “You seem to have cut quite a niche for yourself in the local mausoleum.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dad, I got thrown out of school.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know. Uncle Hewlett’s already made plans for you and Whipple to get into one of the good cram schools. The one thing you have to safeguard is your Yale entrance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dad, I was going to speak about this later, but I guess now’s … I don’t believe I want to go to Yale. Now wait a minute! I’d like to try either Alabama or Cornell.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Alabama! Cornell!” Hoxworth exploded. “Those jerkwater . . . Good heavens, you might just as well go to the University of Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what I wanted to do … seeing as how I want to write about Hawaii. But Mr. Kenderdine says that Alabama and Cornell have fine classes in creative writing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bromley, where did you ever get the idea that you want to be a writer? This isn’t a job for a man. I’ve been relying on you to . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll have to rely upon somebody else, Dad. There’s lots of good bright young men from Harvard and Penn business schools who’d be glad . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you know about Harvard and Penn?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Kenderdine told us they were the best in the country . .. in business.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth stiffened and growled, “I suppose your Mr. Kenderdine said that anyone who bothered to go into business . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no! He thinks business is the modern ocean for contemporary Francis Drakes and Jean Lafittes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Weren’t they pirates?” Hoxworth asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They were adventurers. Mr. Kenderdine told Whip Janders he ought to try like the devil to get into Harvard Business School.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But he didn’t tell you that, did he?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Dad. He thinks I can write.” There was a long pause in the big room as the pastel lights of morning spread across the city below, and one of those rare moments developed in which a son can talk to his father, and if Hoxworth Hale had growled in his customary manner, the moment would have passed, like the ghost of Pele ignoring one whom she considered not worth a warning, but Hoxworth’s personal god sat heavily on his shoulder, and he said nothing, so that his son continued: “You and your father and all your generations used to sit up here, Dad, and look down at Honolulu and dream of controlling it. Every streetcar that ran, every boat that came to port did so at your command. I appreciate that. It’s a noble drive, a civilizing one. Sometimes I’ve caught a glimpse of such a life for myself. But it’s always passed, Dad. I just don’t have that vision, and you’ve got to find someone who has, or you and I will both go broke.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you have any vision at all?” Hoxworth asked quietly, back in the shadows.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, yes!” The handsome young fellow pointed to Honolulu, lying tribute beneath them, and confided for the first time to anyone: “I want to control this city too, Dad. But I want to bore into its heart to see what makes it run. Why the Chinese buy land and the Japanese don’t. Why the old families like ours intermarry and intermarry until damned near half of them have somebody locked away in upstairs rooms. I want to know who really owns the waterfront, and what indignities a man must suffer before he can become an admiral at Pearl Harbor. And when I know all these things, I’m going to write a book . . . maybe lots of them . . . and they won’t be books like the ones you read. They’ll be like <ins class="calibre8">The Grandmothers</ins> and <ins class="calibre8">Without My Cloak</ins>, books you never heard of. And when I know, and when I have written what I know, then I’ll control Honolulu in a manner you never dreamed of. Because I’ll control its imagination.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was slightly drunk and fell back in his chair. His father watched him for some minutes, during which fragments of The Grandmothers repeated themselves in Hoxworth’s agitated mind. Finally the father said, “I suppose you don’t want to bundle off to the cram school?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Dad.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What will you do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s no sweat getting into either Cornell or Alabama. I’ll register Monday at McKinley High.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth winced and asked, “Why McKinley?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The kids call it Manila Prep and I’d sort of like to know some Filipinos.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You already know . . . Doesn’t Consul Adujo’s son go to Punahou?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to know real Filipinos, Dad.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth Hale started to rear back, as if he were about to tell his son that he would tolerate no nonsense about McKinley High School, but as words began to formulate he saw his son etched against the pale morning light, and the silhouette was not of Bromley Hoxworth, the radical essayist who had outraged Hawaii, but of Hoxworth Hale, the radical art critic who had charged Yale University with thievery; and a bond of identity was established, and the father swallowed his words of reprimand.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell me one thing, Bromley. This Mr. Kenderdine? Can his ideas be trusted?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The best, Dad. Unemotional, yet loaded with fire. You heard, I suppose, that we’re losing him. Joining the navy. Says there’s bound to be war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a painful silence and the boy concluded: “Maybe that’s why I want to go to McKinley now, Dad. There mayn’t be too much time.” He started to bed but realized that he owed his father some kind of apology, for the mimeographed essay had created a storm which he, the author, had not anticipated. “About that photograph of you, Dad . . . What I mean is, if I do become a writer, I’ll be a good one.” And he stumbled off to bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1941 the Thanksgiving Day football game was largely a replay of the 1938 classic, with Punahou pitted against McKinley, but this time two Sakagawa boys played for Punahou; for Hoxworth Hale and his committee of alumni had been so pleased with Tadao’s performance that they had automatically extended scholarships to the younger boys, Minoru the tackle and Shigeo the halfback. Thus it was -that the former privy cleaner Kamejiro sat in the stadium along with his wife and his two older boys--Goro was in army uniform-- cheering for Punahou. A newspaperman remarked: “It’s a revolution in Hawaii when Sakagawa the barber and Hoxworth Hale support the same team.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Throughout Hawaii these minor miracles of accommodation were taking place. When a child felt pain he said, “Itai, itai!” which was Japanese. When he finished work it was pauhana. He had aloha for his friends. He tried to avoid pilikia and when he flattered girls it was hoomalimali, all Hawaiian words. He rarely ate candy, but kept his pockets filled with seed, a delicious Chinese confection tasting like ice, sugar and salt all at once and made of dried cherries or plums. After a dance he did not eat hot dogs; he ate a bowl of saimin, Japanese noodles, with teriyaki barbecue. Or he had chop suey. For dessert he had a Portuguese malasada, a sweet, sticky fried doughnut, crackling with sugar. It was an island community and it had absorbed the best from many cultures. On this day, as Punahou battled McKinley in a game that was more thrilling to Honolulu than the Rose Bowl game was to California, Punahou, the haole heaven, fielded a team containing two Sakagawas, a Kee, two Kalanianaoles, a Rodriques and assorted Hales, Hewletts, Janderses and Hoxworths. That year Punahou won, 27-6, and Shigeo Sakagawa scored two of the touchdowns, so that as he went home through the streets of Kakaako the perpetual toughs taunted him contemptuously with being a haole-lover, but they no longer tried to assault the Sakagawa boys. They knew better.</p>

  <p class="normal">Logically, the Sakagawas should have been able—what with the aid of scholarships for three of the boys—to retire Reiko-chan from the barbershop, allowing her to enroll in the university, but just as the family had enough money saved ahead for this, the consulate on Nuuanu Street convened the Japanese community and told them gravely, “The war in China grows more costly than ever. We have got to assist our homeland now. Please, please remember your vows to the emperor.” And the fund had gone to help Japan resist the evil of China’s aggression, though Goro asked his friends, “How can China be the aggressor when it’s Japan that’s done the invading?” He wanted to ask his father about this, but Kamejiro, in these trying days of late 1941, had pressing problems which he could not share with his children, nor with anyone else for that matter, except Mr. Ishii.</p>

  <p class="normal">They began when Hawaii established a committee of American citizens whose job it was to visit all Japanese homes, beseeching the parents to write to Japan to have the names of their children removed from village registers, thus canceling their Japanese citizenship. Hoxworth Hale was the committee member who visited the Sakagawas, and with Reiko as interpreter he explained on the day after Thanksgiving: “Mr. Sakagawa, Japan is a nation that insists upon dual citizenship. But since your five fine children were born here, legally they’re Americans. Emotionally they’re Americans too. But because you registered their names in your Hiroshima village years ago they are also Japanese citizens. Suppose the war in Europe spreads. What if Japan and America get into it on opposite sides? Your sons might face serious difficulties if you allow them to retain two citizenships. To protect them, get it cleaned up.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The five children added their pleas. “Look, Pop,” they argued. “We respect Japan;, but we’re going to be Americans.” Their father agreed with them. He nodded. He told Mr. Hale that it ought to be done, but as always before, he refused to sign any papers. This the children could not understand and they sided with Mr. Hale when he said, “It really isn’t right, Mr. Sakagawa, for you to penalize your sons, especially with three of them being Punahou boys.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Sakagawa-san was adamant, and after Mr. Hale had left, and his family began hammering him with their arguments, he felt caged and finally kicked a chair and shouted, “I’m going away where a man can get some peace.” He sought out Mr. Ishii and sat glumly with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our evil has caught up with us, old friend,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was bound to, sooner or later,” Mr. Ishii reflected sadly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The children are insisting that I write to Hiroshima and take their names off the village registry.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You aren’t going to do it, are you?” Mr. Ishii asked hopefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can I? And bring disgrace upon us all?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two men, now gray in their late fifties, sat moodily and thought of the shame in which they were involved. In their village Kamejiro had been legally married by proxy to the pretty girl Sumiko, by whom he had had five children, all duly reported; and Mr. Ishii had been legally married to Miro Yonko, no children reported. Yet by convenient switching, Kamejiro had married Yoriko, American style, and she was the mother of the children; Mr. Ishii had likewise married Sumiko, and she had turned out to be a prostitute. How could they explain these things to the Japanese consulate on Nuuanu Street? How could they explain this accidental bigamy to the five children? Above all, how could they explain it to the village authorities in Hiroshima? “All Japan would be ashamed,” Mr. Ishii said gloomily. “Kamejiro, we better leave things just as they are.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the children are fighting with me. Today even Mr. Hale came to the house. He had the papers in his hands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course he had the papers!” Mr. Ishii agreed. “But you watch his face when you try to explain who your wife is. Kamejiro, friend, let the matter drop.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But on Saturday, December 6, Mr. Hale returned to tie shack and said, “You are the last holdout on my list, Mr. Sakagawa. Please end your sons’ dual citizenship. With Goro here in the army, and Tadao and Minoru in the R.O.T.C., it’s something you’ve got to do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t,” Kamejiro said through his interpreter, Goro, who had a weekend pass from Schofield Barracks.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t understand the old man,” Goro said, smoothing out his army uniform, of which he was obviously proud. “He’s loyal to Japan, but he’s no great flag waver. I’ll argue with him again when you’re gone, Mr. Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“His obstinacy looks very bad,” Mr. Hale warned. “Especially with you in the army. I’ve got to report it, of course.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro shrugged his shoulders. “Have you ever tried to argue with a Japanese papa-san? My pop has some crazy fixed idea. But I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That Saturday night the entire Sakagawa family battled out this problem of dual citizenship, in Japanese. “I respect your country, Pop,” Goro said. “I remember when I had the fight with the priest about going back to Japan. When I finally surrendered, I really intended to go. But you know what’s happened, Pop. Football . . . now the army. Let’s face it, Pop. I’m an American.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Me too,” Tadao agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The sons hammered at him, and finally he said, “I want you to be Americans. When I put a newspaper picture like that over the sink, ‘Four Sakagawa Stars,’ don’t you think I’m proud? Long ago I admitted you’d never again be Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then take our names off the citizenship registry in Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t,” he repeated for the fiftieth time.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Damn it, Pop, sometimes you make me mad!” Goro cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro stood up. He stared at his sons and said, “There will be no shouting. Remember that you are decent Japanese sons.” They came to attention, and he added sorrowfully, “There is a good reason why I cannot change the register.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But why?” the boys insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Through the long night the argument lasted, and stubborn Kamejiro was unable to explain why he was powerless to act; for even though his sons were American, he was forever Japanese, and he expected one day to return to Hiroshima; when he got there he could quietly tell his friends about the mix-up in Hawaii, but he could not do so by letter. He himself could not write, and he could not trust others to write for him. It was two o’clock in the morning when he went to bed, and as he pulled the covers up about his shoulders, on a group of aircraft carriers six hundred miles away, a task force of Japanese airmen, many of them from Hiroshima, prepared to bomb Pearl Harbor.</p>

  <p class="normal">Shigeo, the youngest of the Sakagawas, rose early next morning and pedaled his bicycle down to Cable Wireless, where he worked on Sundays delivering cables that had accumulated during the night and those which would come in throughout the day. His first handful he got at seven-thirty and they were all addressed to people in the Diamond Head area like the Hales and the Whipples, who lived in big houses overlooking the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had reached Waikiki when he heard from the vicinity of Pearl Harbor a series of dull explosions and he thought: “More fleet exercises. Wonder what it means?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned his back on Pearl Harbor and pedaled up an impressive lane leading to the estate of Hoxworth Hale, and while waiting in the porte-cochere he looked back toward the naval base and saw columns of dense black smoke curling up into the morning sunlight. More explosions followed and he saw a series of planes darting and zigzagging through the bright blue overhead. “Pretty impressive,” he thought.</p>

  <p class="normal">He rang the Hale bell again, and in a moment Hoxworth Hale appeared in a dark business suit, wearing collar and tie, as if such a leader of the community were not allowed to relax. Shig noticed that the man’s face was colorless and his hands trembling. The radio was making noises from a room Shig could not see, but what it was saying he could not determine. Gulping in a manner not common to the Hales, Hoxworth pushed open the screen door and said to the star of the Punahou eleven, My God, Shig. Your country has declared war on mine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For a moment Shig could not comprehend what had been said. Pointing back to Pearl Harbor he asked, “They having a make-believe invasion?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Hoxworth Hale replied in a hollow, terrified voice. “Japan is bombing Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Japan?” Shig looked up at the darting planes and saw that where they passed, explosions followed and that as the planes sped toward the mountains, puffs of gunfire traced them through the sky. “Oh, my God!” the boy gasped. “What’s happened?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth held the door open, ignoring the cable, and indicated that Shig should come inside, and they went to the radio, whose announcer was repeating frantically, yet with a voice that tried to avoid the creation of panic: “I repeat. This is not a military exercise. Japanese planes are bombing Honolulu. I repeat. This is not a joke. This is war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth Hale covered his face with his hands and muttered, “How awful this is going to be.” Looking at bright-eyed Shig, who was only a year older than his own son, he said, You’ll need all the courage you have, son.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shig replied, “Outside you said, ‘Your country has declared war on my country.’ Yours and mine are both the same, Mr. Hale. I’m an American.’</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sorry, Shig. That’s a mistake many of us will make in the next few days. God, look at that explosion!” The two watchers winced as an enormous thunder filled the air, accompanied by a slowly rising pillar of jet-black smoke that billowed and twisted upward from the ruins at Pearl Harbor. “Something terrible is taking place,” Hale mumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then from a stairway behind him came a haunted voice, weak and piping like a child’s, and he made as if to push Shigeo out the door, but before he could do so the person on the stairs had come down into the room and stood facing her husband and his visitor. It was Mrs. Hale, a frail and very beautiful woman of thirty-eight. She had light auburn hair and wide, level eyes that found difficulty in focusing. She wore a wispy dressing gown such as Shig had never seen before outside the movies, and she walked haltingly. “What is the great noise I hear, Hoxworth?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama, you shouldn’t have come down here,” her husband admonished.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I heard a shooting,” she explained softly, “and I wondered if you were in trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment one of the bombing planes was driven off course by a burst of unexpected anti-aircraft fire, and it swerved from its planned escape route, winging swiftly over the Diamond Head area, and as it passed, Shig and Mr. Hale could see on its underbelly the red circle of Japan. “You’d better go now,” Mr. Hale said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You haven’t signed for the cable,” Shig pointed out, and as Hoxworth took the cable and signed the receipt, his wife walked ghostlike to the door and looked toward Pearl Harbor, where the bombs were still exploding.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ahhhhhh!” she shrieked in a weird guttural cry. “It’s war and my son will be killed.” Throwing her filmy sleeves over her face, she ran to her husband, sobbing, “It’s war, and Bromley will not come back alive.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale, holding his wife in his right arm, returned the receipt with his left hand and gripped Shigeo by the shoulder. “You must not speak of this,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I won’t,” Shigeo promised, not understanding exactly what it was that he was expected to keep secret.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro had risen at six that morning and had gone down to the barbershop to sterilize everything again, for part of the success of his shop stemmed from his mania for cleanliness. Now he was back home waiting for his breakfast. His wife Yoriko, who never did her customers’ laundry on Sunday, was leisurely preparing a meal, having already fed Shigeo. Goro, enjoying his pass, was sleeping late, but Tadao, who was in the R.O.T.C. at the university, had already risen. Reiko-chan was dressed and ready to go to an early service at the Community Church in Moih’ili. Minoru, nineteen and already in training for basketball at Punahou, was also sleeping.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first to comprehend what was happening was Goro, for when the bombs struck he thundered out of bed, ran in his shorts into the yard and shouted, “This is no game. Somebody’s declared war!” He ran to the radio he had built for the family and heard official confirmation of his suspicions: “Enemy planes of unknown origin are bombing Pearl Harbor and Hickam Field.” Turning to his family he announced in Japanese: “I think Japan has declared war against us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The escape route used by those bombers who attacked the eastern segment of Pearl Harbor carried them across Kakaako, and now as they flashed by in triumph the Sakagawa family gathered on their minute lawn surrounded by flowers and watched the bright red rising sun of Japan dart by. As soon as the enemy was identified Goro shouted, “Tad! We better report right away!” Accordingly, he hurried into his army uniform and hitchhiked a ride out to Schofield Barracks, while Tadao and Minoru climbed into their R.O.T.C. uniforms, Tadao reporting to the university and Minoru to Punahou. But before the boys left, they bowed ceremoniously to their bewildered father.</p>

  <p class="normal">The impact of these sudden happenings on Kamejiro staggered him. In an uncomprehending daze he sat down on the steps of his shack and stared at the sky, where puffs of ack-ack traced the departure of the Japanese planes. Three times he saw the red sun of his homeland flash past, and once he saw the evil snout of a low-flying Japanese fighter spewing machine-gun bullets ineffectively into the bay. He tried to focus his thoughts on what was happening and upon his sons’ prompt departure for the American army; but the inchoate thoughts that were rising in his mind were not allowed to become words. Japan must have been in great trouble to have done such a thing. The boys must have been in great trouble if they left so promptly to defend America. That was as far as he could go.</p>

  <p class="normal">At eleven o’clock that Sunday morning a group of four secret police, armed and with a black hearse waiting on Kakaako Street, rushed into the Sakagawa home and arrested Kamejiro. “Sakagawa,” said one who spoke Japanese. “We’ve been watching you for a long time. You’re a dynamiter, and you’re to go into a concentration camp.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait!” Reiko protested. “You know who the Sakagawa boys are. At Punahou. What’s this about concentration camp?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s a dynamiter, Miss Sakagawa. He gave money to Japan. And he refused to denationalize you. It’s the pokey for him.” The efficient team whisked. bewildered Kamejiro into the hearse and it drove on, picking up other suspected seditionists.</p>

  <p class="normal">At eleven-thirty Shigeo pedaled by on his Cable Wireless bicycle to share with the family the frightening things he had been seeing, but he said nothing of them, for Reiko’s announcement that their father had been hauled away to concentration camp stunned him. This was really war, and he and all other Japanese were instantly involved. “Pop couldn’t have been doing anything wrong, could he?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The brother and sister looked at each other and it was Shigeo who formulated their doubt: “On the other hand, Pop used to prowl around every night.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shigeo!” Reiko-chan cried. “That’s unworthy!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m only trying to think like the F.B.I., Shig explained in justification.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were further disturbed when Mr. Ishii, in a state of maximum excitement, ran up with this startling news: “The Japanese army is making a landing at the other end of the island. They’ve already captured Maui and Kauai.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s impossible!” Shigeo cried. “I’ve been all over Honolulu this morning, and I heard nothing like that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll see!” the quick little man assured them. “By tomorrow night Japan will be in complete control.” To the amazement of the Sakagawa children, Mr. Ishii seemed positively exhilarated by the prospect, and Shigeo caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You be careful what you’re saying, Mr. Ishii! The F.B.I. just arrested Pop.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When the Japanese win he’ll be a hero,” the little man exulted. “Now everyone who laughs at Japanese will behave themselves. You watch what happens when the troops march into Honolulu.” He waved a warning finger at them and dashed on down the street.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think he’s out of his mind,” Shigeo said sadly as he watched the community gossip disappear. As Mr. Ishii turned the corner, a patrol came through Kakaako, announcing with a loud-speaker: “All Japanese are under house arrest. Do not leave your homes. I repeat. Do not leave your homes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Shigeo went up to them and said, “I’m the Sunday delivery boy for Cable Wireless!</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a moment of hesitation, after which the patrol made the type of decision that was going to be made many times that day throughout Hawaii: the Japanese are all spies and they are all disloyal; they must be clamped into house arrest; but we know this particular Japanese and the work he is doing is essential, therefore he is excused. The patrol looked at Shig’s bicycle with its clear marking, and one man asked, “Aren’t you the kid who plays for Punahou?” “Yes,” Slug replied. “You’re all right. You go ahead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You got a pass I could use?” Shig asked. “I don’t want to get shot at.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure. Use this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At two o’clock that afternoon Shig reported to his main office for his fourth batch of telegrams and he was handed one addressed to General Lansing Hommer, but since Shig knew that the general lived at the extreme end of his route, he tucked that particular message into the bottom of his pile and as he pedaled through the western part of Honolulu toward Pearl Harbor and saw the devastation he understood better than most what had happened and what was about to happen. From the porch of one house where he delivered a cable, he could see the anchorage at Pearl Harbor itself, and alongside the piers he saw the stricken ships, lying on their sides and belching flames.</p>

  <p class="normal">The man to whom he had given the telegram said, “Well, the goddamned Japs hit everything they aimed&#160; at.&#160; Papers said&#160; Japs couldn’t fly planes because they were cross-eyed. You ask me, we better get some cross-eyed pilots. And some ‘gunners, too. I stood on this porch for three hours and I didn’t see our men hit one goddamned Jap plane. What do you think of that?” “You mean they all got away?” “Every one of the bastards.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Some monkey was telling me the Japanese have already landed,” Shig said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’ll never make it,” the man replied. “So far the Japs have hit only the navy, which is a bunch of do-nothings anyway. When they try to land they run up against the dogfaces. That’ll be different. I got two sons in the infantry. Plenty tough. You got anyone in uniform?” “Two brothers.” “Infantry, I hope?” “Yep. They’re plenty tough, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think the yellow bastards’ll make it,” the man said as he ripped open his telegram.</p>

  <p class="normal">At four thirty-one that hot, terrifying afternoon Shigeo Sakagawa reached the end of his route, and he pedaled his Cable Wireless bicycle up the long drive leading to the residence of General Hommer, where the ashen-faced military leader took the cable and scribbled his name in pencil across the receipt. His command had been virtually destroyed. The islands he was supposed to protect were at the mercy of the enemy. Even his own headquarters had been strafed with impunity. At the end of this debacle he was forced to receive cables from Washington, but this particular one was more than he could stomach. He read it, swore, crumpled it up, and threw it on the floor. As it slowly unfolded itself, Shig could read that it came from the War Department. It warned General Hommer that from secret sources Washington had concluded that Japan might attempt to attack Pearl Harbor. With all the instantaneous systems of communications available to the government, Washington could have rushed the message through in time to prevent the holocaust, but it had transmitted this most urgent of contemporary cables by ordinary commercial wireless. It arrived tea hours late, delivered on bicycle by a Japanese messenger boy.</p>

  <p class="normal">The speed with which Goro and Tadao rushed to offer their services to America was not matched by America in accepting those services. The 298th Infantry Regiment, which Goro joined at Schofield Barracks, was composed mostly of Japanese enlisted men commanded by non-Japanese officers, and it was this unit which was dispatched to clean up the bomb damage at Hickam Field, where dozens of American aircraft had been destroyed by Japanese bombers. When the air corps men saw the truckload of local Japanese boys invading the wrecked air strip they yelled, “They’re invading!” And some frightened guards started shooting.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Knock it off!” the 298th shouted. “We’re Americans!” and in the next three days of crisis the outfit put forth a remarkable effort, working eighteen and twenty hours a day to make the airfield operable. “Best crew on the island,” one haole superior reported admiringly. “Not much question as to where their loyalty rests.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But on the night of December 10 somebody in Honolulu headquarters received a message from California pointing out how energetic California was in rounding up its criminal Japanese, and some senior officer pushed the panic button. So in the silent hours before dawn three companies of trustworthy haole soldiers were sent with an extra complement of machine guns to perform one of the war’s most curious tasks, and when dawn broke, Goro Sakagawa was the first Japanese boy in the 298th to look out of his tent and cry, “Christ! We’re surrounded!”</p>

  <p class="normal">His mates tumbled out of their sacks and started to rush onto the parade ground when a stern voice, coming over an impersonal metallic loud-speaker commanded: “You Japanese soldiers! Listen to me. Stay right where you are. Don’t make one false move. You’re surrounded by guns. Stay where you are!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then a different voice cried: “You Japanese soldiers. I want you to nominate one man from each tent to step outside. Quick!”</p>

  <p class="normal">From his tent Goro stepped into the gathering light, wearing shorts and nothing more. Then the voice continued: “You Japanese soldiers inside the tents. Pass out your rifles, your revolvers, your grenades. Quick! You men outside, stack them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When this was done the voice commanded: “If there are any non-Japanese soldiers in this encampment, they are to leave now. You have five minutes. Quick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Friends, unable to look their Japanese partners in the eye, shuffled away, and when the five minutes were gone, only Japanese boys stood bewildered in the tents. “Does this mean prison camp?” one whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who knows?” his mate shrugged.</p>

  <p class="normal">What it meant the Japanese boys were now to discover. “Muster out here!” the tinny voice commanded. “As you are! As you are!” And when the bewildered troops were in line, the colonel who had spoken first advised them: “You have been disarmed as a precautionary measure. We cannot tell when your countrymen will try to attack us again and we cannot endanger our rear by having you carrying weapons among us. You will stay within this barbed-wire enclosure until you get further orders. My men have been given one simple command: If any Jap steps outside this compound, shoot!”</p>

  <p class="normal">For three humiliating days, burdened with rumor and fear, the Japanese boys of the 298th looked out into machine-gun muzzles. Then their guard was relaxed and they were told, “You will be free to work on latrine duty, or paring potatoes, or picking up. But you’ll never touch guns again. Now snap to.” That took care of Goro, who went into permanent latrine duty.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Tadao left home on December 7 he ran all the way to the university, where his unit of the R.O.T.C. had already formed up with men who lived in the dormitories, and he arrived breathless just in time to march with his outfit to repel a Japanese parachute landing that was reported to have taken place north of Diamond Head. Of course, no enemy had landed, but headquarters forgot to inform the R.O.T.C. of this, and the Japanese boys patrolled their areas for four days without relief. Japanese families in the area supplied them with rice balls into which salty pickled plums had been inserted, and the college boys kept to their lonely posts.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was on this silent duty that Tadao Sakagawa thought out explicitly what he would do if Japanese Imperial soldiers came over the rise at him. “I’d shoot,” he said simply. “They’d be the enemy and I’d shoot.” At the water reservoir, Minoru Sakagawa, of the Punahou R.O.T.C., reached the same conclusion: “I’d shoot.” Across Hawaii in those angry, aching days some fourteen thousand young Japanese Americans of military age fought out with themselves this same difficult question, and all came up with the same answer: “They’re obviously the enemy, so obviously I’d shoot.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, after several weeks of distinguished duty, all Japanese boys in the R.O.T.C. were quietly told, “We no longer have any place for you in the outfit. Turn in your uniforms.” They were given no reason, no alternative, so Tadao and Minoru turned in their hard-earned American uniforms and appeared next day in mufti. A haole soldier from Arkansas saw them walking along the street and jeered: “Why ain’t you yellow-bellied bastards in uniform same as me? Why should I fight to protect you slant-eyes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Minoru, being a rather beefy tackle at Punahou, was always ready for a brawl, and he turned toward the Arkansas boy, but Tadao, a quieter type, caught his arm and dragged him along. “If you hit a soldier, they’d lynch you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll take so much,” Minoru muttered, “and then somebody’s going to get it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But they were to find out that day just how much they would be required to take, for as they came down from the R.O.T.C. headquarters, where their pleas for reinstatement were rejected, they saw their mother in her customary black kimono and straw geta walking pin-toed along Kakaako, shuffling in her peasant style and bent forward from the hips. She looked, Minoru had to admit, extremely foreign, and he was not surprised therefore when a crowd gathered and began to shout at her, telling her in words which she couldn’t understand that no slant-eyed Japanese were wanted in the streets of Honolulu with their filthy kimonos. And before the boys could get to their mother, rowdies were actually beginning to tear off her kimono.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why don’t you wear shoes, like decent Americans?” the rowdies cried. They hectored her into a corner, without her understanding at all what was happening, and a big man kept kicking at the offensive zori. “Take ‘em off, goddamn it. Take ‘em off!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Swiftly Minoru and Tadao leaped among the crowd to protect their mother, and some sports fans recognized them and shouted, “It’s the Sakagawa boys.” The incident ended without further embarrassment, but Tadao, who was a diplomat, whispered to his terrified mother, “Kick off your zori. That’s what made them mad.” Deftly she kicked away the Japanese shoes, and the crowd cheered. On the way home Tadao warned her, “You’ve got to stop coming out in public wearing your kimono.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And buy some shoes!” Minoru snapped, for like all the boys of his age, he could not understand why his parents kept to their old ways.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the following days Minoru and Tadao were to be repeatedly tested. Having been born in America, they were technically citizens and even eligible to become President; but they were also Japanese and were thus subjected to humiliations worse than those suffered by aliens. Several times they were threatened by drunken soldiers, and prudence told them to keep off the streets.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, animosity against all Japanese increased when Hawaii, staggered by the completeness with which Japan had defeated the local troops, understandably turned to any logical rationalization at hand “You can’t tell me the Japs could have bombed our ships unless the local slant-eyes were feeding them spy information,” one man shouted in a bar.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know for a fact that plantation workers at Malama Sugar cut arrows across the cane fields, showing Nip fliers the way to Pearl Harbor,” a luna reported.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The F.B.I, has proved that almost every Jap maid working for the military was a paid agent of the Mikado,” an official announced.</p>

  <p class="normal">And the Secretary of the Navy himself, after inspecting the disaster, told the press frankly, “Hawaii was the victim of the most effective fifth-column work that has come out of this war, except in Norway.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was therefore no wonder that many Japanese were arrested and thrown into hastily improvised jails, whereupon those not yet picked up were ready to believe the rumor that all Japanese in Hawaii were to be evacuated to tents on Molokai. But when the jails were jammed and ships actually appeared in the harbor to haul those already arrested to concentration camps in Nevada, an unusual thing happened, one which more than any other served to bind up the wounds caused by the attack on Pearl Harbor. Hoxworth Hale and Mrs. Hewlett Janders and Mrs. John Whipple Hoxworth and a maiden librarian named Luanda Whipple went singly, and not as a result of concerted action, to the jails where the Japanese were being held. Being the leading citizens of the community, they were admitted, and as they walked through the corridors they said to the jailers, “I know that man well. He can’t possibly be a spy. Let him go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Hewlett Janders even went so far as to bring her husband, big Hewie, to the jail in his naval uniform, and he identified half a dozen excellent citizens whom he had known for years. “It’s ridiculous to keep those men in a concentration camp. They’re as good Americans as I am.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you vouch for them if we let them go?” the F.B.I, man asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Me vouch for Ichiro Ogawa? I’d be proud to vouch for him. You come out of there, Ichiro. Go back to work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Some three hundred leading Japanese citizens were removed from jail by these voluntary efforts of the missionary descendants. It wasn’t that they liked Japanese, or that they feared Imperial Japan less than their neighbors. It was just that as Christians they could not sit idly by and watch innocent people maltreated. In California, where the imaginary danger of trouble from potential fifth columnists was not a fraction of the real danger that could have existed in Hawaii, cruel and senseless measures were taken that would be forever an embarrassment to America: families of the greatest rectitude and patriotism were uprooted; their personal goods were stolen; their privacy was abused; and their pride as full-fledged American citizens outraged. Such things did not happen in Hawaii. Men like Hoxworth Hale and Hewlett Janders wouldn’t allow them to happen; women like Miss Whipple and Mrs. Hoxworth personally went through the jails to protect the innocent.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when Hoxworth Hale came to the cell in which Kamejiro Sakagawa sat, a more intricate moral problem presented itself, for at first Hale was not ready to swear to the F.B.I, men, “This fellow I know to be innocent.” What Hale did know was this: Kamejiro was a known dynamiter who had been in trouble during the strike at Malama Sugar; he had obstinately refused to terminate the Japanese nationality of his children; he had been prowling about all of Honolulu at night some years before Pearl Harbor; and now he was running a barbershop with his own daughter as a lure to bring in sailors and soldiers. That was the debit side. But Hale also knew one other fact: of all the young Japanese boys in Honolulu, none were finer Americans than Kamejiro’s sons. Therefore, instead of passing by the cell, Hale stopped and asked to be allowed to talk with this man Sakagawa. When the cell door was opened and he sat inside with Kamejiro he told the interpreter to ask: “Mr. Sakagawa, why did you refuse to allow me to end your sons’ dual citizenship?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old stubborn light come into Kamejiro’s eyes, but when he realized that if he did not speak the truth he might never again see his sons, he softened and said, “Will you promise never to tell my boys?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Hale said, for he had family problems of his own. He directed the interpreter to promise likewise.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My wife and I are not married,” Kamejiro began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I saw the marriage certificate!” Hale interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“American yes, but it doesn’t count,” Kamejiro explained. “When I sent for a picture bride to Hiroshima-ken, a girl was picked out and she was married to me there, in proper Japanese style, and her name was put in the village book as my wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then what’s the problem?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro blushed at his ancient indiscretion and explained, “So when she got here I didn’t like her, and there was another man who didn’t like his wife, either.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So you swapped?” Hale asked. A smile came across his lips. It seemed rather simple.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. In each country I am married to a different woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But of course this is your real country and this is what counts,” Hale said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Kamejiro patiently corrected. “Japan is my real home, and I would be ashamed for my village to know the wrong thing I have done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale was impressed by the man’s forthright defense of Japan, even in such trying circumstances, and he said condescendingly, “I don’t think it would really matter, at this distance of time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, but it would!” Kamejiro warned. And what he said struck a vibrant chord in Hale’s own memories. “Because the wife I got in the exchange turned out to be the best wife a man ever found. But the wife I gave my friend turned out to be a very bad woman indeed, and his life has been ruined and I have had to sit and watch it happen.</p>

  <p class="normal">My happiness came at his expense, and I will do nothing now to hurt him any further. At least in our village they think he is an honorable man, and I will leave it that way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale clenched his hands and thought of his own reactions to just such problems and of his insistence, against the pressure of friends, that his wife Malama stay with him, even though her mind had wandered past the limits usually required for commitment to an asylum, and in that moment of loving a woman, and knowing apprehension about the fate of one’s son in a time of war, Hale felt a close kinship to the little bow-legged Japanese sitting before him. To the F.B.I, man he said, “This one can surely go free.” And Kamejiro returned to his family.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course, when the gardener Ichiro Ogawa, who had been saved from internment by Hewlett Janders, later insisted that he ought to get a raise from the $1.40 a day that Janders was paying him, big Hewie hit the roof and accused the little Japanese of being unpatriotic by demanding a raise at such a critical time in America’s history. “I think of your welfare all the time, Ichiro,” Hewie explained. “You must leave these things to me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I can’t live on $1.40 a day any more. War expense.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you threatening me?” Janders boomed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I got to have more money,” Ichiro insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">As soon as the Japanese had left, Janders called security at Pearl Harbor. “Lemuel,” he spluttered, “I’ve got a workman out here whose loyalty I’m damned suspicious of. I think he ought to be carted off right now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s his name?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ichiro Ogawa, a real troublemaker.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And that night Ogawa was spirited away and committed to a concentration camp on the mainland, after which there was less agitation for increased wages.</p>

  <p class="normal">NO <span>ONE</span> living in Hawaii escaped the effect of Pearl Harbor, and on the morning of December 8 practically no one could have even dimly foreseen the changes he would undergo. For example, gruff Hewlett Janders became to his surprise a full captain in the navy with control over harbor facilities. He wore an expensive khaki, some of the finest braid in the Pacific and ultimately a presidential citation for having kept the port cleared for war material.</p>

  <p class="normal">John Whipple Hewlett’s wife was caught on the mainland and had to stay there for three years. Nineteen, descendants of the old New Bedford sea captain, Rafer Hoxworth, saw service in uniform, including two girls who went into the <span>WAVES</span>. On the other hand, a total of nine female descendants of old Dr. John Whipple married military officers whom they happened to meet in Honolulu.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course, the most dramatic impact fell upon the Sakagawas, but I will save discussion of that till later, for it is important that everyone understand how this large family of Japanese aliens became, by virtue of the war, full-fledged Americans. It was ironic that years of pleading for citizenship had got the Japanese nowhere—good behavior availed them nothing—but as soon as the Japanese government destroyed Pearl Harbor and killed more than 4,000 men, everything the local Japanese had wanted was promptly given them; but as I said, I should like to postpone that ironic story for a while.</p>

  <p class="normal">Apart from the Sakagawas, the impact of that dreadful day of bombing and defeat fell heaviest upon the sprawling Kee hui. Two days after the bombing had ended, Nyuk Tsin, then ninety-four, was taken on a tour of the city by her grandson, Hong Kong, and as she saw the confusion into which the white citizens of Honolulu had fallen, she perceived that the next half year was going to provide the Kee hui with a vital opportunity for material growth, and that if it failed this rare chance, the hui would have no further claim to consideration.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Nyuk Tsin summoned her sons and abler grandsons, and when her little house in Nuuanu was jammed, and the blackout curtains were in place, she said, “All over Honolulu the haoles are preparing to run away. Asia, do you think the Japanese are going to invade Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then why are the haoles running away?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They may have better information than I do,” careful Asia replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will the Japanese airplanes come back?” Nyuk Tsin pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hear our airfields at Wheeler and Hickam were destroyed,” Asia reported, “but a navy officer at the restaurant said that even so, next time we would drive the enemy planes away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin thought about this for some time and pressed her wrinkled old hands against her sunken cheeks, then passed them back along her almost vanished hair. “Hong Kong, do you think the Japanese will be back?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They may try, but I don’t think they’ll succeed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think Honolulu is a safe place for us to gamble in?” Nyuk Tsin asked. “I mean, will the Japanese be kept out?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Asia said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does it matter?” Hong Kong asked. He was forty-eight, a hard, honest man who had been taught by his father, Africa Kee the lawyer, all the tricks of survival. Having been refused a standard education at Punahou which would have softened his attitudes, he had acquired from his father a sure instinct for the jugular. As yet he was not well known in Hawaii, having been content to allow his popular uncles to stand before the community as ostensible leaders of the great Kee hui, but Nyuk Tsin, who ran the hui, knew that in Hong Kong she had a successor just as smart and diligent as herself. Therefore, when he asked, “Does it matter?” she listened.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If Japan conquers Hawaii,” Hong Kong pointed out, “we will all be executed as leading Chinese. So we don’t have to worry about that. The F.B.I. won’t allow us to escape to the mainland, so we don’t have to worry about that, either. We’ve got to stay where we are, pray that the Japanese don’t win, and work harder than ever before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin listened, then dropped her thin hands into her lap. “Our adversity is our fortune,” she whispered. “We can’t run away, but the haoles can. Like frightened rabbits they will be leaving on every ship. And when they go, soldiers and sailors with lots of money will come in. When they arrive, we’ll be here. This war will last a long time, and if we work hard, our hui can become stronger than ever before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What should we work at?” Asia asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Land,” Nyuk Tsin replied with the terrible tenacity of a Hakka peasant who had never known enough land. “As the frightened haoles ran away, we must buy all the land they leave behind.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t have enough money to do that,” Hong Kong protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sorry,” Nyuk Tsin apologized. “I didn’t explain myself correctly. Of course we can’t afford to buy. But we can put down small deposits and promise to pay later. Then we can work the land and earn the money to pay off the debts.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But how can we get hold of enough money to start?” Hong Kong asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must spend every cent of cash we have,” Nyuk Tsin replied. “Asia, you take charge of that. Turn everything into cash. Let us run the stores on Hotel Street, because that’s where the soldiers will come. Put all our girls to work. Australia, could your granddaughters start a hot-dog stand in Waikiki?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The hui laid plans to lure every stray nickel from passing military men, but the most important tactic was still to be discussed. “Tomorrow morning, every man who is able must report to Pearl Harbor,” Nyuk Tsin directed. “If the shipyard was as badly damaged as they say, lots of men will be needed. They’ll be afraid to employ Japanese, and our men will get good jobs. But every penny earned must be given to Asia.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The family agreed that this was the right procedure, so Nyuk Tsin turned next to Hong Kong: “Your job will be the most difficult. You are to take the money that Asia provides, and you are to buy land. That is, pay just enough to get control. And remember, when people are running away in fear, they’ll accept almost any cash offer and trust in faith to get the balance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong listened, then asked, “Should I buy business land or private homes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was some discussion of this, but Nyuk Tsin finally directed: “Later, when the war is over, the big money will be in industrial land. But right now, when the island fills with people, everybody’ll want homes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So what should I do?” Hong Kong asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Buy homes now, and as their rents come in, apply the money to business property,” Nyuk Tsin advised. Then she looked at the senior members of the hui and said, “The next years will require courage. When the war ends, people will hurry back to Hawaii and say, ‘Those damned Chinese stole our land from us.’ They’ll forget that they ran away in fear, and we didn’t. But then what they say won’t matter.” She laughed tremulously and chided her men: “I’ve never seen grown men so afraid as you are tonight. If you could run away, too, you’d do so, everyone of you. But fortunately the F.B.I. won’t let you. So we must all stay here and work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From this night meeting behind bomb-proofed windows, three changes occurred in Honolulu. First, a good many of the small stores that catered to servicemen, selling them greasy food, soft drinks and candy bars, came to be operated by members of the Kee hui. Prices were kept reasonable, the stores were kept clean, and every establishment made money. Second, at Pearl Harbor, when the accelerated rebuilding of that damaged base began, a surprising number of the auditors, senior bookkeepers, expediters and managerial assistants were named Kee. Their wages were good, their work impeccable, and their behavior inconspicuous. When draft boards asked the navy, “Are you fellows out at Pearl hoarding manpower?” the navy apologetically released Mendoncas and Guerreros, but never a Kee, for the latter were essential to the war. Third, when the military began to fly in hundreds of civilian advisers, and in the case of senior officials, their families too, these men found that if they wanted to rent quarters they had to see Hong Kong Kee; even generals and admirals were told, “Better check with Hong Kong.” As the war progressed and Hawaii became horribly overcrowded, with every house renting at triple premium and every store jammed with customers, only Nyuk Tsin and Hong Kong realized how inconspicuously the Kees were converting their rent money into commercial land sites.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>THE MOST</span> subtle effect of the war fell upon Hoxworth Hale, who was only forty-three when it began. Of course he volunteered immediately, reminding the local generals of his World War I experience, but they replied that he was essential to H &amp; H, many of whose activities tied in with military requirements. He was therefore not allowed to rejoin the army. Later, when he heard that a group of Yale men were organizing a submarine outfit, he fought to get into that, feeling that he was well fitted for submarine duty, but the navy rather stiffly pointed out that the Yale men involved were more nearly his son s age than his. He therefore had to stay in Honolulu, where he worked closely with Admiral Nimitz and General Richardson, making a substantial contribution to the war effort. Along with his other duties he served as head of the draft board and chairman of the Office of Civilian Defense.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the former capacity he was pleased at the forthright manner in which young Japanese in Hawaii volunteered for military duty, and thought that the Army’s arbitrary rejection of the boys was unwarranted, and he wrote to President Roosevelt to tell him so: “I can speak of first-hand knowledge, sir, and these Japanese boys are among the most loyal citizens you will find in the nation. Why can’t you order your people to form a combat team composed of Japanese intended for use in Europe only?”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the other hand, he was distressed that so few Chinese stepped forward to bear arms in defense of America. “If they don’t volunteer,” he stormed one day, “I shall direct our draft boards to flush them out with cyanide of potassium. Where are they all?” When he had civil authorities look into the matter, he found that most of them were out at Pearl Harbor, and he asked Admiral Nimitz, “Do you mean to tell me that all those Chinese boys are essential to the war effort?” He was surprised when Nimitz looked into the matter and reported curtly: “Yes. We’ve got to have somebody out there who can use slide rules.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In early 1942 the air corps asked Hoxworth to join a group of senior officers who were flying to various South Pacific islands to study the possibilities for new airstrips, and he of course quickly consented, for with his wife in a depressed spell during which she could not converse intelligently, with his daughter in a mainland school, and his son in the air corps, he had no reason to stay at home, and the pleasure he got from climbing into uniform, with the simulated rank of colonel, was great.</p>

  <p class="normal">His military contribution to the journey of inspection was not significant, but his sociological observations were of real import, and whenever the <span>PBY</span> started to descend at bases like Johnston Island, or Canton, or Nukufetau, and he saw from the cramped windows the crystal lagoons and the wide sweep of sand upon reef, he recalled all that one of his ancestors, Dr. John Whipple, had written about the tropics, and he was able to instruct the air corps men on many points. When he first stepped upon an atoll reef he had the peculiar sensation that he had come home, and although for years he had forgotten the fact that he was part-Polynesian, that ancient ancestry came flooding back upon him, and often while the officers were inspecting possible landing areas, he would remain upon the reef, looking out to sea, and long-submerged components of his blood came surging before his eyes, and he could see canoes and voyagers.</p>

  <p class="normal">But these were not the subtle influences of which I spoke. They began when the <span>PBY</span> landed on Suva Bay, in the Fiji Islands. Hoxworth climbed into a small British boat and went ashore to meet the governor, a proper Englishman with an American wife, and the visit started out like any normal wartime trip to an island that might soon be invaded by the enemy; but as the group started looking into Fiji affairs, Hoxworth Hale began building up impressions that disturbed him deeply.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why are the Indians here kept apart?” he inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, you can’t do anything with an Indian!” the British secretary to the governor replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you ever tried working with an Oriental?” the Englishman countered. Hale made no reply, but as he studied the sugar fields in Fiji, he found them exactly like the sugar fields in Hawaii, and he had certainly worked with Japanese in precisely such surroundings, and without too much trouble. He reflected: “Indians were imported into Fiji, and Japanese were imported into Hawaii, for the same purposes at about the same time. But with what different results! In Hawaii the Japanese are reasonably good Americans. Here the Indians are totally undigested. What went wrong down here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“One good thing about it, though,” the Englishman pointed out. “If you Johnnies want to pre-empt land for your airstrips, you don’t have to worry about the bloody Indians. They’re not allowed to own any.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Orientals? Owning land?” the smart young man asked rhetorically, but to himself Hoxworth replied: “Bloody well why not? If I understand correctly, the Kees now own half the homes in Hawaii. Best thing ever happens to a Japanese is when he gets a little piece of land and starts to tidy it up. Makes him less radical and woos him away from labor unions.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So the Indians own none of the land?” Hoxworth asked aloud.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, we restrict that very severely,” the young man assured him. “Nor can they vote, so we won’t have any trouble there, either.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean, the ones born in India can’t vote,” Hoxworth queried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nor the ones born here,” the aide explained, and Hoxworth thought: “How differently we’ve done things in Hawaii.” And the more he saw of Fiji, the happier he was with the manner in which Hawaii’s Orientals had been brought into full citizenship, with no real barriers hindering them. Did the Indians go to college? There were no colleges; but in Hawaii there were and God knows the Japanese went. Did the Indians own the land on which their crowded stores perched? No, but in Hawaii the Chinese and Japanese owned whatever they liked. Did the Indians participate in civil government? Heavens no, but in Hawaii their Oriental cousins were beginning to take over some branches. Did Indians serve as government clerks? No, but in Hawaii Chinese were sought after as government employees.</p>

  <p class="normal">And so throughout his entire comparison of Fiji and Hawaii, Hoxworth Hale saw that what had been done to build the Orientals into Hawaiian life had been the right thing, and what the British in Fiji had done to keep the Indians a sullen, hateful half of the population was wrong; and it was from Fiji that Hale acquired his first insight into how fundamentally just the missionary descendants had been, for he concluded: “In Hawaii we have a sound base from which our islands can move into a constructive future: Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Caucasians and Hawaiians working together. But in Fiji, with the hatred I see between the races, I don’t see how a logical solution will ever be worked out.” Then he added grimly, but with humor, “By God, the next time I hear a Japanese sugar worker raising hell about a union, I’m going to say, ‘Watanabe-san, maybe you better go down to Fiji for a while and see how the Indians are doing.’ He’d come back to Honolulu and cry at the wharf, ‘Please, Mr. Hale, let me back on shore. I want to work in Hawaii, where things are good.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, when he was congratulating himself on the superior system evolved by his missionary ancestors, he attended a banquet given by Sir Ratu Salaka, a majestic black Fijian chief with degrees from Cambridge and Munich, and when this scion of a great Fijian family appeared dressed in a native lava-lava, with western shirt and jacket, enormous brown leather shoes, and medals of valor gained in World War I, Hale intuitively felt: “In Hawaii we have no natives like this man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sir Ratu Salaka was a powerfully oriented man. He spoke English faultlessly, knew of the progress of the war, and stood ready, although now well along in his fifties, to lead a Fijian expeditionary force against the Japanese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Remember, my good friends of the air corps,” he said prophetically, “when you invade such islands as Guadalcanal and Bougainville, where I have been on ethnological expeditions, you will require as scouts men like myself. Our dark skins will be an asset in scouting, our knowledge of the jungle will enable us to go where your men could never penetrate, and our habit of secrecy in movement will allow us to creep up upon our opponents and kill them silently, while their companions sit ten yards away. When you need us, call, for we are ready.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you have Indian troops with you?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this question the dark-skinned host exploded with laughter. “Indians?” he snorted contemptuously. “We put out a call for volunteers and out of our population of more than a hundred thousand Indians, do you know now many stepped forward? Two, and they did so with the firm stipulation that they never be required to leave Fiji. In fact, if I remember, they weren’t even willing to go to the other islands of this group. No, Mr. Hale, we wouldn’t t use any Indians. They didn’t volunteer, and we didn’t expect them to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale thought: “In Hawaii, from the same number of Japanese we could have got fifteen thousand volunteers . . . even to fight Japan. But here the Indians won’t offer to fight an enemy with whom they have no ties of emotion whatever.” And again he felt superior.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when Sir Ratu Salaka finished his brandy, like the crusty English squire he was, he observed: “In Fiji, I assure you, we are not proud of the way in which we have failed to assimilate our Indian sugar workers. Some day we shall have to pay a terrible price for our neglect—civil disturbance, perhaps even bloodshed—and I as a Fijian leader am particularly aware of this tragedy. But when I visit Hawaii, and see how dismally the Polynesians have been treated there, how their lands have been stolen from them, how Japanese fill all the good governmental jobs, and how the total culture of a great people has been destroyed, I have got to say that even though our Indians are not so well situated as your Japanese, we Fijians are infinitely better off than your Hawaiians. We own our own land. I suppose that nine-tenths of the farm land you saw today belongs to Fijians. We also control the part of the government not held by Englishmen. Today our old patterns of life are stronger than they were fifty years ago. In all things we prosper, and I can think of no self-respecting Fijian who, aware of the paradise we enjoy here, would consent to trade places with a pitiful Hawaiian who had nothing left of his own. You Americans have treated the Hawaiians horribly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A silence fell over the group, and finally Hoxworth said, “You may be surprised, Sir Ratu, and I suppose these officers will be too, but I am part-Hawaiian, and I do not feel as you suggest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sir Ratu was a tough old parliamentarian who rarely retreated, so he studied his guest carefully and said bluntly, “From appearances I should judge that the American half of you had prospered a good deal more than the Hawaiian half.” Then he laughed gallantly and offered another round of brandy, saying to Hale, “We are talking of rather serious things, Mr. Hale, but I do think this question is sometimes worth considering: For whom do invaders hold an island in trust? Here the British have said, ‘We hold these islands in trust for the ‘Fijians,’ and in doing so, they have done a great disservice, if not actual injustice, to the Indians whom they imported to work the sugar fields. But in Hawaii your missionaries apparently said, ‘We hold these islands in trust for whomever we import to work our sugar fields,’ and in saving them for the Chinese, they did a grave injustice to all Hawaiians. I suppose if our ancestors had been all-wise, they would have devised a midway solution that would have pleased everybody. But you gentlemen are heading east to Tahiti. Study the problem there. You’ll find the French did not do one damn bit better than the English here or the Americans in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To this Hale added, “At least, in Hawaii, we will never have civil war. We will never have bloodshed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sir Ratu, a giant of a man, in all ways, could not let this pass, so he added, “And in a few years you’ll have no bloody Hawaiians, either.” And the party broke up.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was with badly mixed emotions that Hoxworth Hale left Fiji, but when his <span>PBY</span> deposited the inspecting team in American Samoa he was propelled into an even more perplexing speculation. He arrived at Pago Pago the day before the islanders were scheduled to celebrate their annexation to America, which had occurred in 1900, and he was told that since a Japanese submarine had recently bombarded Samoa, the islanders this year wished to demonstrate in special ceremonies their loyalty to America. But when Hale rose next morning he saw that the forbidding peaks which surrounded Pago Pago had trapped a convoy of rain clouds, which were in the process of drenching the islands, and he assumed that the ceremonies would be cancelled.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he did not know Samoans! At dawn the native marines stood in the rain and fired salutes. At eight the Fita Fita band, in splendid uniforms, marched to the “Stars and Stripes Forever,” and by ten all citizens who could walk lined the soggy parade ground while Samoan troops executed festive maneuvers. Then a huge, golden-brown chief with a face like a rising sun and enough flesh for two men, moved to the foot of the flag pole and made an impassioned speech in Samoan, proclaiming his devotion to America. Others followed, and as they spoke, Hoxworth Hale began to catch words and finally whole phrases which he understood, and with these Polynesian tones reverberating in his memory he experienced a profound mental confusion, so that when the Fita Fita band played the “Star-Spangled Banner” and the cannon roared, he did not hear the wild cheering of the crowd.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was comparing what he had seen in Samoa with what he remembered of the way Hawaii celebrated its Annexation Day, and he was struck by the difference. In Samoa guns boomed; in Hawaii decent people maintained silence. In Samoa people cheered; in Hawaii many wept. In Samoa not even storms could daunt the islanders who wanted to watch once more their beloved new flag rising to the symbolic tip of the island; but in Hawaii the new flag was not even raised, for Hawaiians remembered that when their islands were joined to America, the act had been accomplished by trickery and injustice. In the inevitable triumph of progress, a people had been raped, a lesser society had been crushed into oblivion. It was understandable that in Samoa, Polynesians cheered Annexation Day, but in Hawaii they did not.</p>

  <p class="normal">To Hoxworth Hale these reflections were particularly gloomy, for it had been his great-grandfather Micah who had engineered the annexation of Hawaii, and Hoxworth was always reminded by his family that the event had coincided with his own birth, so that friends said, “Hawaii is the same age as Hoxworth,” thus making a family joke of what many considered a crime. But he could also remember his great-grandmother, the Hawaiian lady Malama, as she told him before she died: “My husband made me attend the ceremonies when the Hawaiian flag was torn down, and do you know what the haoles did with that flag, Hoxy? They cut it into little pieces and passed them around the crowd.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What for?” he had asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So they could remember the day,” the old lady had replied. “But why they would want to remember it I never understood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There were many Hawaiians, even in 1942, who preferred not to speak with a Hale and who refused to eat at the same table with one. But others remembered not stern Micah who had stolen their islands but his mother Jerusha who had loved the Hawaiians, and those who remembered her would eat with the Hales while the others would not. Now, in Samoa where the rains fell, Hoxworth Hale, the descendant of both Micah and Jerusha, felt their two natures warring in his sympathies, and he wished that something could be done to rectify the injustices of Hawaiian annexation so that his Polynesians would take as much pride in their new flag as the Samoans did in theirs; but he knew that this was not possible, and the old sorrow that had attacked him at Yale when he contemplated the stolen Jarves paintings returned and he thought: “Who can assess the results of an action?” And he found no joy in Samoa.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when he reached Tahiti, that Mecca of the South Seas, and his seaplane landed in the small bay that lies off Papeete, between the island of Moorea and the Diadem of Tahiti, making it surely the loveliest seaplane base in the world, his spirits were again excited, for these were the islands from which his people had come. This was the storied capital of the seas, and it was more beautiful than he had imagined. He felt proud to be of a blood that had started from Tahiti. He was disappointed in the legendary girls of the island, however, for few of them had teeth. Australian canned foods and a departure from the traditional fish diet had conspired to rob girls in their teens of their teeth, but, as one of the air corps majors said, “If a man goes for beautiful gums, he can have a hell of a time in Tahiti.”</p>

  <p class="normal">What interested Hoxworth most, however, was not the girls but the Chinese. The French governor pointed out that the Americans would find a secure base in Tahiti, because the Chinese were well in hand. They were allowed to own no land, were forbidden to enter many kinds of business, were severely spied on by currency control, and were in general so held down that the Americans could rest assured there would be no problems. Hoxworth started to say, “In Hawaii our island wealth is multiplied several times each year by the Chinese, who do own land and who do go into business. The only currency control we have is that all our banks would like to get hold of what the Chinese keep in their own banks.” But as a visitor he kept his mouth shut and looked.</p>

  <p class="normal">It seemed to him that Tahiti would be approximately ten times better off in all respects if the Chinese were not only allowed but encouraged to prosper. “You hear so much about Tahiti,” he said in some disappointment to the general leading his party, “but compare their roads to Hawaii’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shocking,” the general agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Or their health services, or their stores, or their churches.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Pretty grubby in comparison with what you fellows have done in Hawaii,” the general agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where are the Tahiti schools? Where is the university? Or the airport or the clean hospitals? You know, General, the more I see of the rest of Polynesia, the more impressed I am with Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The general was concerned with other matters, and on the third day he announced to his team: “It’s incredible, but there simply isn’t any place here in Tahiti to put an airstrip. But there seems to be an island farther north where we could probably flatten out one of the reefs and find ourselves with a pretty fine landing strip.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What island?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s called Bora Bora,” the general said, and early next morning he flew the <span>PBY</span> up there, and Hoxworth Hale thus became the first part-Hawaiian ever to see his ancestral island of Bora Bora from the air. He saw it on a bright sunny day, when a running sea was breaking on the outer reef, while the lagoon was a placid blue surrounding the dark island from which rose the tall mountains and the solid, brutal block of basalt in the middle. He gasped at the sheer physical delight of this fabled island, its deep-cut bays, its thundering surf, its outrigger canoes converging near the landing area, and he thought: “No wonder we still remember poems about this island,” and he began to chant fragments of a passage his great-great-grandfather Abner Hale had transcribed about Bora Bora:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Under the bright red stars hides the land,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Cut by the perfect bays, marked by the mountains,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Rimmed by the reef of flying spume,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Bora Bora of the muffled paddles!</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Bora Bora of the great navigators.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">The other occupants of the <span>PBY</span> were equally impressed by the island, but for other reasons. It possessed an enormous anchorage, and if necessary an entire invasion fleet could find refuge within the lagoon; but more important, the little islands along the outer reef were long, smooth and flat. “Throw a couple of bulldozers there for three days, and a plane could land right now,” an engineer volunteered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll fly around once more,” the general announced, “and see if we can agree on which of the outer islands looks best.” So while the military people looked outward, to study the fringing reef, Hoxworth Hale looked inward, to see the spires of rock and the scintillating bays that cut far inland, so that every home on Bora Bora that he could spot lay near the sea. How marvelous that island was, how like a sacred home in a turbulent sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the <span>PBY</span> leveled off and started descending toward the lagoon, and Hoxworth thought how exciting it was to be within an airplane that had the capacity to land on water, for this must have been the characteristic of the first great beasts on earth who mastered flight. They must have risen from the sea and landed on it, as the <span>PBY</span> now prepared to do. When it was near the water, speeding along at more than a hundred miles an hour, Hoxworth realized for the first time how swiftly this bird was flying, and as it reached down with its underbelly step to find the waves, he caught himself straining with his buttocks, adjusting them to insure level flight, and then seeking to let them down into the waves, and he flew his bottom so well that soon the plane was rushing along the tiptop particles of the sea, half bird, half fish, and then it lost its flight and subsided into the primordial element, a plane that had conquered the Pacific and come at last to rest upon it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Halloo, Joe!” a native cried at the door, and in a moment the plane was surrounded by Bora Borans in their swift, small canoes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Among the first to go ashore was Hale, because he knew a few words of Polynesian and many of French, and as he sat precariously on the thwarts of one of the canoes, and felt himself speeding across the limpid waters of the lagoon toward a sprawling, coconut-fringed village whose roofs were made of grass, he thought: “Hawaii has nothing to compare with this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In a way he was right, for after the general and his staff had been fed with good sweet fish from the lagoon and red wine from Paris, the headman of the village approached with some embarrassment and said in French, which Hale had to interpret: “General, we people of Bora Bora know that you have come here to save us. God himself knows the French would do nothing to rescue us, because they hate Bora Borans, and do you know why? Because in all history we have never been conquered, not even by the French, and officially we are a voluntary part of their empire. They have never forgiven us for not surrendering peacefully like the others, but we say to hell with the French.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shut him up!” the general commanded. “The French have been damned good to us, Hale, and I want to hear no more of this sedition.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the headman was already past his preamble and into more serious business: “So we Bora Borans want to help you in every way we can. You say you want to build an airstrip. Good! We’ll help. You say you’ll need water and food. Good! We’ll help there too. But there is one matter you seem not to have thought about, and on this we will help too.</p>

  <p class="normal">“While your flying boat sleeps in the lagoon, you will have to have some place to sleep on shore. We will put aside seven houses for you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell him we need only two,” the general interrupted. “We don’t want to disrupt native life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The proud headman, dressed in a brown lava-lava and flowered wreath about his temples, did not allow the interruption to divert him: “The biggest house will be for the general, and the rest are about the same size. Now because it is not comfortable for a man to sleep alone in such a house, we have asked seven of our young girls if they will take care of everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was here that Hoxworth Hale, son of missionaries, began to blush, and when the maidens were brought forth, clean, shapely, dark-haired, barefoot girls in sarongs and flowers, he began to protest, but when the headman actually started apportioning the girls, the tallest and prettiest to the general, and a shy, slim creature of fifteen to him, Hale quite broke up and the translation stopped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What the hell is this?” the general asked, but then the tall, beautiful girl of seventeen who had been assigned to him, took him gently by the hand and started leading him toward his appointed house.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My God!” the irreverent major cried. “In Bora Bora they got teeth!” And one of the girls must have known some English, for she laughed happily, and because these islanders were more primitive and ate more fish, their teeth were strong and white, and the major accepted his girl’s hand and without even so much as looking at the general, disappeared.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can’t allow this!” the general protested. “Tell them so.” But when Hale explained this decision the headman said, “We are not afraid of white babies. The island likes them.” And after a while only Hoxworth Hale stood in the meeting shed, looking at his long-tressed, fifteen-year-old Polynesian guide. She was a year older than his own daughter, not quite so tall, but equally beautiful, and he was a totally confused man, and then she took his hand and said in French, “Monsieur le Colonel, your house is waiting. We had better go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She led him along dark-graveled paths beneath breadfruit trees whose wide leaves hid the hot sun. They went along a row of coconut palms bending toward the lagoon as they had done a thousand years before, and in time she came to a small house withdrawn from the others, and here she stopped at the trivial lintel that kept out the wandering pigs and chickens, and said, “This house is mine.” She waited until he had entered, and then she joined him and untied a length of sennit that held up the woven door, and when it fell they were alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood rigid in acute embarrassment, holding onto a bundle of papers, as if he were a schoolboy, and these she took from him and then pushed him backwards slowly, until he sat on a bed with a wooden frame and a woven rope mattress, and he was as frightened as he had ever been in his life. But when she had thrown the papers into a comer she said, “My name is Tehani. And this is the house my father built me when I became fifteen. I plaited the roof of pandanus, but he built the rest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth Hale, then forty-four, was ashamed to be with a girl fifteen, but once when she passed where he was sitting on the bed, her long black hair moved past his face, and he smelled the fragrance of that sweetest of all flowers, the taire Tahiti, and he had never encountered that odor before, and automatically he reached up and caught at her hand, but she was moving rather swiftly, and he missed, but he did catch her right leg above the knee, and he felt her whole body stop at this command, and start to move willingly toward him. He kept hold of her leg and pulled her onto the bed, and she fell back happily and smiled up at him, with the taire flowers about her temples, and he took away the sarong and when she was naked she whispered, “I asked my father for you, for you were quieter than the others.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the inspecting team convened late that afternoon around an improvised table under the breadfruit trees, by common but unspoken agreement, no one mentioned what had happened, and they proceeded to discuss where the airstrip should be, just as if nothing unusual had occurred, but as night fell and girls appeared with an evening meal, each officer instinctively brought his girl to the table beside him, and there was unprecedented tenderness in the way the older men saw to it that their young companions got a fair division of the food.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had not finished eating when a group of young men with long hair in their eyes and pareus about their hips, appeared with guitars and drums, and soon the Bora Bora night was filled with echoes. The audience waited until the general’s tall, slim beauty leaped into the dancing ring and executed the wild, passionate dance of that island. This was a signal which permitted the other girls to do the same, and soon one had the cocky major in the ring with her, attempting a version of the dance, and he was followed by a colonel and then by the general himself. It became a wild, frenzied, delightful dance under the stars, and all the older people who were watching applauded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth Hale’s girl, Tehani, did not ask him to dance, knowing from what had transpired in the grass house that he was a shy man, so finally an old woman with no teeth muscled her way through the crowd, stood before Hale and did a few lascivious steps. To the surprise of everyone, Hale leaped to his feet and swung into the Hawaiian hula, at which, like most of his Honolulu contemporaries, he was skilled. The audience stopped making noise and the military visitors sat down, tired as they were from their own exertions, while Hale and the old woman performed an admirable dance. Finally, when the astonishment was becoming vocal, the major shouted, “Hale for President!” and Hoxworth broke into a much swifter version while the old woman executed a downright lewd movement, to the howls of the crowd.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this Tehani stepped forward, firmly pushed the old beldame away and took her place, and for a few minutes Hale and the delicately formed young girl with streams of flowers in her hair, brought an ancient grace to the sands of Bora Bora. He felt himself caught up in passions he had thought long dead, while the girl smiled softly to herself and, knowing that she was the envy of all the others for her man could dance, thought: “I got the best one of the group, and I was smart enough to ask for him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The inspecting team lingered at Bora Bora for nine days, and every night during that time the entire community held an all-night celebration. From the nearby island of Raiatea, which in the old days had been known as Havaiki, the holy island of the Polynesians, a young French government official came over with a barrel of red wine which the general insisted on buying, although the gracious young man had intended it as a gift, and at dusk each day this barrel was cocked, and anyone who wished a drink could have one. The orchestra never stopped playing. In exhaustion men would drop their drums and others would pick them up. The seven girls who were tending the guests of honor rarely left them, so that in the end even at formal meetings of the inspection staff, the Polynesian girls would be there, not understanding a word that was being spoken, but each one proud whenever her man spoke forcefully on some point or other.</p>

  <p class="normal">During the nine days no mention was made of sex, except once when the general remarked thoughtfully, “I am amazed at what a man of forty-nine can do.” But he was taking a two-hour nap morning, afternoon, and evening.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth preferred not even to think of Tehani as a real person. She was something that happened, a dream whose confines would never be appropriately known. Having experienced a normal Punahou and Yale education, he had been roughly aware of what sex was, but never accurately, and his marriage had been a family affair, which for a while had been formally proper, like going on an endless picnic with one’s fully clothed sister, but soon even that had ended, and when at odd moments in the last few years he had thought about sex he had supposed that for him, at least, it had ended in his mid-thirties. Tehani Vahine, for that was her whole name, Miss Tehani of Bora Bora, had quite other intentions. She had been taught that men of Colonel Hale’s age were those who enjoyed sex most, and who were often most proficient in it; and whereas she had been wrong in both guesses about Hale, for he was both afraid and unskilled, she had never known a man who could learn so fast.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were days of listless, idle joy. He loved her best when she wore her sarong draped carelessly about her hips, her breasts bare and her long hair sparkling with flowers. He would lie endlessly upon the rope bed and watch her movements, as if he had never seen a girl before, and sometimes with a cry of joy he would leap up, catch her in his arms and carry her to the bed in a blizzard of kisses. Once he asked her, “Is it always like this in Bora Bora?” and she replied, “Usually we don’t have so much good wine.” And he thought: “In other parts of the world there is a war, and in Hawaii nervous men are arguing with each other, and in New York girls are calculating, ‘Should I let him tonight?’ But in Bora Bora there’s Tehani.” Like the general, he was amazed at what a man of forty-four could do … if he had the right encouragement.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the next-to-the-last day Tehani whispered, “Tell the others you won’t be there tomorrow,” and at dawn she sprinkled water on his face and cried, “You must get up and see the fish!”</p>

  <p class="normal">She led him sleepily to a spot away from her house where she had a fresh tuna staked out and cleaned. “This is going to be the best dish you ever ate in your life,” she assured him, “because it will be Bora Bora poisson cru. Watch me how I do it, so that when you are far away and went to remember me, you can make some and taste me in it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She cut the fresh tuna into small fillets of about two inches in length and a quarter inch thick. These she placed in a large calabash, which she carried to the lagoon where no people came, and from the cold waters she dipped a few coconut shells full of fresh salt water which she tossed on the fillets. Then she took a club and knocked down three limes, which she cut in half and squeezed into the calabash. Carefully seeking a place where the sun shone brightest, she put the fish there to steam through the long, hot morning, cooking itself in the lime juice and sea water.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now comes the part where you must help me!” she cried merrily as she pointed to a sloping palm that bent over the water, holding in its crest a bundle of ripe nuts. “I shall climb up there, but you must catch the nuts for me,” and before he could stop her, she had tied her sarong about her hips, had caught hold of the tree with her hands and feet, and had bent-walked right up the tree to where the nuts clustered. Holding on with her left hand, she used her right to twist free a choice nut. Then, with a wide side-arm movement, she tossed it inland, where Hoxworth caught it. “Hooray!” she cried in glee and pitched another.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she returned to earth she found a stout stick, jammed it in the earth, and showed her partner how to husk a coconut, and when he had done so, she knocked the two nuts together until they cracked open and their juices ran into a second calabash. Then she jammed into the ground a second stick, this time at an angle, and against its blunt edge she began scraping the coconut slowly and ‘rhythmically, until white meat, dripping with nectar, began shredding down onto taro leaves placed on the ground. As her golden shoulders swayed back and forth in the sunlight, she sang:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Grating the coconut for my beloved,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Shredding the sweet meat for him,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Salting the fish,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Under the swaying breadfruit tree,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Under the rainless sky,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>I shred the sweet meat for my beloved.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">When she finished grating she ignored Hoxworth, as if he were not there, and carefully gathered the shredded coconut, placing half in the calabash to join the captured coconut water, half in a tangle of brown fiber from the coconut husks, which she now caught in her slim hands and squeezed over a third calabash. As she twisted the coarse fibers, a fine rich liquor was forced out, and this was the sweet coconut milk that would complete the dish she was preparing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again and again Tehani squeezed the grated coconut, softly chanting her song, though now she spoke of twisting the meat for her beloved instead of grating it, and as the palms along the shore dipped toward the lagoon, Hoxworth Hale had a strikingly clear intuition: “From now on whenever I think of a woman, in the abstract … of womanliness, that is … I’ll see this brown-skinned Bora Bora girl, her sarong loosely about her hips, working coconut and humming softly in the shadowy sunlight. Has she been here, under these breadfruit trees, all these last empty years?” And he had a second intuition: that during the forthcoming even emptier years, she would still be there, a haunting vision of the other half of life, the womanliness, the caretaking symbol, the majestic, lovely, receptive other half.</p>

  <p class="normal">Overcome by his vision of past and future, he desired to revel in the accidental now, and reached out from the shaded area where she had placed him, trying to catch her leg again, but she deftly evaded him and went to a pit where yams and taro had been baking, and she now proceeded to break the latter into small purplish pieces, rich in starch, while the yams she held in her hands for a moment, showing them to her lover. “These are what our sailors call the Little Eyes of Heaven,” she laughed, pointing to the eyes of the yam, which clustered like the constellation whose rising in the east heralds the Polynesian New Year.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, Tehani chopped the onions and then mixed all the vegetables in with the thick, rich coconut milk, and after she had washed her hands in the lagoon, she came back and sat cross-legged before Hale, her sarong pulled far up to expose soft brown thighs, and her breasts free in the sunlight. “It’s a game we play,” she explained, and with him in the shadows and she in the sunlight, she started slapping his shoulders, and as she hummed her coconut song, she indicated that he was to slap hers, and in this way she passed from his shoulders to his forearms, to his flanks, to his hips and finally to his thighs, and as the game grew more intense the slaps grew gentler and her song slower, until with a culminating gesture that started out to be a slap but which ended as an embrace, Hale caught her sarong and started pulling it away, but she cried softly in her own language, “Not in the sunlight, Hale-tane,” and he understood, and swept her up in his arms and carried her into the grass house, where the game reached its intended conclusion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward noon she asked him in French, “Do you like the way we make our poisson cru in Bora Bora?” And she brought in the fish, well saturated in sun and lime juice, and Hale saw that the tuna was no longer red but an inviting gray-white. Into it she mixed the prepared coconut milk with its burden of taro and onions and yams. Next she tossed in a few shellfish for flavor, and over the whole she sprinkled the freshly grated, juicy coconut. With her bare right hand she stirred the ingredients and finally offered her guest three fingers full of Bora Bora raw fish.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is how we feed our men on this island,” she teased. “Can your girls do as well?” When Hale laughed, she pushed the dripping fish into his mouth and chuckled when the white milk ran down his chin and across his naked chest. “You are so sloppy!” she chided. “But you are such an adorable man, Hale-tane. You can laugh. You are tender. You dance like an angel. And you are strong in bed. You are a man any girl could love. Tell me,” she begged, “do your girls at home love you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” he said truthfully, “they do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do they sometimes play games like the slapping game with you, and then chase you around the house just for the fun of being with you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” he replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am sorry, Hale-tane,” she said. “The years go by very fast and soon . . .” She pointed to an old woman searching for shellfish along the shore: “Then we play no more games.” It was with the sadness of the world turning in space, or of the universe drifting madly through the darkness, that she said these words in island French: “Et bientot c’est tout fini et nous ne jouons plus.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is that why your father builds you a house of your own when, you’re fifteen?” Hale asked. “So you can learn the proper games?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” she explained. “No sensible man would want to marry me unless he knew that I understood how to make love properly. Men are happiest when a girl has proved she can have a baby, and do you know what I hope, Hale-tane? I hope that when you fly away tomorrow you leave in here a baby for me.” She patted her flat brown stomach which looked as if it could never contain a child. “That is my wish.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And so they lazed the day away, and ate poisson cru, the best dish that any island ever invented, and played the silly games of love that Bora Borans had been teaching their daughters for nearly two thousand years, and in. due time shadows crept across the lagoon, and night fell, and after the drams had been beating at the village dancing ground for some hours, Tehani wrapped herself in a sarong and said, “Come, Hale-tane, I should like the people of Bora Bora to see me dancing with you one more time. Then, if I do have your baby, they will remember that among all the Americans, you were the best dancer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the morning, as the inspection team piled into the <span>PBY</span> for take-off and the return to Hawaii, no one spoke of the long-haired girls of Bora Bora, or of their flashing teeth, or of the games they knew how to play, for if anyone had spoken, all would have wanted to remain, on the island for another day, another week; but when the plane had torn its bulk free from the waters of the lagoon and stood perched on what the aviators called “the step,” the small after-portion on which the huge boat rode on the waves until it finally soared into the air, Hale again felt the aesthetic moment when men are half of the ocean, and half of the air, and in this attitude the speeding <span>PBY</span> whipped across the lagoon until it finally soared aloft, and all were wholly of the sky.</p>

  <a id="section_2"></a>

  <p class="normal">It was then, as Bora Bora disappeared in the brilliance of morning sunlight, that the major observed bitterly, “To think! We’re going to draft decent young American boys, tear them from their mothers’ arms, slam them into uniform and send them down to Bora Bora. God, it’s inhuman.” And for the rest of the war, and for many years thereafter, there would be a confraternity of men who met casually in bars, or at cocktail parties, or at business luncheons, and one would say to the other, “They write mostly crap about the Pacific, but there’s one island . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you speaking of Bora Bora?” the other would interrupt.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Did you serve there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yep.” Usually, nothing more was said, because if a man had served his hitch on Bora Bora nothing more was required to be said, but whenever Hoxworth Hale met such men he invariably went one step further: “Did you ever know a slim, long-haired girl of fifteen or sixteen? Lived by the mountain. Named Tehani.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Once he met a lieutenant-commander from a destroyer-escort who had known Tehani, and the destroyer man said, “Wonderful girl. Danced like an angel. She was the first one on the island to have an American baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Was it a boy?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, but she gave it to a family on Maupiti. Girls there had no chance to produce American babies, and the island wanted one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And suddenly, in the smoke-filled bar, Hoxworth Hale saw a young girl dancing beside a lagoon, and he saw on the blue waters an ancient double-hulled canoe and he thought: “I am forever a part of Bora Bora, and my son lives on in the islands.” Then the memory vanished and he heard a girl’s voice lamenting: “The years go by very fast, and soon we play no more games.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In time, Hale’s visit to the South Seas produced other fruit than his memory of Tehani Vahine, for in addition to her lilting song of the coconut-grater, he constantly recalled his conversation with Sir Ratu Salaka in Fiji, and he began to compare all aspects of Hawaii with similar conditions in Fiji and Tahiti, and he came to this unshakable conclusion: “In every respect but one we Americans have done a better job in Hawaii than the English have in Fiji or the French in Tahiti. Health, education, building and the creation of new wealth … we are really far ahead. And in the way we’ve integrated our Orientals into the very heart of our society, we’re so far ahead that no comparisons are even permissible. But in the way we have allowed our Hawaiians to lose their land, their language, and their culture, we have been terribly remiss. We could have accomplished all our good and at the same time protected the Hawaiians.” But whenever he reached this conclusion he would think of Joe Tom Char, who now presided as president of the senate, and he was half-Hawaiian, half-Chinese; or of the year’s beauty queen, Helen Fukuda, half-Hawaiian, half-Japanese; or of the innumerable Kees who seemed to be running Pearl Harbor, many of whom were half-Hawaiian, half-Chinese. “Perhaps we’re building something in Hawaii that will be infinitely better than anything Fiji or Tahiti ever produces.” At any rate, Hale returned from his trip no longer apologetic for what the missionaries had accomplished.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN</span> in the early days of the war Japanese boys in Hawaii were removed from combat units and expelled from R.O.T.C., the islands supposed that this was the end of the matter. “No Jap can be trusted, so we kicked them all out,” a general explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">But to everyone’s surprise, the Japanese boys stubbornly refused to accept this verdict. Humbly, quietly, but with an almost terrifying moral force, these boys began to press for their full rights as American citizens. “We demand the inalienable privilege of dying for the nation we love,” they argued, and if anyone had asked the Sakagawa boys why they said this, they would have replied, “We were treated decently at McKinley and at Punahou. We were taught what democracy means, and we insist upon our right to defend it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Committees of Japanese boys began hammering officials with petitions. One drawn up by Goro Sakagawa read: “We are loyal American citizens and humbly request the right to serve our nation in its time of crisis. If you think you cannot trust us to fight against Japan, at least send us to Europe where this problem does not arise.” The committees went to see generals and admirals, governors and judges: “We will do any national work you assign us. We will ask for no wages. We must be allowed to prove that we are Americans.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For eleven painful weeks the Japanese boys got nowhere, and then, because the three younger Sakagawas were Punahou boys, they were able to meet one of the most extraordinary men Hawaii was to produce in the twentieth century. His name was Mark Whipple, born in 1900, the son of the medical doctor who had ordered Chinatown burned, great-great-grandson of John Whipple who had .helped Christianize Hawaii. This Mark Whipple was a West Point man and a colonel in the United States Army. Most of his duty had been spent outside Hawaii, but recently he had been assigned to help the high command deal with the Japanese question; and in Washington it had been assumed that when he got to Hawaii he would quickly order the evacuation of all Japanese—none of whom could be trusted—to some concentration camp either in Nevada or on the island of Molokai: “This will include, of course, all the little yellow bastards who have infiltrated themselves into such units as the 298th Infantry and the local R.O.T.C. outfits.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Colonel Mark Whipple disappointed just about everybody, for when he reached Hawaii bearing very powerful directives specifically handed him by President Roosevelt, who knew his family, he gave no quick orders, paraded no insolence, but went swiftly to work. The first man he called in for a conference was the Honolulu head of the F.B.I., who reported, as Whipple had anticipated: “So far as we have presently ascertained, there was not a single case of espionage by any Japanese other than the registered and duly appointed agents of the Japanese consulate, all of whom were citizens of Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then the Secretary of Navy’s hasty report that Pearl Harbor was betrayed by local Japanese was all hogwash?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. But he can be forgiven. Excited admirals fed him the line. Now they know better.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Any disloyalty now?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Quite the contrary. The young Japanese seem to be burning to get into uniform. Had two of them in here the other day. Fine boys. Got kicked out of R.O.T.C. and now want us to use them as labor battalions, anything. They offer to serve with no pay.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You got their names?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Right here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Colonel Whipple hesitated before taking the paper. “I promise you that I will not write down what you reply to my next question. But I need guidance. Will you state categorically that the local Japanese have not engaged in sabotage of any kind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will state categorically that there has not been a single case of sabotage,” the F.B.I, man said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple drummed his fingers. “I’d like to see those names. Can you get the boys in here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">As a result of that meeting the Varsity Victory Volunteers were formed with Tadao and Minoru Sakagawa as first members. The V.V.V. were all Japanese, all boys of the highest intelligence and patriotism. They foresaw that the entire future of their people in America depended upon what they did in this war against Japan, and they decided that if they were prevented by hysteria from bearing arms, they would bear shovels. They would dig out latrines, and pick up after white soldiers, and build bridges. There would be no work too menial for them, and they would do it all for $90 a month while their haole and Chinese schoolmates earned ten times that much working for the government in civilian jobs at Pearl Harbor. As Tadao told Colonel Whipple, “We will do anything to prove that we are Americans.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Colonel Whipple, when he recommended that the V.V.V. be established, drew a good deal of criticism from his fellow officers, but he pointed out that he carried a special command from Roosevelt to see exactly what could be done with the Japanese, and he was going to explore all possibilities; but when he next proposed that no Japanese be evacuated to prison camps, neither on Molokai nor anywhere else, the roof fell in.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you mean to say …” a South Carolina admiral bellowed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I mean to say, sir, that these people are loyal Americans and no purpose would be served by placing them in prison camps.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why, goddamn it, California has shown us the way to handle these traitors.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What California has done is its own affair. Here in Hawaii we won’t do it that way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“By God, Whipple! You’re subversive!”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Mark Whipple was not deviated one degree from the true course he had set himself. When a convocation of his own family warned him, “There’s a good deal of apprehension about you, Mark. Military people say you’re imperiling your whole career,” he replied, “In this matter, I have a special burden to bear which only I can bear, and I would prefer to hear no more gossip of any kind. Because what I am about to propose next is going to tear this entire military community apart. Maybe you’d better fortify your tired nerves.”</p>

  <p class="normal">What he proposed was this: “I think we had better form, right now—this week—a special unit of the United States Army composed solely of Japanese boys from Hawaii. Use them in Europe. Throw them against the Germans, and when they perform as I know they will, they’ll not only re-establish their credentials here but in America. They will give all free men a propaganda victory over Naziism that will reverberate around the world. With their courage, they will prove Hitler wrong on every single count of his philosophy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A gasp went up, which was duly reported by cable to Washington, where it was augmented: “Japanese troops in the American Army? And a special unit at that? Ridiculous.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But one man did not think it ridiculous, the President of the United States, and when he had studied Colonel Whipple’s report he issued a statement which read: “Patriotism is not a matter of the skin’s color. It is a matter of the heart.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In Hawaii there was still vigorous opposition to the formation of such a unit, but when the President’s order reached Honolulu in mid-May of 1942 grudging compliance was obligatory, and one gruff general asked, “Who’d want to march into battle with a regiment of Japs behind him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would,” Colonel Whipple replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean . . . you’re volunteering for the job?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ve got it, and I hope you don’t get shot in the back.” Colonel Whipple saluted and took prompt steps to assemble into one unit all the Japanese boys already in the army—men like Goro Sakagawa of the 298th Infantry—and to pave the way for later acceptance of others like those now in the V.V.V. or those like young Shigeo who were about ready for the draft. The Whipple family was distressed that their most brilliant son was imperiling his career by such imprudent action, but as he had told them earlier, in this matter he bore a special burden.</p>

  <p class="normal">It arose from the fact that when he was a boy in Honolulu no Chinese would speak to him, for he was the son, of the man who had burned Chinatown at the instigation of the haole merchants. He could never bring himself to believe that his gentle, courageous father, Dr. Whipple, had done such a thing, but the Chinese were certain that he had. To them the name of Whipple was ugly, and they were not reluctant to demonstrate this fact to young Mark. Finally, when his own haole playmates began to tease him, he accosted his father and had asked him point-blank: “Dad, did you burn Chinatown?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, in a manner of speaking, I did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In order to put the Chinese merchants out of business?”</p>

  <p class="normal">His father had stopped and bowed his head. “So now you’ve heard that? What did they say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They say there was a little sickness, and the haole storekeepers talked you into burning Chinatown and putting all the Chinese out of business.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now exactly who said this, son?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The haoles. The Chinese didn’t say it because they won’t even speak to me. But I know they think it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Hewlett Whipple was then a man of forty, and about as successful a medical practitioner as one could hope to be in Honolulu, but the weight of his son’s charge was very heavy indeed upon his soul. He led his twelve-year-old son to a grassy spot under a tree on the lawn of his Punchbowl home and said, “Now you ask me all the questions that worry you, Mark. And never forget what I reply.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you burn Chinatown?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And did the Chinese lose all their stores?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mark had no further questions, so he shrugged his shoulders. His father laughed and said, “You aren’t going to stop there, are you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ve told me what I wanted to know,” the boy replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But aren’t you concerned about the real truth? What really happened?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, like the boys said, you admitted burning the place.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mark, this is what truth is. Going behind what you hear first. Asking a hundred questions until you can make up your own mind on the basis of real evidence. Now let me ask the questions that you should have. All right?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Okay.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dr. Whipple, why did you burn Chinatown? Because a dreadful plague threatened the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did burning Chinatown help save the city? It saved ten thousand lives.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you intend to burn the Chinese stores? No, the fire got out of hand. It ran away from us.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you do anything to help the Chinese? I ran into the middle of the fire myself and helped them to safety.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were you sorry that the fire got out of hand? When I got home and looked back upon the destruction I sat down and wept.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would you burn it again under the same circumstances? I would.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A silence fell over the Whipples and they looked down at their city. Young Mark, in those moments, caught a glimmer of what truth was, but what his father said next exploded truth from a shimmering substance playing upon the edges of the mind into a radiant reality, for he said, “There are two other questions which have to be asked, and these require longer answers. Are you ready?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dr. Whipple, tell me honestly, were there not some haoles who were glad to see Chinatown burned? Of course there were. And some Chinese, too. Any good action in the world will be used by some to their own economic advantage. Any misfortune will be used the same way. Therefore, you would expect some to profit from the burning and to be glad that it happened. When the fire was over, these same men rebuilt Chinatown exactly as it was before, so as to keep on making a little money from the hovels. So if your Chinese friends say there were some who were glad to see the Chinese stores destroyed, they are correct. But I was not one of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dr. Whipple, can you not, even so, understand why the Chinese hate you? Of course I understand. They believe falsehood, and it’s always easier to accept a lie than to find out the truth. When I move through Honolulu, this is one of the burdens I am forced to bear. The Chinese hate me. But if they knew the truth, they would not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As a colonel in the United States Army, Mark Whipple often remembered that discussion with his father, and sometimes when he was required to make his men do brutal or unpleasant work, he knew that in ignorance they would hate him, whereas if they knew the truth they would not. So when he returned to Hawaii to deal with the Japanese problem, he was motivated by an acute desire that he, Mark Whipple, should, by dealing with the Japanese honestly, erase the stigma that his father Hewlett Whipple had suffered at the hands of the Chinese. In a sense, therefore, he did not volunteer to lead the Japanese troops; he was impelled by the entire history of his family to do so; for the Whipples of Hawaii were – people who tried always to keep history straight.</p>

  <p class="normal">His all-Japanese outfit, commanded by a cadre of haole officers, was known as the 222nd Combat Team, and it became a running joke in the unit for older men to ask newcomers, “What’s your outfit, son?” And when the private replied, “The Two-Two-Two,” the old-timers would shout, “Listen! He’s playing train!” Later they would bellow, “What’s your unit?” and the private replied, “The Two-Two-Two,” they would growl, “Speak up, son! Don’t stutter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The arm patch of. the Two-Two-Two consisted of a blue sky against which rose a brown Diamond Head, at whose feet rested one palm tree and three white lines of rolling surf. Below in block letters stood the pidgin motto: “Mo Bettah.” It was a handsome patch, and spoke of Hawaii, but the outfit did not appreciate how much Mo Bettah home was than some other places until they set up their basic training camp at Camp Bulwer in the boondocks of Mississippi.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the first day in town Goro Sakagawa had to go to the toilet, and through ignorance stumbled into the “White” toilet. “Get out of here, you goddamned yellow-belly!” a native growled, and Goro backed out. Others had similar experiences, so that trouble threatened, but that night Colonel Mark Whipple showed the kind of man he was. Assembling the entire unit he shouted, “You men have only one job. Allow nothing whatever, neither death nor humiliation nor fear nor hunger, to deviate you from that job. You are here to prove to America that you are loyal citizens. You can do this only by becoming the finest soldiers in the American army and the most efficient fighters.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If the people of Mississippi want to abuse you, they are free to do so. And you will keep your big mouths shut and take it. Because if any man in this outfit causes even one shred of trouble, I will personally ride him right to the gates of hell. Are there any questions?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Am I supposed to take it if some local yokel calls me a slant-eyed yellow-belly?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes!” Whipple stormed. “By God yes! Because if you’re so sensitive that you are willing to imperil the future of all the Japanese in America for such a cause, then by God, Hashimoto, you are a slant-eyed yellow-belly. You’re a creep. You’re a damned Jap. You’re what everybody accuses you of being, and in my eyes you’re no man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then we take it?” Goro asked in deep, stomach-churning fury. “Whatever they want to call us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You take it,” Whipple snarled. “Can’t you add, you damned, stubborn buddha-heads?” As he said this he laughed, and the tension was broken. “For the insults that one accidental man throws at you, are you willing to put into jeopardy the future of three hundred thousand Japanese? Don’t be idiots. For the love of Christ, don’t be idiots.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From the rear ranks a sergeant grumbled, “I guess we can take it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Colonel Whipple said, “Keep this vision in mind, men. As a unit you’re going to strike the German army some day. And when you do, you’re going to win. Of that there can be no doubt, for I have never led finer men. And when you win, you will triumph over bigotry at home, over Hitlerism abroad, over any insult you have ever borne. Your mothers and fathers and your children after you will lead better lives because of what you do. Aren’t these stakes worth fighting for?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Colonel Whipple laid down the most rigid rules and enforced them brutally: “Not a word of Japanese will be spoken in this outfit. You’re Americans. Under no circumstances are you to ask a white girl for a date. It makes local people mad. You are absolutely forbidden to date a colored girl. That makes them even madder. And they have four long trains that haul beer into this state every week. You can’t possibly drink it all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Remorselessly Colonel Whipple drove his men according to West Point traditions of military behavior and his own family traditions of civil decency. In all America no unit in training suffered more disciplinary action than the Two-Two-Two, for their colonel held them responsible both on the post and off, and at the slightest infraction, he punished them. There was only one flare-up. After a great deal of heart-probing consultation the good people of Mississippi decided that so far as public toilets and buses were concerned, the Japanese soldiers were to be considered white men and were thus obligated to use white facilities; but where socializing with the community was concerned, it was better if they considered themselves halfway between the white and the Negro and off-limits to each.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was too much, and Goro went to see Colonel Whipple. “I appreciate what you said, Colonel, and we’ve been abiding by your rules. But this directive on toilets is just too much. I can urinate like a white man but I’ve got to socialize like a Negro. The basic thing we’re fighting for is human decency. Our men don’t want the kind of concessions Mississippi is willing to make. We want to be treated like Negroes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Colonel Whipple did not rant. He said quietly, “I agree with you, Sakagawa. Decency is one unbroken fabric without beginning or end. No man can logically fight for Japanese rights and at the same time ignore Negro rights. Logically he can’t do it, but sometimes he’s got to. And right now is one of those times.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean we’re to accept what Mississippi says, even though we know that given a chance they’d treat us worse than they do the Negroes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s the tactical situation you find yourself in.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s so illogical our men may not be able to take it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Again Colonel Whipple failed to bellow. Instead he picked up an order and waved it at Goro, saying, “And the reason you’ll take it is this paper. The army has agreed to accept all Japanese boys who want to volunteer. Your two brothers in the V.V.V. will be transferred to the outfit tonight. Now if trouble were to start in Mississippi, all that I’ve managed to acquire for you fellows would be lost. So, Goro, you urinate where the haoles tell you to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In accordance with the new directive, the army announced that it would beef up the Two-Two-Two by adding 1,500 volunteers from Hawaii and 1,500 from the mainland, but the plan didn’t work because in Honolulu 11,800 rushed forward to serve, stampeding the registration booths. Seven out of eight had to be turned down, including Shigeo Sakagawa, who wept. But on the mainland only 500 volunteered, leaving a thousand empty spaces. Quickly the army returned to Hawaii and filled the gaps left by the poor response of the mainland Japanese, and in this second draft, young Shig was accepted.</p>

  <p class="normal">When President Roosevelt compared the contrasting reactions of the two groups, he ordered Colonel Whipple to submit an explanation of what had happened, and Whipple wrote: “Far from being a cause for concern, the differential should encourage us in our devotion to the perpetual effectiveness of democracy. If the result had been any different, I should have been worried. That the Hawaii Japanese behaved well and that the mainland boys did not is to me, and I think to America, reassuring.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In Hawaii, Japanese were free to own land. In California they were not. In Hawaii they could become schoolteachers and government employees. In California they could not. In Hawaii they were accepted into our best schools, but not in California. In Hawaii they were built into our society and became a part of us, but in California they were rejected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“More important, when war came the Japanese on the mainland were herded into concentration camps and their belongings were ruthlessly stripped from them at five cents on the dollar. In Hawaii there was some talk of this, but it was never permitted to go very far. Right after Pearl Harbor a good many Japanese in Hawaii were rounded up for concentration camps, but my aunt tells me that she personally, along with other Caucasian leaders of the community, went to the jail and effected the release of those she knew to be loyal. In short, the Japanese in Hawaii had every reason to fight for America; those on the mainland had none; and the basic difference lay not in the Japanese but in the way they were treated by their fellow citizens.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So is it not logical that if you tell a group of Hawaiian Japanese who have not been thrown into camps or robbed of their belongings, ‘You can volunteer to help us fight oppression! that 11,800 should leap forward? And is it not logical that if you go through concentration camps and tell the brothers of these same men, ‘We have abused you, imprisoned you, humiliated you, and stolen your belongings, but now we want you to volunteer to fight for us,’ is it not logical that they should reply, ‘Go to hell’? I am astonished that so many of the mainland Japanese volunteered. They must be very brave men, and I shall welcome them in my unit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When President Roosevelt read the report he asked his aide, “Who is this Mark Whipple again?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You knew his father, Dr. Hewlett Whipple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The boy sounds intelligent. Is he the one who’s leading the Japanese?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. They’re on their way to Italy now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We should expect some good news from that outfit,” the President said.</p>

  <p class="normal">One night in September, 1943, Nyuk Tsin asked her grandson Hong Kong, “Are we overextended?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If war ended tomorrow, would we be able to hold onto our properties?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you think we should do?” the old lady asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I seem to have acquired your courage,” Hong Kong replied. “I say, ‘Hold onto our lands.’ We’ll pay off as much debt as we can, and when the war ends we’ll tighten our belts and live on rice until the boom starts.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many bad years must we look forward to?” the old matriarch asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two very difficult years. Two reasonably dangerous. If we can get through them, the hui will be prosperous.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m worried,” the old woman confessed, “but I agree with you that we must fight to a finish. However, I’ve been thinking that we might start to sell off a few of the houses, to relieve the pressure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The pressure is only on you and me,” Hong Kong pointed out. “The others don’t know about it. If you’re not afraid, I’m not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a curious thing for an old woman of ninety-six to be worrying about the future, but she was, and it was not her future that concerned her, but that of her great family, the on-going thing that she had started but which was now more powerful than she. Therefore she said, “It is not only our money we are gambling with, Hong Kong, but that of all the Kees, those who are working and the girls in the stores and the old people. Thinking of them, are you still willing to hold onto everything?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is for them that I’m doing it,” Hong Kong replied. “I know the delicate structure we’ve built. A house on top of a store on top of a job at Pearl Harbor on top of a little piece of land on top of an old man’s savings. Maybe it’s all going to crumble, but I’m willing to gamble that when it starts to totter, you and I will be smart enough to catch the falling pieces.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think it’s beginning to totter now, Hong Kong,” the old woman warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think it is,” her grandson replied, and for once he ignored his grandmother’s advice, and she said, “This is your decision, Hong Kong,” and he replied, “We started our adventure when the haoles ran away from the war, and I’m not going to run away now,” and she promised, “At least I won’t tell the others of my fears.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He therefore held onto the fantastic, teetering structure—depending solely upon his own courage—and as Honolulu rents rose, and wages at Pearl Harbor, and profits from the stores, he applied the money Asia provided to further gambles, and the structure grew higher and more precarious, but he was never afraid of his perilous construction, and his old grandmother grew increasingly to realize that in Hong Kong she had developed a grandson she could truly admire. “In many ways,” she reflected, thinking back to the High Village and the warm days of her youth, “he is like my father. He is bold, and willing to engage in great battles, and he will probably wind up with his head in a cage in the center of Honolulu.” Then she thought of her father’s grisly visage, staring, neck less, down upon the years, and she concluded: “Was it a bad way to die?” And the perilous gamble of the Kee hui continued.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHILE</span> the four Sakagawa boys were in uniform, righting for an unqualified citizenship, their parents and their sister Reiko were experiencing grave contradictions and confusions. On the one hand, the older Sakagawas prayed for the safe return of their sons, and this implied an American victory, at least over the Germans, and accordingly they listened with gratification when Reiko-chan read them the local Japanese newspaper, the Nippu Jiji, which told of victory in Europe. But on the other hand, they continued to pray for Japanese victory in Asia, for their homeland was in trouble and they hoped that it would triumph, never admitting to themselves that American victory in Europe and Japanese victory in Asia were incompatible.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then one day Mr. Ishii appeared furtively at the barbershop, whispering, “Tremendous news! I must stop to see you tonight.” And before Sakagawa-san could halt the little man, the latter had vanished into another Japanese store.</p>

  <p class="normal">That evening, after Sakagawa had closed the barbershop and walked the girl barbers safely home; ignoring the whistles of American sailors who loafed on Hotel Street, Kamejiro said to Reiko, “You can be sure that Mr. Ishii has something very important for us,” and the two hurried through the dark streets to the little cottage in Kakaako. There Mr. Ishii waited, and after the household was settled and the blinds drawn, he strode dramatically to the table where the day’s issue of the Nippu Jiji lay and with fury tore it to bits, threw it on the floor, and spat on it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thus I treat the enemies of Japan!” he cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I haven’t read it . . .” Reiko pleaded, trying to halt him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never again will you read that filthy propaganda!” Mr. Ishii announced grandly. “I told you, didn’t I, that it was all American lies? You laughed at me and said, ‘What does Mr. Ishii know about war?’ My friends, I will tell you what I know. I know what is really happening in the world. And in America all good Japanese know. It is only you fools who have to read the Hawaii newspapers who do not know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Flamboyantly, he whipped out from his coat pocket a Japanese newspaper printed in Wyoming, the Prairie Shinbun, and there for Reiko to see were the exciting headlines: “Imperial Forces Defeat Americans in Bougainville.” “Great Japanese Victory at Gaudalcanal.” “President Roosevelt Admits Japan Will Win the War.” Most of the stories appearing on the front pages had been picked up from Japanese shortwave broadcasts emanating from military headquarters in Tokyo, and all purveyed the straight Japanese propaganda line. One story in particular infuriated the hushed group in the Sakagawa living room: “American Marines Confess Stabbing Helpless Japanese Soldiers with Bayonets.” The story came from Tokyo and could not be doubted.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the horror at American brutality subsided, Mr. Ishii proceeded with the important news, a story in which the Wyoming editors summarized, by means of Imperial releases, the progress of the war, and it was apparent to all in the little room that Japan was not only triumphing throughout the Pacific but that she must soon invade Hawaii. “And then, Sakagawa-san, what are you going to tell the emperor’s general when he strides ashore at Honolulu and asks, ‘Sakagawa, were you a good Japanese?’ You, with four sons fighting against the emperor. And do you know what the general is going to say when he hears your reply? He’s going to say, ‘Sakagawa, bend down.’ And when you have bent down, the general himself is going to unscabbard his sword and cut off your head.”</p>

  <p class="normal">None of the Sakagawas spoke. They looked at the newspaper dumbly, and Reiko picked out the headlines. It was a paper published openly in Wyoming, it had passed the United States censor, what Mr. Ishii had read from it was true. Japan was winning the war and would soon invade Hawaii. In great pain of conscience Sakagawa-san looked at the paper which he could not read and asked I Reiko-chan, “Is it true?” And his daughter said, “Yes.” It was one of the most exasperating anomalies of the war that whereas the F.B.I. and naval security kept very close watch on the Japanese newspapers in Hawaii, and saw that they printed only the strictest truth, with no stories at all datelined Tokyo, the Japanese-language newspapers in the states of Utah and Wyoming were free to print whatever they wished, it having been decided by the local military that the official Japanese communiques were so ridiculous that they would in time defeat themselves, as indeed they did. So the mainland Japanese press, often edited by die-hard samurai types, kept pouring out an incredible mess of propaganda, rumor, anti-American sentiment and downright subversive lies, and when copies of the papers reached Hawaii, where rumors were apt to be virulent, their effect was shocking.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will tell the emperor’s general,” Sakagawa-san finally explained, “that my sons fought only in Europe. Never against Japan.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will do no good!” Mr. Ishii said sadly. “The emperor will never forgive you for what you have done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sakagawa-san felt weak. He had always had doubts about sending his sons to war, and now the Wyoming paper had fortified those doubts. Dumbly he looked at his old guide, and’ Mr. Ishii, after enjoying the moment of humiliation, finally said, “I will put in a good word for you with the general. I will tell him you have always been a good Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank you, Mr. Ishii!” the dynamiter cried. “You are the only friend I can trust.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Sakagawas went to bed that night in considerable torment, so the next day at her barber chair Reiko waited until an intelligent-looking young naval officer sat down, and when he had done so, she asked quietly, “Could you help me, please.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure,” the officer said. “Name’s Jackson, from Seattle.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A man told me last night that Japan might invade Hawaii at any moment. Is that true?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The navy man’s jaw dropped; he pulled the towel away from his neck and turned to look at Reiko, who was then twenty-six and at her prettiest. He smiled at her and asked, “Good God, woman! What have you been hearing?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was told on good authority that Japanese ships might attack at any time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, lady!” the officer chided. “If you’re a spy trying to get secrets . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Reiko blushed. Then she saw her father approaching to enforce the rule against any conversation with customers. She retied the towel, jerking it back to muzzle the navy man, and started clipping. “We’re not allowed to talk,” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where do you have lunch?” the officer asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Senaga’s,” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll see you there, and tell you about the war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, I couldn’t!” Reiko blushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, I’m from Seattle. I used to know lots of Japanese girls. Senaga’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the counter of the restaurant, run by the Okinawa pig-grower Senaga, Lieutenant Jackson surprised Reiko by ordering sushi and sashimi, which he attacked with chopsticks. “I served in Japan,” he said. “If my skipper caught me eating with chopsticks I’d be court-martialed. Unpatriotic.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We all try to eat with forks,” Reiko said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now about this Jap invasion,” Jackson said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would you please not call us Japs?” Reiko asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re Japanese,” Jackson laughed easily. “The enemy are Japs. What’s your first name? Reiko, that’s nice. Well, Reiko-chan . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where did you learn Reiko-chan?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In Japan,” he replied casually.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you ever know a Reiko-chan?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I knew a Kioko-chan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long silence as they ate sushi, and Reiko wanted to ask many questions and Lieutenant Jackson wanted to make many comments, but neither spoke, until at the same moment Reiko pushed her fork toward the sashimi and the officer shoved his chopsticks at the raw fish. There was a clatter and laughter and Jackson said, “I was deeply in love with Kioko-chan, and she taught me some Japanese, and that’s why I have my present job.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it?” Reiko asked solemnly, her face flushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because I speak a little of your language . . . Well, you understand, I’m not really a navy officer. I’m a Seattle lawyer. I’m with the Adjutant General and my job is to visit Japanese families and tell them that their daughters should not marry American G.I.’s. I see about twenty families a week . . . You know how American men are, they see pretty girls and they want to marry ‘em. My job is to see that they don’t.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly he broke his chopsticks in half and his knuckles grew white with bitterness. “Each week, Reiko-chan, I see about twenty Japanese girls’ and argue with them, and every goddamned one of them reminds me of Kioko-chan, and pretty soon I’m going to go nuts.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked straight ahead, a man squeezed in a great vise, and he had no more appetite. Reiko, being a practical girl, finished the sashimi and said, “I must go back to work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you have lunch with me tomorrow?” the officer said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” she said, but when he started to accompany her to the street, she gasped and said, “My father would die.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does he believe the Japanese fleet is coming soon?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not he,” she lied, “but his friend. What is the truth?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In one year or two we will destroy Japan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Reiko-chan advised her father that there must be something wrong with the Wyoming newspaper, because Japan was not winning the war, but this infuriated Sakagawa-san, who had brought home a second copy of the Prairie Shinbun, more inflammatory than the first, and as Reiko patiently read it to him she herself began to wonder: “Who is telling the truth?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then proof came. President Roosevelt arrived in Honolulu aboard a naval ship, and the Sakagawas saw him with their own eyes and marked the way in which he rode through Honolulu, protected by dozens of secret-service men. To Sakagawa-san, this proved that America was strong, but he had not reckoned with Mr. Ishii’s superior intellect, for scarcely had the long black automobiles sped by when the excited little man rushed into the barbershop with staggering news.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Didn’t I tell you?” he whispered. “Oh, tremendous! Come to Sakai’s immediately.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sakagawa turned the barbershop over to his daughter and slipped down a side street to Sakai’s store, entering by a back door so as not to attract attention, for groups of Japanese were still prevented from assembling. In the back room Sakai, Mr. Ishii and several agitated older men stood discussing the exciting news. For a moment Sakagawa could not comprehend what it was all about, but soon Mr. Ishii explained everything.</p>

  <p class="normal">“President Roosevelt has come to Hawaii on his way to Tokyo. He’s going to surrender peacefully, be executed at the Yasukuni Shrine as a common war criminal, and the Japanese navy will be here in three days.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mr. Ishii’s stories always featured specific details and dates, and one would have thought that after a while his listeners would recall that for three years not one of his predictions had come to pass; but the hope of victory was so strong in the hearts of some of his audience that he was never called to task for his errors. “In three days!” he said. “Ships of the Imperial navy steaming into Pearl Harbor. But I will protect you, Sakagawa-san, and I will ask the emperor to forgive you for sending your sons to war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When President Roosevelt left Honolulu for his execution in Tokyo, Mr. Ishii waited in a state of near-collapse for the battleships of his homeland to come steaming in from the west. For three nights he slept on his roof, waiting, waiting, and in the little house in Kakaako, his friend Sakagawa also waited, in trepidation.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the fourth day, when it was apparent that the Imperial navy was going to be temporarily delayed, Mr. Ishii dropped the whole subject and took up instead the rumor printed in the Prairie Shinbun that the Japanese had captured both Australia and New Zealand. He felt, he told the Sakagawas, that it might be a good idea to emigrate to Australia, for under Japanese control there would be good lands for all.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko-chan discussed each of these rumors with Lieutenant Jackson, who listened patiently as the wide-eyed barber disclosed her apprehensions. Always he laughed, and once observed: “This Mr. Ishii must be quite a jerk,” but Reiko apologized for the little man: “He came from Hiroshima long ago and has lived in darkness,” whereupon the naval officer said, “He better watch out what he says. He could get into trouble.” At this Reiko-chan laughed and said, “Nobody ever takes Mr. Ishii seriously. He’s such a sweet, inoffensive little man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It would be difficult to characterize as a love affair a series of meetings conducted in a barbershop under the hawklike eye of Kamejiro Sakagawa and in a crowded Okinawan restaurant run by the Senaga family, for between Reiko-chan and Lieutenant Jackson there were no crushing kisses or lingering farewells, but it was a love affair nevertheless, and on one bold Tuesday, Reiko extended her lunch hour till four in the afternoon, and that sunny day there were both kisses and enraptured embraces. One Wednesday night she slipped away from home and waited for Lieutenant Jackson’s Chevrolet, and they drove out to Diamond Head and parked in a lovers’ lane. Local people called this, “The midnight athletes watching the under-water submarine races under a full moon.” But a shore patrol, inspecting cars, called it country necking, and when they got to the Chevy they were astounded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you doin’ with a Jap, Lieutenant?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Talking.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“With a Jap?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, with a Japanese.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s see your papers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You didn’t ask to see their papers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re with white girls.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With a show of irritation Lieutenant Jackson produced his papers and the shore patrol shook their heads. “This beats anything,” one of the sailors said. “She a local girl?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can you speak English, lady?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, I guess it’s all right, if a naval officer don’t care whether he necks with a Jap or not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look here, buddy . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You want to start something, sir?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Lieutenant Jackson looked up at the two towering sailors and said, “No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We didn’t think so. Good night, Jap-lover.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Lieutenant Jackson sat silent for some minutes, then said, “War is unbelievable. If those two boys live till we get to Tokyo, they’ll probably fall in love with Japanese girls and marry them. With what confusion they will remember this night.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will our men get to Tokyo soon?” Reiko-chan asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">The lieutenant was impressed-by the manner in which she said “our men,” and he asked, “Why did you say it that way?”</p>

  <p class="normal">She replied, “I have four brothers fighting in Europe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have . . .” He stopped and on an uncontrollable impulse jumped out of the car and shouted, “Hey, shore patrol! Shore patrol!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two young policemen hurried back and asked, “What’s the matter, Lieutenant? She turn out to be a spy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Fellows, I want you to meet Miss Reiko Sakagawa. She has four brothers fighting in the American army in Italy. While you and I sit on our fat asses here in Hawaii. When you were here before, I didn’t know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You got four men in the war?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” she replied quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All army?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Japanese aren’t allowed in the navy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am,” one of the shore patrol said, a boy from Georgia, “I sure hope your brothers get home safe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good night, miss,” the other boy said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Night, fellows,” Jackson muttered, and when the patrol wheeled down the road he stammered, “Reiko-chan, I think we ought to get married.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She sighed, clasped her hands very tightly, and said, “I thought your job was to keep men like you from marrying girls like me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is, but have you ever noticed the way in which people in such jobs always fall prey to the very thing they are fighting against? It’s uncanny. I’ve intervened in some three hundred cases like this, and almost every time the man has been from the Deep South.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What has that to do with us?” Reiko-chan asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You see, at home these Southern boys have been taught from birth that anyone with a different color is evil and to be despised. In their hearts they know this can’t be true, so as soon as they get a fair chance to investigate a girl with a different color, they find a human being and they suffer a compulsion to fall in love and marry her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you from the South, Lieutenant? Do you act from such a compulsion?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m from Seattle, but I have a compulsion greater than any of them. After Pearl Harbor my father, a pretty good man by and large, was the one who spearheaded the drive to throw all Japanese into concentration camps. He knew he was doing an evil thing. He knew he was giving false testimony and acting for his own economic advantage. But nevertheless, he went ahead. On the night he made his inflammatory speech over the radio I told him, Top, you know what you said isn’t true,’ and he replied, ‘This is war, son.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So you want to marry me to get even with him?” Reiko asked. “I couldn’t marry you on those terms.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The compulsion is much deeper, Reiko-chan. Remember that I lived in Japan. No matter how old we both get, Reiko, never forget that at the height of the war I told you, ‘When peace comes, Japan and America will be compatible friends.’ I am positive of it. I am positive that my father, since he is essentially a good man, will welcome you graciously as his daughter. Because people have got to forget past errors. They have got to bind separated units together.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You talk as if your father were the problem,” Reiko said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean yours is?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will never get married,” Reiko said sorrowfully. “My father would never permit it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell your father to go to hell. I told mine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I am a Japanese,” she said, kissing him on the lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro Sakagawa first discovered his daughter’s love affair with a haole when his good friend Sakai appeared at the barbershop one morning to say, “I am sorry, Kamejiro, but my daughter cannot work here any more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sakagawa gasped and asked, “Why not? I pay her well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, and we need the money, but I can’t risk having her work here another day. It might happen to her too. So many haoles coming in here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What might happen?” Sakagawa stammered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“More better we go outside,” Sakai said. There, along a gutter on Hotel Street, he said sorrowfully, “You have been a good friend, Kamejiro, and you have paid our girl well, but we cannot run the risk of her falling in love with a haole man, the way your Reiko has.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Little bulldog Kamejiro, his neck muscles standing out, grabbed his friend by the shoulders, rising on his toes to accomplish the feat. “What are you saying?” he roared.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kamejiro,” his friend protested, trying vainly to break loose from the frightening grip. “Ask anyone. Your daughter has lunch every day with the American … at Senaga’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In a state of shock, little Kamejiro Sakagawa thrust his friend away and stared down Hotel Street at the Okinawa restaurant run by the pig-farmer, Senaga, and as he watched, that crafty Senaga entered the shop, taking with him a haole friend, and in this simple omen Sakagawa saw the truth of what his compatriot Sakai had charged. Reiko-chan, as good a daughter as a man ever had, strong and dutiful, had been visiting with a haole in an Okinawan restaurant. Shattered, the stocky little man, then sixty-one, leaned against a post, oblivious of the flow of sailors and soldiers about him.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was ironic, he thought, that war should have catapulted two of the groups he hated most into such postures of success. The damned Chinese had all the good jobs at Pearl Harbor, and with the income they got, were buying up most of Honolulu. Their sons were not at war, and their arrogance was high. As allies, followers of the damnable Chiang Kai-shek, who had resisted decent Japanese overtures in China, they appeared in all the parades arid made speeches over the radio. The Chinese, Sakagawa reflected that ugly morning, were doing very well.</p>

  <p class="normal">But what was particularly galling was that the Okinawans were doing even better. Now, an Okinawan, Sakagawa mused in sullen anger as he studied Senaga’s restaurant, is a very poor man to begin with, neither wholly Japanese nor wholly Chinese, but making believe to be the former. An Okinawan cannot be trusted, must be watched every minute lest he set his daughters to trick a man’s sons, and is a man who lacks the true Japanese spirit. There were few men in the world, Sakagawa felt, lower than an Okinawan, yet look at what happened to them during the war!</p>

  <p class="normal">Because in the years before 1941 they had not been accepted into Japanese society, they had banded together. Most of the garbage in Honolulu was collected by Okinawans. To get rid of the garbage they kept pigs, hundreds upon hundreds of pigs. So when the war came, and freighters were no longer available to carry fresh beef from California to Hawaii, where did everyone have to go for meat? To the Okinawans? Who opened up one restaurant after another, because they had the meat? The Okinawans! Who was going to come out of the war richer than even the white people? The Okinawans! It was a cruel jest, that an Okinawan should wind up rich and powerful and respected, just because he happened to own all the pigs.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was with these thoughts that the little dynamiter, Kamejiro Sakagawa, hid among the crowd on Hotel Street and waited to spy upon his daughter Reiko, and as he waited he muttered to himself, “With a haole, in an Okinawan restaurant!” It was really more than ¥he could comprehend.</p>

  <p class="normal">At five minutes after twelve Lieutenant Jackson entered the restaurant and took a table which smiling Senaga-san had been reserving for him. The officer ordered a little plate of pickled radishes, which he ate deftly with chopsticks, and Sakagawa thought: “What’s he doing eating tsukemono? With hashi?”</p>

  <p class="normal">At ten minutes after twelve Reiko Sakagawa hurried into the restaurant, and even a blind man could have seen from the manner in which she smiled and the way in which her whole eager body bent forward that she was in love. She did not touch the naval officer, but her radiant face and glowing eyes came peacefully to rest a few inches from his. With a fork she began picking up a few pieces of radish, and her father, watching from the street, thought: “It’s all very confusing. What is she doing with a fork?”</p>

  <p class="normal">During the entire meal the little Japanese watched the miserable spectacle of his daughter having a date with a haole, and long before she was ready to leave, Kamejiro had hastened back down Hotel Street to his friend Sakai’s store, asking, “Sakai, what shall I do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you see for yourself?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. What you said is true.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hasegawa is taking his daughter out of the barbershop, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To hell with the barbershop! What shall I do about Reiko?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What you must do, Kamejiro, is find out who this haole is. Then go to the navy and ask that he be transferred.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would the navy listen to me?” Kamejiro pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“On such a matter, yes,” Sakai said with finality. Then he added, “But your most important job, Kamejiro, is to find a husband for your daughter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For years I have been looking,” the little dynamiter said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will act as the go-between,” Sakai promised. “But it will not be easy. Now that she has ruined herself with a haole.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! Don’t say that. Reiko-chan is a good girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But already everyone knows she has been going with a haole. What self-respecting Japanese family will accept her now, Kamejiro?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you work hard as the go-between, Sakai?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will find a husband for your daughter. A decent Japanese man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are my friend,” Sakagawa said tearfully, but before he left he added prudently, “Sakai, could you please try to find a Hiroshima man? That would be better.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Sakagawa had spent the morning at home making pickled cabbage and the afternoon at Mrs. Mark Whipple’s rolling Red Cross bandages. The latter experience had been a trying one, for every woman in the room had at least one son in the Two-Two-Two except Mrs. Whipple, and her husband commanded it. Therefore, the conversation, which most of the Japanese women could not participate in, had to be about the war in Italy and the heavy casualties which the Japanese boys were suffering, but whenever grief began to stalk the room, Mrs. Whipple, one of the Hale girls, invariably brought up some new and cheering fact. Once she said, “President Roosevelt himself has announced that our boys are among the bravest that have fought under the Stars and Stripes.” Later she said, “Time magazine this week reports that when our boys reached Salerno on leave, the other troops at the railway station cheered them as they disembarked.” Mrs. Whipple always referred to the Japanese soldiers as “our boys,” and other haoles in Hawaii were beginning to do the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">So the afternoon had been, an emotional one, regardless of whether the talk was of casualties or of triumphs, and Mrs. Sakagawa, whose feet were sore from the American shoes she felt obligated to wear, reached home eager for rest. Instead, she found her husband at home rather than in the barbershop, and she knew that something dire had happened. Before she could ask, Kamejiro shouted, “A fine daughter you raised! She’s in love with a haole!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The words were the harshest that Mrs. Sakagawa could have heard. There were some Japanese girls, she had to admit, who went openly with haoles, but they were not from self-respecting families, and there were a few who under the pressure of war had become prostitutes, but she suspected that these were really either Etas or Okinawans. It was unlikely that any Japanese girl, mindful of the proud blood that flowed in her veins . . .</p>

  <p class="normal">“And Sakai took his daughter out of the barbershop lest she become contaminated too, and Hasegawa is removing his daughter tomorrow.” He was about to cry, “We are ruined,” but an even deeper concern overcame him, and he fell into a chair, sinking his head on his forearms and sobbing, “Our family has never known shame before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Sakagawa, who refused to believe that her daughter could have brought disgrace upon the family, kicked off her American shoes, wriggled her toes in comfort, and kneeled beside her distraught husband. “Kamejiro,” she whispered, “we taught Reiko how to be a good Japanese. I am sure she will not disgrace us. Somebody has told you a great lie.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Violently the little dynamiter thrust his wife aside and strode across the room. “I saw them! She was almost kissing him in public. And I’ve been thinking. Where was she that afternoon she said she didn’t feel well? Out with a haole. And where was she when she said she was going to a cinema? Riding in a dark car with a haole. I heard a car stop that night, but I was too stupid to put two and two together.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment Reiko-chan, flushed with love and the brisk walk home, entered and saw immediately from her parents’ faces that her secret had been discovered. Her father said simply, with a heartbreaking gasp, “My own daughter! With a haole!” Her mother was still ready to dismiss the whole scandal and asked, “It isn’t true, is it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko-chan, her dark eyes warm with the inner conviction that was to sustain her through the impending argument, replied, “I am in love, and I want to get married.”</p>

  <p class="normal">No one spoke. Kamejiro fell back into a chair and buried his face. Mrs. Sakagawa stared at her daughter in disbelief and then began, to treat her with exaggerated solicitude, as if she were already illegally pregnant. Reiko smiled in quiet amusement, but then her stricken father gave an appalling gasp, and she knelt beside him, saying quickly, “Lieutenant Jackson is a wonderful man, Father. He’s understanding, and he’s lived in Japan. He has a good job in Seattle, but he thinks he may settle here after the war.” She hesitated, for her words were not being heard, and then added, “Wherever he goes, I want to go with him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly her father pushed himself back from the table, withdrew from his daughter, and looked at her in shocked disbelief. “But you are a Japanese!” he cried in his misery.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to marry him, Father,” his daughter repeated forcefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you’re a Japanese,” he reiterated. Taking her hand he said, “You have the blood of Japan, the strength of a great nation, everything . . .” He tried to explain how unthinkable her suggestion was, but could come back to only one paramount fact. “You’re a Japanese!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko explained patiently, “Lieutenant Jackson is a respectable man. He has a much better job than any man here that I might possibly marry. He’s a college graduate and has a good deal of money in the bank. His family is well known in, Seattle. These things aren’t of major importance, but I tell you so that you will realize what an unusual man he is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro listened in disgust at the rigamarole, and when it seemed likely that Reiko was going to add more, he slapped her sharply across the cheek. “It would be humiliating,” he cried. “A permanent disgrace. Already even the rumor of your behavior has ruined the barbershop. The Sakai girl has quit. So has the Hasegawa. No self-respecting Japanese family will want to associate with us after what you have done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko pressed her hand to her burning cheek and said quietly, “Father, hundreds of decent Japanese girls have fallen in love with Americans.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whores, all of them!” Kamejiro stormed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ignoring him Reiko said, “I know, because that’s Lieutenant Jackson’s job. To talk with parents like you. And the girls are not . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Aha!” Kamejiro cried. “So that’s what he does! Tomorrow I go see Admiral Nimitz.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Father, I warn you that if you . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Admiral Nimitz will hear of this!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The little dynamiter did not actually get to Nimitz. He was stopped first by an ensign, who was so enthralled by the stalwart, bow-armed Japanese that he passed him along to a full lieutenant who sent him on to a commodore who burst into the office of a rear admiral, with the cry: “Jesus, Jack! There’s a little Japanese out here with the goddamnedest story you ever heard. You gotta listen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So a circle of captains, commodores and admirals interrupted their work to listen to Kamejiro’s hilarious pidgin as he protested to the navy that one of their officers had wrecked his barbershop and had ruined his daughter.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is she pregnant?” one of the rear admirals asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You watch out!” Kamejiro cried. “Mo bettah you know Reiko a good wahine!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sorry, Mr. Sakagawa. In our language ruined means, well, ruined.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the officers heard who it was that ruined, or whatever, the girl Reiko, they almost exploded. “That goddamned Jackson!” one of them sputtered. “His job is to break up this sort of thing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve told you a dozen times,” another said. “Putting a civilian into uniform doesn’t make him an officer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s beside the point,” the senior admiral said. “What I’d like to know, Mr. Sakagawa, is this. If the boy has a good reputation, a good job, a good income, and a good family back in Seattle . . . Well, what I’m driving at is this. Your daughter is a lady barber. It would seem to me that you would jump at the chance for such a marriage.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Little Kamejiro, who was shorter by nine inches than any man in the room, stared at them in amazement. “She’s a Japanese!” he said to the interpreter. “It would be disgraceful if she married a haole.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How’s that?” the commodore asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It would bring such shame on our family . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What the hell do you mean?” the commodore bellowed. “Since when is a Jap marrying a decent American a matter of shame . . . to the Jap?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Her brothers in Italy would be humiliated before all their companions,” Kamejiro doggedly explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s that again?” the senior officer asked. “She got brothers in Italy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My four boys are fighting in Italy,” Kamejiro said humbly.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the rear admirals rose and came over to the little dynamiter. “You have four sons in the Two-Two-Two?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They all in Italy?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long silence, broken by the admiral, who said, “I got one son there. I worry about him all the time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am worried about my daughter,” the stubborn little man replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And if she marries a white man, her four brothers won’t be able to live down the disgrace?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you want Admiral Nimitz to do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Send Lieutenant Jackson away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He will go away this afternoon,” the admiral said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“May God bless Admiral Nimitz,” Kamejiro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s an odd phrase,” the admiral said. “You a Christian?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m Buddhist. But my children are all Christian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kamejiro had been led outside, happy at the ease with which he had found a solution to his grave problem, the admiral shrugged his shoulders and said, “We’ll beat the little bastards, but we’ll never understand them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko-chan never saw Lieutenant Jackson again. In conformance with secret and high-priority orders he flew out of Hawaii that night, exiled to Bougainville, where, less than a week later, a body of Japanese infiltrators slipped through the jungle, attacked the headquarters in which he was serving, and lunged at him with bayonets. Knowing nothing of guns, the young lawyer tried to fight them off with a chair, but one Japanese soldier parried the chair, drove his bayonet through the lieutenant’s chest, and left him strangling to death in the mud.</p>

  <p class="normal">No one told Reiko that her lawyer was dead—there was no reason why anyone should—and she assumed that he had been fooling with her as men will, and that he had gone to other duties. When her father’s barbershop had to close, because cautious Japanese families would not allow their daughters to work under a man who did not even protect his own daughter from the disgrace of a haole love affair, Reiko went to work in another barbershop, and sometimes when a naval officer came in for a haircut, and she placed the towel about his neck and saw the railroad-track insignia on his shirt, she would for a moment feel dizzy. At other times, when brash enlisted men tried to feel her legs as she cut their hair, she would jab their hands with her scissors, as her father had taught her to do, but even as she did so, she felt confused by the great passion that can exist between men and women.</p>

  <p class="normal">The forced closing of Kamejiro Sakagawa’s barbershop was actually a considerable blessing to the family, although at the time it was not so recognized, for in the first weeks the stalwart little dynamiter could find no work other than caring for lawns, a job he did not like. Then the Okinawan restaurant keeper Senaga sent a messenger saying that he needed a busboy at a new restaurant he was opening in Waikiki, where a great many soldiers and sailors went, and he would like Sakagawa-san to take the job. Kamejiro’s eyes blazed as he stared at the messenger. “If Senaga had been a friend, he would never have allowed a Japanese girl to talk with a haole in his restaurant. Tell him no.” But to his wife, Kamejiro swore, “I would rather die of starvation than work for an Okinawan.” Then, from a totally unexpected source, the Sakagawas received the financial aid which established them as one of the stronger and more prosperous Japanese families in Hawaii. It all happened because early in 1943 – Hong Kong Kee had made a speech.</p>

  <p class="normal">The inflamed oratory which provoked the loan took place before the Japanese boys of the Two-Two-Two had become the popular heroes they were later to be. When Hong Kong spoke, Japanese were still suspect, and a haole committee, seeking to whip up patriotism for war bonds, prevailed upon him to give a short speech explaining why the Chinese could be trusted and the Japanese could not. Since the committee of patriots contained many of the leaders of Honolulu, Hong Kong was naturally flattered by the invitation and spent some time in working out a rather fiery comparison of Chinese virtues as opposed to Japanese duplicity. Then, when he got on the speakers’ platform, he became intoxicated by the crowd and deviated from his script, making his remarks rather more inclusive than he had planned. “The Japanese war lords have oppressed China for many years,” he cried, “and it is with joy in our hearts that we watch the great American forces driving the evil Japanese from places where they have no right to be.” He was astonished at the constant applause which the mass meeting threw back at him, and thus emboldened, he extended his remarks to include the Japanese in Hawaii. It was a very popular speech, sold a lot of war bonds, and got Hong Kong’s picture in the papers under the caption “Patriotic Chinese Leader Flays Japs.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The affair was a big success except in one house. In her small, ugly clapboard shack up the Nuuanu, Hong Kong’s grandmother, then ninety-six years old, listened appalled as one of her great-granddaughters read aloud the account of Hong Kong’s oratory. “Bring him here at once!” she stormed, and when the powerful banker stood in her room she sent the others away, and when the door was closed she rose, stalked over to her grandson and slapped him four times in the face. “You fool!” she cried. “You fool! You damned, damned fool!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hong Kong fell back from the assault and covered his face to prevent further slappings. When he did this his fiery little grandmother began pushing him in the chest, calling him all the while “You fool!” until he stumbled backward against a chair and fell into it. Then she stopped, waited for him to drop his hands, and stared at him sorrowfully. “Hong Kong,” she said, “yesterday you were a great fool.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” he asked weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">She showed him the paper, with his picture grinning out from a semicircle of haole faces, and although she could not read, she could remember what her great-granddaughter had reported, and now she repeated the phrases with icy sarcasm: “We cannot trust the Japanese!” She spat onto her own floor. “They are deceitful and criminal men.” Again she spat. Then she threw the paper onto the floor and kicked it, for her fury was great, and when this was done she shouted at her grandson, “What glory did you get from standing for a few minutes among the haoles?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was asked to represent the Chinese community,” Hong Kong fumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who appointed you our representative, you stupid man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought that since we are fighting Japan, somebody ought to . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You didn’t think!” Nyuk Tsin stormed. “You have no brains to think. For a minute’s glory, standing among the haoles, you have destroyed every good chance the Chinese have built up for themselves in Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait a minute, Auntie!” Hong Kong protested. “That’s exactly what I was thinking about when I agreed to make the speech. It was a chance to make the Chinese look better among the haoles who run the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nyuk Tsin looked at her grandson in amazement. “Hong Kong?” she gasped. “Do you think that when the war is over, the haoles will continue to run Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They have the banks, the newspapers . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hong Kong! Who is doing the fighting? What men are in uniform? Who is going to come back to the islands ready to take over the political control? Tell me, Hong Kong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean the Japanese?” he asked weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes!” she shouted, her Hakka anger at its peak. “That’s exactly who I mean. They are the ones who will win this war, and believe me, Hong Kong, when they take control they will remember the evil things you said yesterday, and every Kee in Honolulu will find life a little more difficult because of your stupidity.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t mean that . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Be still, you stupid man. After the war when Sam wants to build a store, who will sign the papers giving him the permit? Some Japanese. If Ruth’s husband wants to run a bus line, who will give the permit? Some Japanese. And they will hate you for what you said yesterday. Already your words have been filed in their minds.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The shadow of a government building where all the permit signers were Japanese fell heavily upon Hong Kong, and he asked, “What ought we to do?” It was symptomatic of the Kees that when one of them took a bold step, he said of himself, “I did this,” but when corrective measures had to be taken, he always consulted Wu Chow’s Auntie and asked, “What must we do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old woman said, “You must go through Honolulu and apologize to every Japanese you have ever known. Humble yourself, as you should. Then find at least twenty men who need money, and lend it to them. Help them start new businesses.” She stopped, then added prudently, “It would be better if you lent the money to those who have a lot of sons in the war, for they will be the ones who are going to run Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the course of his apologies to the Japanese community, Hong Kong came in time to Sakai, the storekeeper, and Sakai said in English, “No, I don’t need any money, but my good friend Sakagawa the dynamiter has lost his barbershop, and he needs money to start a store of some kind.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where can I find him?” Hong. Kong asked. “He lives in Kakaako.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“By the way, any of his boys in the Two-Two-Two?” “Four,” Sakai replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will look him up,” Hong Kong replied, and that afternoon he told Kamejiro, “I have come to apologize for what I said at the meeting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mo bettah you be ashamed,” Kamejiro said bluntly. “Yes, with you having four sons in the battles.” “And all other Japanese, too.” “Kamejiro, I’m sorry.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I sorry for you,” the stocky little Japanese said, for he did not like Chinese.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And I have come to lend you the money to start a store here in Kakaako.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kamejiro drew back, for he had learned that anything either a Chinese or an Okinawan did was sure to be tricky. Surveying Hong Kong, he asked, “What for you lend me money?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Humbly Hong Kong replied, “Because I’ve got to prove I am really sorry.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in this way that Kamejiro Sakagawa opened his grocery store, and because he was a frugal man and worked incredibly hard, and because his wife had a knack of waiting on Japanese customers and his barber daughter a skill in keeping accounts, the store flourished. Then, as if good fortune had piled up a warehouse full of beneficences, on New Year’s Day, 1944, Sakai-san came running with breathless news.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Pssst!” he called to Sakagawa as the latter sprayed his vegetables. “Come here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” the grocer shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Out here!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sakagawa left the store and allowed Sakai-san to lead him to an alley, where the latter said in awed tones, “I have found a husband for your daughter!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have?” Sakagawa cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes! A wonderful match!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A Japanese, of course?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Sakai looked at his old friend with contempt. “What kind of baishakunin would I be if I even thought of proposing anyone but a Japanese?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Forgive me!” Sakagawa said. “You can understand, after the narrow escape we had.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This man is perfect. A little house. More than a little money. Fine Japanese. And what else do you think!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he . . .” Sakagawa would not form the words, for this was too much to hope for.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes! He’s also a Hiroshima man!”</p>

  <p class="normal">A thick blanket of positive euphoria settled over the two whispering men, for the go-between Sakai was just as pleased as Sakagawa that a fine Japanese girl had at last found a good husband, and a Hiroshima man at that. Finally Sakagawa got round to a question of lesser importance: “Who is he?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Ishii!” Sakai cried rapturously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Has he agreed to marry my daughter?” Kamejiro asked incredulously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes!” Sakai the baishakunin cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does he know about her . . . the haole?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course. I was honor-bound to tell him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And still he is willing to accept her?” Kamejiro asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, he says it is his duty to save her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That good man,” Sakagawa cried. He called his wife and told her, “Sakai has done it! He has found a husband for Reiko-chan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who?” his practical-minded wife asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Ishii!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A Hiroshima man!” And before Reiko-chan knew anything of her impending marriage, word that she had found a Hiroshima man flashed through the Japanese community and almost everybody was truly delighted with the girl’s good fortune, especially since she had been mixed up with a haole man, but one girl, who had been through high school, reflected: “Mr. Ishii must be thirty-five years older than Reiko.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What does it matter?” her mother snapped. “She’s getting a Hiroshima man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko was in the barbershop on Hotel Street cutting the hair of a sailor when the news reached her. The girl at the next chair whispered in Japanese, “Congratulations, dear Reiko-chan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“About what?” Reiko asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sakai-san has found you a husband.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Japanese phrase fell strangely on Reiko’s ears, for although she had long suspected that her parents had employed a baishakunin to find her a husband, she had never supposed that any solid arrangement would come to pass. Steadying herself against her chair, she asked casually, “Who did they say the man was?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Ishii! I think it’s wonderful.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko-chan kept mechanically moving her fingers, and the man in the chair warned: “Not too much off the sides, ma’am.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sorry,” Reiko said. She wanted to run out of the barbershop, far from everyone, but she kept to her job. Patiently she trimmed the sailor’s head just right, then lathered his neck and sideburns and asked, “You like them straight or on a little slant?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Any way looks best,” the young man said. “You speak good English. Better’n me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I went to school,” Reiko said quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am, do you feel well?” the sailor asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You don’t look so good. Look, ma’am . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reiko was about to faint, but with a tremendous effort she controlled herself and finished the lathering; but when she tried to grasp the razor she could not command it, and with great dismay she looked at the frightened sailor and asked softly, “Would you mind if I did not shave your neck this time? I feel dizzy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am, you ought to lie down,” the sailor said, wiping the soap from his sideburns.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he left, Reiko hung up her apron and announced, “I am going home,” and on the long walk to Kakaako she tried not to compare Mr. Ishii with Lieutenant Jackson, but she could not keep her mind from doing so; then as she approached the family store she fortified herself with this consoling thought: “He’s a crazy little man, and more like my father than a husband, but he is a proper Japanese and my father will be happy.” Thinking no more of her absent Seattle lawyer, who had never even written to her, she went into the Sakagawa store, walked up to her father, and bowed. “I am grateful to you, Father.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is a Hiroshima man!” Sakagawa pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the wedding, which was a highlight of the Japanese community in February of 1944, the baishakunin Sakai commanded everything. He told the family where to stand and the priest what to do and the groom how to behave. Mr. Ishii had spent the first part of the afternoon showing the assembly the latest copy of the Prairie Shinbun, which proved that valiant Imperial troops had finally driven all American marines off Guadalcanal and were about to launch a major invasion of Hawaii. One guest, who had two sons in Italy, whispered to his wife, “I think the old man’s crazy!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ssssh!” his wife said. “He’s getting married.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the crush was greatest, Reiko-chan, in old-style Japanese dress, happened to look at her bridegroom for the first time since her engagement had been announced, and she could not hide from herself the fact that he was a pathetic, cramped-up old man; and all her American education inspired her to flee from this insane ceremony, and great dizziness came upon her and she said to one of the girls near her, “This obi is too tight, I must get some air,” and she was about to run away when the baishakunin Sakai cried, “We begin!” and the intricate, lovely Japanese wedding ceremony proceeded.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it ended, women clustered about Reiko-chan and told her, “You were beautiful in your kimono. A true bride, with flushed cheeks and downcast eyes.” Others said, “It’s so wonderful to think that he is also a Hiroshima man.” And the crush became so oppressive that she said, “This obi is really too tight. I must get some air,” and she left the wedding feast and went alone to the porch, where she began to breathe deeply and where she arrived just in time to greet a messenger boy riding up on a bicycle.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the next moment the guests inside heard a series of screams emanating from the porch, as if an animal had been mortally wounded, and they rushed out to find Reiko-chan screaming and screaming, and they could not stop her, for in her hand she held a message from the War Department advising the Sakagawa family of certain events that had recently transpired on a river bank in Italy.</p>

  <p class="normal">ON <span>SEPTEMBER</span> 22, 1943, the Triple Two looked forward across the bow of their transport and saw rising in the misty dawn the hills of Italy, and Sergeant Goro Sakagawa thought: “I’ll bet there’s a German division hiding in there, waiting for us to step ashore.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was right, and as the Japanese boys climbed down out of their transport to invade the beaches of Salerno, German planes and heavy artillery tried to harass them, but their aim was wild and all the units made it without casualty except one crop-headed private named Tashimoto, who sprained his ankle. The gang passed the word along with the acid comment, “Wouldn’t you know it would be a guy from Molokai?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Salerno lay southeast of Naples and had been chosen because it provided a logical stepping-off place for an encircling movement on Rome, some hundred and fifty miles distant, and on the day of landing, the Two-Two-Two started the long march north. The Germans, knowing both of their coming and of their composition, were determined to halt them. A specific order had been issued by Hitler: “To defeat the little yellow men who are traitors to our ally Japan and who are being cruelly used as propaganda by their Jewish masters in America, is obligatory. If these criminal little men should win a victory, it would be strongly used against us. They must be stopped and wiped out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Japanese boys from Hawaii did not know of this order, and after they had met one line of massive German resistance after another, they concluded: “These krauts must be the best fighters in the world. This is a lot tougher than they told us it was going to be.” If the Two-Two-Two gained three miles, they did so against the most formidable German resistance: mines killed boys from Maui, tanks overran fighters from Molokai; gigantic shells exploded among troops from Kauai; and dogged, powerful ground forces contested every hill. Casualties were heavy, and the Honolulu Mail began carrying death lists with names like Kubokawa, Higa, and Moriguchi.</p>

  <p class="normal">The furious efforts of the Germans to halt and humiliate the Japanese boys had an opposite effect to the one Hitler wanted; Allied war correspondents, both European and American, quickly discovered that whereas other fronts might not produce good stories, one could always get something exciting with the Two-Two-Two because they were the ones that were encountering the best the enemy could provide. Ernie Pyle, among others, marched for some days with the Hawaii troops, and wrote: “I have come to expect our American boys to continue fighting in the face of great odds, but these short, black-eyed little fighters are setting a new record. They continue slugging it out when even the bravest men would consolidate or withdraw. They form a terrific addition to our team, and dozens of boys from Texas and Massachusetts have told me, ‘I’m glad they’re on our side.’ ” So Hitler’s determination to hit the Japanese so hard that they would be forced to collapse in shame, backfired because they fought on in glory.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once Ernie Pyle asked Goro Sakagawa, “Sergeant, why did you push on against that cluster of houses? You knew it was crowded with Germans.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro replied in words that became famous both in Italy and America: “We had to. We fight double. Against the Germans and for every Japanese in America.” Reported Pyle: “And they’re winning both their wars.”</p>

  <p class="normal">September, October, November, December: the beautiful months, the months of poetry and rhythm, with nights growing colder and the soft mists of Italy turning to frost. How beautiful those months were when the boys from Hawaii first realized that they were as good fighting men as any in the world. “We fight double,” they told themselves, and when they came to some Italian town, bathed in cloudless sunlight, standing forth against the hills like an etching, each tower clear in the bright glare, they attacked with fury and calculation, and bit by bit they drove the Germans back toward Rome. Colonel Whipple, delighted by the showing of his troops and pleased with the good reports they were getting in the American press, nevertheless warned his men: “It can’t go on being as easy as this. Somewhere, the Germans are going to dig in real solid. Then we’ll see if we’re as good as they say.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In early December Hitler sent to the Italian front a fanatical Prussian colonel named Sep Seigl, unusual in that he combined a heritage of Prussian tradition and a loyalty to Naziism. Hitler told him simply, “Destroy the Japanese.” And when he studied his maps he decided, “I shall do it at Monte Cassino.” Colonel Seigl was a bullet-headed young man of thirty-seven whose promotion had been speeded because of his dedication to Hitler, and on three different battlefronts he had proved his capacities. At Monte Cassino he was determined to repeat his earlier performances. The Japanese would be humiliated.</p>

  <p class="normal">So as December waned and as the Two-Two-Two slogged steadfastly up the leg of Italy toward Rome, they picked up many signs that their critical battle was going to be engaged somewhere near the old monastery of Monte Cassino, and belts tightened as they approached it. At the same time, from the north Colonel Sep Seigl was moving down to Cassino some of the ablest German units in Italy, but he did not intend to engage the Japanese on the slopes of the mountain. His troops were not permitted to construct their forward positions on that formidable pile of rock; they were kept down below along the banks of the Rapido River that here ran in a north-south direction, with the Japanese approaching from the east and the Germans dug in along the west. Surveying the German might he now had lined up along the Rapido, Colonel Seigl said, “We’ll stop them at the river.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On January 22, 1944, Colonel Mark Whipple halted his Japanese troops along a line one mile east of the Rapido and told them, “Our orders are clear and simple. Cross the river … so that troops behind us can assault that pile of rocks up there. The Germans claim a rabbit can’t get across the approaches without being shot at from six angles. But we’re going across.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He dispatched a scouting party consisting of Sergeant Goro Sakagawa, his brother Tadao, who was good at sketching and four riflemen, and at dusk on the twenty-second of January they crawled out of their hiding places and started on their bellies across the most difficult single battle terrain the Americans were to face in World War II. With meticulous care, Tadao Sakagawa drew maps of the route. Two hundred yards west of their present positions the Two-Two-Two would come upon an irrigation ditch three feet wide and four feet deep. As they crawled out of it, they would be facing German machine guns and a marsh some thirty yards wide, beyond which lay another ditch. Thirty yards beyond hid a third ditch, twice as deep, twice as wide. As the men climbed out of this one, they would face a solid wall of machine-gun fire.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they got this far in the darkness Goro Sakagawa licked his dry lips and asked his men, “What’s that ahead?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Looks like a stone wall.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jesus,” Goro whispered. “You can’t expect our boys to negotiate those three ditches and then climb a wall. How high is it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Looks about twelve feet high.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is impossible,” Goro replied. “You fellows split up. You go that way, we’ll go this. Let’s see if there’s a break in the wall.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the darkness they found none, only a stout, murderous stone wall, twelve feet high and with a jagged top. When they reassembled, Goro said in a rasping whisper, “Christ, how can anybody get over that damned thing? With machine guns everywhere. Sssssh.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a sudden chatter of German guns, but the men firing them must have heard a sound in some other direction, for the firing did not come close to Goro and his men. “Well,” he said when it ceased, “over we go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Patiently and with skill, in the darkness of night, the six Japanese boys helped one another over the terrifying wall, and from it they dropped into the eastern half of the dry river bed of the Rapido. It was about seventy-five feet across, about fifteen feet deep, and every spot of its entire cross section was monitored by German machine guns. On their bellies, the six soldiers crept across the dry river and trusted that no searchlights would be turned on. In the cold night they were perspiring with fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when they got to the other side of the Rapido they discovered what fear really was, for both machine guns and searchlights opened up, but the young Japanese managed to secrete themselves in crevices at the foot of the western bank; but what terrified them was not the imperative staccato of the guns or the probing fingers of lights, but the monstrous nature of the river’s west bank. It rose fairly straight up from the river bed, sixteen feet high, and was topped by a stout double fence of barbed wire which could be expected to contain mines at two-foot intervals.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you getting this on paper?” Goro whispered to Tadao. “Cause when they see this, no general living would dare send men across this river.” A passing light illuminated the wild and terrible tangles of barbed wire and then passed on. “You got it?” Goro asked. “Good. Hoist me up. I’m going through it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tadao grabbed his older brother’s hand. “I have enough maps,” he cautioned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Somebody’s got to see what’s over there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His men hoisted him onto the top of the west bank of the river, where he spent fifteen perilous minutes picking his way inch by inch through the tangled barbed wire. He knew that at any moment he might explode a mine and not only kill himself but doom his five companions as well. He was no longer sweating. He was no longer afraid. He had passed into some extraordinary state known only by soldiers at night or in the heat of unbearable battle. He was a crop-headed, tense-bellied Japanese boy from Kakaako in Honolulu, and the courage he was displaying in those fateful minutes no one in Hawaii would have believed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He penetrated the wire, leaving on the barbs tiny shreds of cloth which would guide him safely back, and in the darkness he found himself on the eastern edge of a dusty road that led past the foot of Monte Cassino. Hiding himself in the ditch that ran alongside the road, he breathed deeply, trying to become a man again and not a nerveless automaton, and as he lay there, face up, a searchlight played across the countryside, hunting for him perhaps, and it passed on and suddenly illuminated the terrain that rose above him, and although he had seen it from a distance and knew its proportions, he now cried with pain: “Oh, Jesus Christ, no!”</p>

  <p class="normal">For above him rose an unassailable rocky height, far, far into the sky, and at its crest clung an ancient monastery, and from where he lay Goro realized that he and his men were expected to cross all that he had seen tonight, and that when they got to this road in which he now huddled, other fellows from Hawaii were expected to forge ahead and climb those overpowering rocks that hung above him. In the lonely darkness he shivered with fright; then, as men do at such times, he effectively blocked out of his mind the realization of what Monte Cassino was like. It was not an unscalable height. It was not mined and interlaced with machine guns. It was not protected by the Rapido River defenses, and a gang of Japanese boys were not required to assault it, with casualties that would have to mount toward the fifty-per-cent mark, or even the eighty. Goro Sakagawa, a tough-minded soldier, cleansed himself of this knowledge and crept back to his men, then back to his commanding officer.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’ll be tough,” he reported. “But it can be done.” As he spoke, Colonel Sep Seigl was reviewing the same terrain and he knew far more about it than Goro Sakagawa, for he had maps prepared by the famous Todt Labor Corps, which had built this ultimate defense of Rome. He could see that the first three ditches which the Japanese would have to cross were covered in every detail by mines and machine-gun fire, and he told his men, “I suppose scouting parties are out there right now, but if they miss the mines, they’ll be lucky.” He saw the plans for defending the river itself, which presented one of the most formidable obstacles any army could encounter, and whereas Goro a few minutes before had been guessing as to where the mines and machine guns were, Seigl knew, and he knew that even his own soldiers, the finest in the world, could not penetrate that defense. And west of the river, of course, lay the exposed road which could be cut to shreds with mortar fire, and beyond that the cliffs of Monte Cassino up which no troops could move. At midnight Colonel Seigl concluded: “They’ll try, but they’ll never make it. Here is where we bloody the nose of the traitor Japanese. Tomorrow we’ll watch them wilt under fire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">January 24, 1944, began with a cold, clear midnight and it was greeted with a thundering barrage of American gunfire which illuminated the bleak river but which did not dislodge the Germans. For forty minutes the barrage continued, and a beginner at warfare might have taken heart, thinking: “No man can live through that.” But the dark-skinned men of the Two-Two-Two knew better; they knew the Germans would be dug in and waiting.</p>

  <p class="normal">At 0040 the barrage stopped and the whistles blew for advance. Goro clutched his brother by the arm and whispered, “This is the big one, kid. Take care of yourself.” Progress to the first ditch was painful, for the Germans launched a counter-barrage and the first deaths at Monte Cassino occurred, but Goro and Tadao pushed stolidly ahead in the darkness, and when they had led their unit across the dangerous ditch and onto the edge of the marsh, they told their captain, “We’ll take care of the mines,” and they set out on their bellies, two brothers who could have been engaged in a tricky football play, and they crawled across the marsh, adroitly cutting the trip wires that would otherwise have detonated mines and killed their companions, and when they reached the second ditch Goro stood up in the night and yelled, “Mo bettah you come. All mines pau!” But as he sent the news his younger brother Tadao, one of the finest boys ever to graduate from Punahou, stepped upon a magnesium mine which exploded with a terrible light, blowing him into a thousand shreds of bone and flesh.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, Jesus!” Goro cried, burying his face in his hands. No action was required. None was possible. Tadao Sakagawa no longer existed in any conceivable form. Not even his shoes were recoverable, but where he had stood other Japanese boys swept over the marshy land and with battle cries leaped into the next ditch, and then into the next.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took five hours of the most brutal fighting imaginable for the Japanese troops to reach the near bank of the Rapido, and when dawn broke, Colonel Sep Seigl was slightly disturbed. “They should not have been able to cross those fields. They seem rather capable, but now the fight begins.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Against the troops for which he had a special hatred he threw a wall of bombardment that was almost unbelievable, and to his relief, the advance was halted. No human being could have penetrated that first awful curtain of shrapnel which greeted the Two-Two-Two at the Rapido itself. “Well,” Colonel Seigl sighed, “at least they’re human. They can be stopped. Now to keep them pinned down. The Japanese cannot absorb casualties. Kill half of them, and the other half will run.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But here Colonel Seigl was wrong. Half of Goro Sakagawa had already been killed; he had loved his clever brother Tadao as only boys who have lived in the close intimacy of poverty and community rejection can love, and now Tadao was dead. Therefore, when the German shelling was at its most intense, Goro said to his captain, “Let’s move across the river. I know how.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll dig in,” the captain countermanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when Colonel Whipple arrived to inspect the battered condition of his men, Goro insisted that the river could be crossed, and Whipple said, “Go ahead and try.” At this point one of the lieutenants from Baker Company, Goro’s commanding officer, and a fine young officer from Kansas, said, “If my men go, I go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right, Lieutenant Shelly,” Whipple said. “We’ve got to cross the river.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Lieutenant Shelly led forty men, with Sergeant Sakagawa as a guide, down into the bed of the Rapido, at nine o’clock on a crystal-clear morning, and they came within six yards of crossing the river, when a titanic German concentration of fire killed half the unit, including Lieutenant Shelly. The twenty who were left began to panic, but Goro commanded sternly, “Up onto that bank and through that barbed wire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a completely insane thing to attempt. The Rapido River did not propose to allow any troops, led by Goro Sakagawa or otherwise, to violate it that day, and when his stubborn muddy fingers reached the barbed-wire embankment, such a furious load of fire bore down upon him that he had to drop back into the river. Three more times he endeavored vainly to penetrate the barbed wire, and each time Colonel Seigl screamed at his men, “Kill him! Kill him! Don’t let them get started!” But although tons of ammunition were discharged in the general direction of Sakagawa and his determined men, somehow they were not killed. Huddling in the protection of the far bank of the river, the gallant twenty waited for their companions to catch up with them, when all together they might have a chance of crashing the barbed wire.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the firepower of the Germans was so intense that the Japanese boys who were still on the eastern bank could not possibly advance. At times the wall of shrapnel seemed almost solid and it would have been complete suicide to move a man into it. “We’ve got to hold where we are,” Colonel Whipple regretfully ordered. “What about those twenty out there in the river?” “Who’s in charge? Lieutenant Shelly?” “He was killed. Sergeant Sakagawa.” “Goro?” “Yes, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’ll get his men out,” Whipple said confidently, and at dusk, after a day of hell, Goro Sakagawa did just that. He brought all of his twenty men back across the river, up the dangerous eastern bank, back through the minefields and safely to headquarters. “Colonel wants to see you,” a major said. “We couldn’t make it,&#160;&#160; Goro reported grimly. “No man ever tried harder, Lieutenant Sakagawa.” Goro showed no surprise at his battlefield commission. He was past fear, past sorrow, and certainly past jubilation. But when the bars were pinned to his tunic by the colonel himself, the rugged sergeant broke into tears, and they splashed out of his dark eyes onto his leathery yellow-brown skin. “Tomorrow we’ll cross the river,” he swore.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll certainly try,” Colonel Whipple said. On January 26 the Japanese troops did try, but once more Colonel Sep Seigl’s able gunners turned them back with dreadful casualties. On January 27 the Japanese tried for the third time, and although Lieutenant Goro Sakagawa got his men onto the road on the other side of the river, they were hit with such pulverizing fire that after forty-five minutes they had to withdraw. That night an Associated Press man wrote one of the great dispatches of the war: “If tears could be transmitted by cable, and printed by linotype, this story would be splashed with tears, for I have at last seen what they call courage beyond the call of duty. I saw a bunch of bandy-legged Japanese kids from Hawaii cross the Rapido River, and hold the opposite bank for more than forty minutes. Then they retreated in utter defeat, driven back by the full might of the German army. Never in victory have I seen any troops in the world achieve a greater glory, and if hereafter any American ever questions the loyalty of our Japanese, I am not going to argue with him. I am going to kick his teeth in.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On January 28, Lieutenant Sakagawa tried for the fourth time to cross the Rapido, and for the fourth time Colonel Sep Seigl’s men mowed the Japanese down. Of the 1,300 troops with which Colonel Whipple had started four days earlier, 779 were now casualties. Dead Japanese bodies lined the fatal river, and men with arms and legs torn off were being moved to the rear. At last it became apparent that the Germans had effectively stopped the advance of the hated Two-Two-Two. That night Colonel Seigl’s intelligence reported: “Victory! The Japanese have been driven back. They’re in retreat and seem to be leaving the line.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The report was partially correct. Lieutenant Goro Sakagawa’s company, and the unit of which it was a part, was being withdrawn. The boys were willing to try again, but they no longer had enough men to maintain a cohesive company and they had to retreat to repair their wounds. As they passed back through a unit from Minnesota coming in to replace them, the Swedes, having heard of their tremendous effort, cheered them and saluted and one man from St. Paul yelled, “We hope we can do as good as you did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will,” a boy from Lahaina mumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">So the Germans stopped the Two-Two-Two … for a few hours, because in another part of the line other units from Hawaii were accumulating a mighty force, and on February 8 Colonel Sep Seigl’s intelligence officer reported breathlessly, “The damned Japanese have crossed the river and are attacking the mountain itself!”</p>

  <p class="normal">With a powerful surge the Japanese boys drove spearheads almost to the top of the mountain. They scaled heights that even their own officers believed impregnable, and they routed out more than two hundred separate machine-gun emplacements. Their heroism in this incredible drive was unsurpassed in World War II, and for a few breathless hours they caught a toehold on the summit of the mountain itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Send us reinforcements!” they radioed frantically. “We’ve got them licked.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But reinforcements could not negotiate the cliffs, and one by one the Japanese victors were driven back from their dizzy pinnacles. As they stumbled down the steep flanks of Monte Cassino the Germans gunned them unmercifully, but at last the fragments of the force staggered back to camp and announced: “The Germans cannot be driven out.” But one fact of triumph remained: the headquarters camp was now on the west bank of the Rapido. The river had been crossed. The way to Rome lay open.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in their bruising defeat at Monte Cassino that the Two-Two-Two became one of the most famous units of the war. “The Purple Heart Battalion” it was called, for it had suffered more casualties than any other similar-sized unit in the war. The Mo Bettahs won more honors, more decorations, more laudatory messages from the President and the generals than any other. But most of all they won throughout America a humble respect. Caucasians who fought alongside them reported back home: “They’re better Americans than I am. I wouldn’t have the guts to do what they do.” And in Hawaii, those golden islands that the Japanese boys loved so deeply as they died in Italy, people no longer even discussed the tormenting old question: “Are the Japanese loyal?” Now men of other races wondered: “Would I be as brave?” So although the Prussian Nazi, Colonel Sep Seigl, did exactly what he had promised Hitler he would do—he crushed the Japanese at Monte Cassino—neither he nor Hitler accomplished what they had initially intended: for it was in defeat that the Japanese boys exhibited their greatest bravery and won the applause of the world.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore it is strange to report that it was not at Monte Cassino that the Two-Two-Two won its greatest laurels. This happened by accident, in a remote corner of France.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the Triple Two’s had retired to a rear area in Italy, there to lick their considerable wounds and to re-form with fresh replacements from the States—including First Lieutenant Goro Sakagawa’s younger brothers Minoru and Shigeo—the Mo Bettah Battalion was shipped out of Italy and into Southern France, where it was allowed to march in a leisurely manner up the Rhone Valley. It met little German opposition, nor was it intended to, for the generals felt that after the heroic performance at Monte Cassino the Japanese boys merited something of a respite, and for once things went as planned. Then accompanied by a Texas outfit that had also built a name for itself in aggressive fighting, the Two-Two-Two’s swung away from the Rhone and entered upon routine mopping-up exercises in the Vosges Mountains, where the easternmost part of France touched the southernmost part of Germany.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Triple Two’s and the Texans moved forward with calculating efficiency until they had the Germans in what appeared to be a final rout. Lieutenant Sakagawa kept urging his men to rip the straggling German units with one effective spur: “Remember what they did to us at Cassino.” Hundreds of bewildered Germans surrendered to him, asking pitifully, “Have the Japanese finally turned against us too? Like the Italians?” To such questions Goro replied without emotion: “We’re Americans. Move through and back.” But if he kept his hard face a mask of indifference, secretly he trembled with joy whenever he accepted the surrender of units from Hitler’s master race. It was understandable, therefore, that Goro Sakagawa, like his superiors, interpreted the Vosges campaign as the beginning of the end for Hitler. But this was a sad miscalculation, for if the young, untrained Nazi troops sometime faltered, their clever Prussian generals did not. They were now charged with defending the German homeland, and from his epic success at Monte Cassino, Colonel Sep Seigl, now General Seigl, had arrived at the Vosges to organize resistance at that natural bastion. Therefore, if he allowed his rag-tag troops to surrender in panic to the Triple Two’s, it was for a reason; and in late October of 1944 this reason became apparent, for on the twenty-fourth of that month General Seigl’s troops appeared to collapse in a general rout, retreating helter-skelter through the difficult Vosges terrain; and in so doing they enticed the battle-hungry Texans to rush after them, moving far ahead of American tanks and into the neatest trap of the war.</p>

  <p class="normal">General Seigl announced the springing of his trap with a gigantic barrage of fire that sealed the bewildered Texans into a pocket of mountains. “We will shoot them off one by one,” Seigl ordered, moving his troops forward. “We’ll show the Americans what it means to invade German soil.” And he swung his prearranged guns into position and began pumping high explosives at the Texan camp. There without food or water or adequate ammunition, the gallant Texans dug in and watched the rim of fire creep constantly closer.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point an American journalist coined the phrase the “Lost Battalion,” and in Texas radios were kept tuned around the clock. Whole villages listened to agonizing details as the sons of that proud state prepared to die as bravely as their circumstances would permit. A sob echoed across the prairies, and Texans began to shout, “Get our boys out of there! For Christsake, do something!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Thus what had been intended as respite for the Triple Two suddenly became the dramatic high point of the war. A personal messenger from the Senate warned the Pentagon: “Get those Texans out of there or else.” The Pentagon radioed SHAEF: “Effect rescue immediately. Top priority white.” <span>SHAEF</span> advised headquarters in Paris, and they wirelessed General McLarney, at the edge of the Vosges. It was he who told Colonel Mark Whipple, “You will penetrate the German ring of firepower and rescue those men. from Texas.” Lest there be any misunderstanding, another general flew in from Paris, red-faced and bitter, and he said, “We’re going to be crucified if we let those boys die. Get them, goddamn it, get them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Colonel Whipple summoned Lieutenant Goro Sakagawa and said, “You’ve got to go up that ridge, Goro. You mustn’t come back without them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll bring ‘em out,” Goro replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he was about to depart, Mark Whipple took his hand and shook it with that quiet passion that soldiers know on the eve of battle. “This is the end of our road, Goro. The President himself has ordered this one. Win this time, and you win your war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a murderous, hellish mission. A heavy fog enveloped the freezing Vosges Mountains, and no man could look ahead more than fifteen feet. As Baker Company filed into the pre-dawn gloom, each Japanese had to hold onto the field pack of the boy in front, for only in this manner could the unit be kept together. From the big, moss-covered trees of the forest, German snipers cut down one Hawaiian boy after another, until occasionally some Japanese in despairing frustration would stand stubbornly with his feet apart, firing madly into the meaningless fog. At other times German machine guns stuttered murderously from a distance of twenty feet. But Goro became aware of one thing: firepower that an hour before had been pouring in upon the doomed Texans was now diverted.</p>

  <p class="normal">To rescue the Lost Battalion, the Two-Two-Two had to march only one mile, but it was the worst mile in the world, and to negotiate it was going to require four brutal days without adequate water or food or support. The casualties suffered by the Japanese were staggering, and Goro sensed that if he brought his two younger brothers through this assault, it would be a miracle. He therefore cautioned them: “Kids, keep close to the trees. When we move from one to the other, run like hell across the open space. And when you hit your tree, whirl about instantly to shoot any Germans that might have infiltrated behind you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the end of the first day the Triple Two’s had gained only nine hundred feet, and within the circle of steel wounded Texans were beginning to die from gangrene. Next morning the Japanese boys pushed on, a yard at a time, lost in cold fog, great mossy trees and pinnacles of rock. Almost every foot of the way provided General Seigl’s riflemen with ideal cover, and they used it to advantage. With methodical care, they fired only when some Japanese ran directly into their guns, and they killed the Triple Two’s with deadly accuracy. On that cold, rainy second day the Japanese troops gained six hundred feet, and nearly a hundred of the trapped Texans died from wounds and fresh barrages.</p>

  <p class="normal">A curious factor of the battle was that all the world could watch. It was known that the Texans were trapped; it was known that the Two-Two-Two’s were headed toward their rescue, and the deadly game fascinated the press. A Minnesota corporal who had fought with the Triple Two’s in Italy told a newspaperman, “If anybody can get ‘em, the slant-eyes will.” In Honolulu newspapers that phrase was killed, but the entire community, sensing the awful odds against which their sons were fighting, prayed.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the third day of this insane attempt to force the ring of fire, Baker Company was astonished to see trudging up the hill they had just traversed the familiar figure of Colonel Mark Whipple. The men well knew the basic rule of war: “Lieutenants leads platoons against the enemy. Captains stay back and encourage the entire company. Majors and light colonels move between headquarters and the companies. But chicken colonels stay put.” Yet here was Colonel Whipple, a West Point chicken colonel, breaking the rule and moving into the front lines. Instinctively the Japanese boys saluted as he passed. When he reached Goro he said simply, “We’re going to march up that ridge and rescue the Texans today.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was a suicidal approach and no one knew it better than Whipple, but it had been commanded by headquarters. “I can’t order my boys into another Cassino,” he had protested. “This is worse than Cassino,” headquarters had admitted, “but it’s got to be done.” Whipple had saluted and said, “Then I must lead the boys myself.” And there he was.</p>

  <p class="normal">His inspiration gave the Japanese the final burst of courage they needed. With terrifying intensity of spirit the Two-Two-Two moved up the ridge. The fighting was murderous, with Germans firing point-blank at the rescuers. Barrages from hidden guns, planted weeks before at specific spots by General Seigl, cut down the Triple Two’s with fearful effect, and at one faltering point Goro thought: “Why should we have to penetrate such firepower? We’re losing more than we’re trying to save.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As if he sensed that some such question might be tormenting his troops and halting their flow of courage, Colonel Whipple moved among them, calling, “Sometimes you do things for a gesture. This is the ultimate gesture. They’re waiting for us, over that ridge.” But the men of the Triple Two could not banish the ugly thought that haunted them: “Texans are important and have to be saved. Japanese are expendable.” But no one spoke these words, for all knew that the Texas fighters didn’t have to prove anything; the Japanese did.</p>

  <p class="normal">When might fell on the twenty-ninth of October the Japanese troops were still four hundred yards short of their goal. They slept standing up, or leaning against frozen trees. There was no water, no food, no warmth. Outpost sentries, when relieved, muttered, “I might as well stay here with you.” There was no bed. Men ached and those with minor wounds felt the blood throbbing in their veins. Hundreds were already dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn a German sniper, hidden with Teutonic thoroughness, fired into the grim encampment and killed Private Minoru Sakagawa. For some minutes his brother Goro was not aware of what had happened, but then young Shigeo cried, “Jesus! They killed Minoru!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro, hearing his brother’s agonized cry, ran up and saw Minoru dead upon the frozen ground. This was too much to bear, and he began to lose his reason. “Achhhh!” he cried with a great rasping noise in his throat. Two of his brothers had now died while under his command, and the rest of his troops seemed doomed. His right hand began trembling while his voice continued to cry a meaningless “Achhhh.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Colonel Whipple, who knew what was happening, rushed up and clouted the young lieutenant brutally across the face. “Not now, Goro!” he commanded, using a strange phrase: Not now, as if later it would be permissible to go out of one’s mind, as if at some later time all men might do so, including Whipple himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro fell back and his hand stopped trembling. Staring in dull panic at his colonel, he tried vainly to focus on the problems at hand, but failed. He could see only his brother, fallen on the pine needles of the Vosges. Then his cold reason returned, and he drew his revolver. Grabbing Shigeo by the shoulder he said, “You walk here.” Then to his men he roared, in Japanese, “We won’t stop!” And with appalling force he and his team marched in among the great trees.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a desperate, horrible hand-to-hand fight up the last thousand feet of the ridge. Shigeo, following the almost paralyzed fury of his brother, exhibited a courage he did not know he had. He moved directly onto German positions and grenaded them to shreds. He ducked behind trees like a veteran, and when the last roadblock stood ahead, ominous and spewing death, it was mild-mannered Shigeo, the quiet one of the Sakagawa boys—though there were now only two left—who with, demonic craftiness went against it, drew its fire so that he could spot its composition, and then leaped inside with grenades and a Tommy gun. He killed eleven Germans, and when his companions moved past him to the ultimate rescue of the Texans he leaned out of the Nazi position and cheered like a schoolboy.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re a lieutenant!” Colonel Whipple snapped as he went forward to join the Texans, and a boy from Maui looked at Shig and said in pidgin, “Jeez, krauts all pau!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In rough formation, with Lieutenant Goro Sakagawa at their head, the Japanese boys marched in to greet the Texans, and a tall Major Burns from Houston stumbled forward, his ankle in bad shape, and tried to salute, but the emotion of the moment was too great. He was famished and burning with thirst, and before he got to Goro he fell in the dust. Then he rose to his knees and said from that position, “Thank God. You fellows from the Jap outfit?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Japanese,” Goro replied evenly. He stooped to help the Texan to his feet and saw that the man was at least a foot taller than he was. All the Texans, starving and parched though they were, were enormous men, and it seemed indecent that a bunch of runty little rice-eaters should have rescued them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Against his will, for Major Burns was a very brave man and had kept his troops alive mainly through the force of his extraordinary character, the tall Texan began to weep. Then he was ashamed of himself, bit his lip till it nearly bled and asked, “Could my men have some water?” He turned to his troops and shouted, “Give these Japs a big welcome.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Goro grabbed the major as if they were two toughs back in Kakaako and said in sudden, surging anger, “Don’t you call us Japs!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Goro!” Colonel Whipple shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What, sir?” He didn’t remember what he had just said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“All right,” Whipple snapped. “Let’s start down the hill.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Japanese troops formed two lines at the entrance to the pocket in which the Texans had been trapped, and as the giant men passed to freedom between the pairs of stubby Triple Two’s some of the Texans began to laugh, and soon the pocket was choked with merriment, in which big Texans began to embrace their rescuers and kiss them and jump them up into the air. “You little guys got guts,” a huge fellow from Abilene shouted. “I thought we was done for.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Lieutenant Sakagawa did not join the celebration. He was watching his men, and estimated dully that of the original 1,200 Japanese boys that had set out to storm the ridge, fully two-thirds were now either dead or severely wounded. This terrible toll, including his brother Minoru, was almost more than he could tolerate, and he began mumbling, “Why did we have to lose so many little guys to save so few big ones?” It had cost 800 Japanese to rescue 341 Texans. Then his mind began to harden and to come back under control, and to discipline it he began checking off Baker Company, and he found that of the 183 men who had waded ashore with him at Salerno in September of 1943 only seven had managed to stick with the outfit through October of 1944. The rest—all 176 of them—were either dead or wounded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Shigeo rushed up to advise his brother that Colonel Whipple had promoted him on the field of battle, a soldier’s sweetest triumph, and the brilliant-eyed youth shouted, “Goro, I guess this time we really showed the world!” But Goro, counting the dead, wondered: “How much more do we have to prove?” And from the manner in which his mind jerked from one image to the next, he realized that he was close to mental collapse, but he was saved by a curious experience. From among the Texans a hysterical medic, his mind deranged by three shells that had exploded while he was trying to cut off a shattered leg, began moving from one Japanese to another, mumbling. “Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Major Burns heard the speech and yelled, “There goes that goddamned odd-ball again. Please, please, shut him up!”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the medic had reached Goro, to whom he mumbled, “Lieutenant, indeed it is true. No man hath greater love than this, that he would march up such a fucking ridge to save a complete crock of shit like Major Burns.” In his wildness the medic turned to face Burns, screaming hysterically, “I hate you! I hate you! You led us into this death trap, you crazy, crazy beast!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Almost sadly, Major Burns, pivoting on his good leg, swung on the medic and knocked him out. “He was more trouble than the Germans,” he apologized. “Somebody haul the poor bastard out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Before any of the Texans could get to the capsized medic, Goro had compassionately pulled the unconscious fellow into his arms. A gigantic Texan came along to help, and the odd trio started down the bloody ridge, but when they had returned halfway to safety, General Seigl’s last furious barrage enveloped them, and two shells bracketed Colonel Mark Whipple, killing him instantly. Goro, who witnessed the death, dropped his hold on the medic and started toward the man who had done so much for the Japanese, but at long last his nervous system gave way.</p>

  <p class="normal">The awful “Achhhh” filled his throat, and his hands began trembling. His head jerked furiously as if he were an epileptic and his eyes went vacant like those of an imbecile. “Achhhh! Aohhhh!” he began to shout hysterically, and he started falling to his right, but caught himself by clutching air. His voice cleared and he began screaming, “Don’t you call me a Jap! Goddamn you big blond Texans, don’t you call me a yellow-belly!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In wild fury he began lashing out at his tormentors, stupidly, ineffectively. He kept shouting irrelevant threats at the Texans whom he had just saved, and was ready to fight even the biggest. One man from Dallas gently held him off as an adult would a child, and it was pathetic to see the stocky Japanese swinging wildly at the air, unable to reach his giant adversary. Finally he returned to the horrible achhhh sound, and at this point his brother Shigeo ran up to take command. He pinioned Goro’s arms, and when the latter seemed about to break out once more, Shigeo smashed a hard right-cut to the jaw and slowed him down.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Goro began to whimper like a child, and two men from his outfit had the decency to cover him with a blanket, so that his disintegration would not be visible to his own troops, and in this condition they patiently led him, shivering and shuddering, out of the Vosges Mountains where the Texans had been trapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward the foothills they passed through a guard unit from their own battalion, and a young lieutenant from Able Company, a haole boy from Princeton asked, “Who you got under the blanket?” and Shigeo replied, “Lieutenant Sakagawa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Was he the one who got through to the Texans?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who else?” Shig replied, and as the cortege of wounded and near-mad and starved and war-torn passed, the Princeton man looked at Goro Sakagawa’s mechanically shuffling feet and muttered, “There goes an American.”</p>
