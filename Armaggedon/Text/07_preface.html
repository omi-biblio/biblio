      <h1 class="CT"><b>“Welcome to Armageddon”</b></h1>

      <p class="CO">Each day throughout the year, the tour buses begin arriving at Megiddo soon after 9:00 a.m., disgorging fifty tourists at a time. By the time the site closes at 5:00 p.m., several dozen buses will have deposited hundreds of visitors. “Welcome to Armageddon,” the tour guides say, as they march their flocks up the steep incline and through the ancient city gate. Reciting their practiced patter as they go, they reach the first stopping point. The group members catch their breath and, frequently, burst into hymns or prayers, especially if they are on their way to Nazareth, located almost directly across the valley.</p>

      <p class="TX">Our small group of archaeologists smile tolerantly, having been at the site since before dawn. Wielding pickaxes, trowels, and dustpans, filling buckets and wheelbarrows full of freshly excavated dirt, we play our game of guessing the nationality of each group from fifty yards away, as they come around the last corner of the incline before heading past our excavation area. From the nearby Northern Observation Platform, they gaze up the length of the Jezreel Valley on one side and down into the depths of the Chicago excavation trench on the other. Attached to the chain-link fence, which only rarely deters tourists from coming into the excavation area, is our sign that jokingly reads, “Please do not feed the archaeologists.” We may not get their nationalities right, but that doesn’t stop us from hoping that they might have some extra cookies.</p>

      <p class="SB1">Megiddo is mentioned a dozen times in the Hebrew Bible, and in a multitude of other ancient texts, but it is especially well-known as the setting in the New Testament for the penultimate battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil. We are told in Revelation 16:16 that the two opposing armies will assemble “at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-1" id="fm6_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="xiv" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xiv" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xiv"></span>In fact, the very word <i>Armageddon</i> comes from <i>Har Megiddo</i>—Hebrew for the “mound” or “mountain” (<i>har</i>) of Megiddo. By the Middle Ages, multiple nationalities, languages, and centuries had added an <i>n</i> and dropped the <i>h</i>, transforming <i>Har Megiddo</i> to <i>Harmageddon</i> and thence to <i>Armageddon</i>.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-2" id="fm6_2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">There have actually been numerous Armageddons at the ancient site of Megiddo already, as one civilization, group, or political entity gave way to another over the millennia—one world ending and another beginning—from the Canaanites to the Israelites, and then the Neo-Assyrians, Neo-Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, followed in turn by the Muslims, crusaders, Mongols, Mamlukes, Ottomans, and, most recently, World War I and the 1948 Israeli War of Independence.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-3" id="fm6_3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> However, it is the New Testament’s Armageddon that is the most famous and which is responsible for attracting the tourists.</p>

      <p class="TX">The ancient mound once stood more than one hundred feet (thirty-six meters) above the surrounding fields, at its highest point in the north. A visitor to the site in 1904 was surprised at just how high it was. Instead of the low mound that he expected to see, he found instead “a proper hill that dominates the plain.” The Chicago archaeologists reduced its height by removing the topmost occupation layers, but even so it still towers over the <span aria-label="xv" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xv" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xv"></span>Jezreel Valley today, easily more than seventy feet high and readily visible from a great distance.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-4" id="fm6_4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Early photographs show the mound in its pristine state, as yet untouched by the excavators’ shovels and picks and without all of the huge spoil heaps of excavated earth that now litter the area. Taken from the north, they show the mound rising majestically in the distance. From this side, two distinct levels can be discerned: a lower level with a perfectly horizontal terrace about halfway up the mound, upon which Gottlieb Schumacher, the first excavator, said he found the remains of a fortification wall protecting the city; and a slightly smaller upper level that sits directly on top of this lower level, like a second story on a house or the upper layer of a cake.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-5" id="fm6_5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Within the mound itself, we now know, are the remains of at least twenty ancient cities, built one on top of another over the course of nearly five thousand years, from about 5000 BCE to just before 300 BCE. The various excavators have given a Roman numeral to each one, I–XX, numbering them sequentially. Stratum I, at the very top, is the most recent, dating to the Persian period. Stratum XX, located just above the native bedrock, is the oldest settlement, dating to the Neolithic period. The strata in between date to the Copper, Bronze, and Iron Ages, including the time of the Canaanites and the Israelites (see <a href="#table001">table 1</a>).</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">It isn’t easy for us to get to the site by 5:00 a.m. every day. We need to, though, in order to get in an eight-hour workday before it gets too hot. The alarm clocks are set to go off very early at the kibbutz where we are staying; by the ungodly hour of 4:35 a.m., we are packed into several large buses and a small fleet of cars—though a fleet of small cars is perhaps a more apt description. There are nearly 120 of us, counting both the professional archaeologists and graduate students who make up the staff plus the volunteer team members who have come from all walks of life—doctors, lawyers, nurses, accountants, schoolteachers, students, and others—for a “once in a lifetime” experience.</p>

      <p class="TX">The staff members, all of whom have been working with us at Megiddo for several seasons, are in the cars for the most part, though some are with the volunteers in the buses, reclining in air-conditioned comfort even at this early hour and desperately trying to grab a few last minutes of sleep. I am usually behind the wheel of a Mazda 3, or a <i>shalosh</i>, as we affectionately call it, a type of car that most Israelis also seem to drive, though I don’t use the <span aria-label="xvi" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xvi" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xvi"></span>horn nearly as much as the rest of them do. It was originally dark blue when I first picked it up in Tel Aviv, but now it is a solid brown, thanks to the layer of dirt that coats every inch of the outside. I mentally remind myself to take it through a car wash before returning it to the rental company at the end of the dig season, but I’ll probably forget to do so and have to throw myself on their mercy, as has happened several times in the past. Israel Finkelstein, codirector of the dig and probably the best-known archaeologist working in Israel today, is in the passenger seat, as he is most days. I concentrate on driving safely as we speed through the darkness.</p>

      <p class="TX">We reach Megiddo some twenty-five minutes later and leave our cars in the parking lot next to the Visitor Welcome Center, which was converted <span aria-label="xvii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xvii" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xvii"></span>from what remained of the original Chicago dig house, first built during the mid-1920s. It now features a restaurant, bathrooms, a few gift shops, and two rooms presenting a brief history of the excavations, complete with a model of the ancient site that has moving parts if you push the right buttons.</p>

      <p class="TX">We begin walking up the ancient mound, lugging our digging tools, water jugs, and other supplies, clutched in both hands or carried on our backs. Our sleep-deprived brains barely register the fact that beneath our feet are layers of remains stretching back through human history.</p>

      <p class="TX">Passing through the Late Bronze Age city gate, which dates back to before the time of the heretic Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten in the fourteenth century BCE, we proceed along the tourist path and eventually reach the top of the mound. Dotted with palm trees, the surface is covered by a tangle of ancient ruins as far as the eye can see. Here the team members split into groups, each heading to their different excavation areas.</p>

      <p class="TX">After quickly raising the poles that support the black shades covering each area to protect us from the sun, we have a few minutes to relax. Sipping cups of coffee and munching on breakfast bars, we watch the sun rise from behind Mount Tabor and burn the early morning mist off the floor of the Jezreel Valley. The dawn temperature is already seventy degrees Fahrenheit. The mosquitoes are biting, for the light wind is not enough to disperse them, but it is a temporary annoyance. They will soon disappear as the temperature rockets into the nineties and beyond over the course of the next few hours. By the time we leave in the early afternoon, the site feels like an oven. It’s not hard to imagine that we are indeed working at Armageddon, even though it is only June. And we are lucky. The real heat will come in August. Nobody, not even archaeologists, is crazy enough to dig then.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Megiddo was my home away from home every other summer for twenty years, from 1994 to 2014. I dug at the site as a member of the Tel Aviv Expedition for almost as long as I have been married to my wife, Diane Harris Cline. She was the one who spotted the original flier advertising for volunteers and staff to take part in a new series of excavations at the site.</p>

      <p class="TX">I was interested in participating for several reasons, including the fact that Megiddo has been at the center of biblical archaeology for more than a century, but also because of James Michener’s book <i>The Source</i>, which I have read six times and which was influential in my choice of career. His book <span aria-label="xviii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xviii" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xviii"></span>was published to worldwide acclaim in 1965 and ranked number 1 on the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list for almost a year. In it, Michener dramatically portrays the history of an archaeological site in Israel as well as the story of the archaeologists who were uncovering it. Although his site of “Makor” (Hebrew for “source,” as in “a source of water”) is fictitious, Michener visited Megiddo, among numerous other sites, during the year that he spent researching and writing the book while living at the Dan Carmel Hotel in Haifa in 1963. The parallels are obvious to those familiar with both Makor and Megiddo.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-6" id="fm6_6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

        <figcaption><p class="figh">F<span class="ePub-SC">IG. 2.</span> James Henry Breasted (courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Archives)</p></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="TX">Michener also quite clearly based his fictitious archaeologists upon real ones, including specifying that John Cullinane, the director of the dig at Makor, came from “the Biblical Museum in Chicago.” This can only be a tip of the hat to James Henry Breasted, the preeminent Egyptologist and distinguished founder and director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, who favored three-piece suits, rimless glasses, and a debonair mustache. It was he who sent the team of actual archaeologists to Megiddo during the years from 1925 onward.</p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="xix" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xix" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xix"></span>By the time I retired from active participation at the site, only Israel Finkelstein, the patriarchal Israeli archaeologist who has been codirector of the project since it began in 1992, and David Ussishkin, his longtime colleague, had worked there longer. Over the course of ten seasons in twenty years, I dug in most of the areas that we opened up, as I rose through the ranks from a volunteer to eventually join Finkelstein as codirector of the expedition.</p>

      <p class="TX">Our daughter, Hannah, first came with us when she was eighteen months old, digging in the dirt with a trowel that seemed immense in her tiny hands, wearing a shirt cut down to size that read, “I Survived Armageddon.” Our son, Joshua, was born five years after I joined the excavation team, and he was with me at Megiddo as I began to write the opening chapters of this book—by the time he turned eighteen, he had celebrated almost as many birthdays on excavations in Israel as he had at home in the United States.</p>

      <p class="TX">I met many interesting people and made longtime friends during my summers at Megiddo. Above all, each excavation season, I was able to introduce anywhere from four to forty students from my university to the trials and tribulations of digging, along with countless other volunteers from elsewhere who were fulfilling a lifelong dream to participate in an excavation.</p>

      <p class="TX">We were the fourth group of excavators to have dug at Megiddo over the course of the past century. The first was Gottlieb Schumacher, an American of German ancestry whose excavations from 1903 to 1905 were sponsored by the German Oriental Society and the German Society for the Exploration of Palestine. Twenty years later, in 1925, the Chicago excavators who are the focus of this book arrived at the site, determined to find Solomon’s city. They stayed for fourteen excavation seasons, halting only because of World War II.</p>

      <p class="TX">The famous Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin was responsible for the third expedition to investigate the ancient mound. He came with his graduate students for a few seasons in the 1960s and 1970s to test various hypotheses, including whether he could identify Solomon’s building activities at the site.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-7" id="fm6_7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">And then our Tel Aviv Expedition, under the continuous codirection of Israel Finkelstein and David Ussishkin, began with a trial season in 1992 and started in earnest in 1994.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-8" id="fm6_8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Like the other archaeologists who had dug at Megiddo before us, we were hoping to uncover more secrets of its past, including more precisely dating the various levels and more accurately <span aria-label="xx" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xx" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xx"></span>determining the historical sequence within the mound. We were also interested in answering specialized queries about what the inhabitants ate, wore, feared, and believed in each time period. The answers often remain debated and frustratingly elusive, although the advent of new scientific techniques is now shedding additional light and providing fresh data for Megiddo, frequently at a micro-archaeological level.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-9" id="fm6_9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> A final set of questions pertained to Finkelstein’s controversial suggestion that much of what archaeologists thought were tenth-century BCE remains from the time of Solomon at various sites, including Megiddo, should in fact be redated to the ninth century BCE and the time of Omri and Ahab. This is known as the “Low Chronology” hypothesis and is still the focus of much discussion among archaeologists.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-10" id="fm6_10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Since Megiddo has been excavated on and off for more than a century at this point, virtually every building uncovered at the site has been the subject of multiple articles and scholarly debates as to its form, function, and especially date. This includes everything from the city gate in each level, to the water tunnel, the stables, the palaces, and even the private houses.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-11" id="fm6_11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">As usual in archaeology, much of what the earlier excavators said about their discoveries at Megiddo now needs to be reconsidered in light of more recent discussions. Even the final publications of the Chicago team, especially the volumes usually called <i>Megiddo I</i> and <i>Megiddo II</i>, were the subject of debates virtually as soon as they were published in 1939 and 1948, respectively. Therefore, we placed some of our trenches in areas that we hoped would clarify the issues and provide some more definitive answers.</p>

      <p class="TX">It is also frequently the case that archaeologists working at an ancient site like Megiddo, while trying to answer one question, will unexpectedly confront several more. However, that is in part why archaeology is so intriguing, and it simply motivates us to eagerly head back out into the field each season. It was the same in the 1920s and 1930s, for the Chicago archaeologists who spent a decade and a half trying to unlock its secrets.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">It was the Chicago archaeologists who were responsible for having dug all the way down to bedrock. They were led by a succession of field directors: first Clarence Fisher, then P.L.O. Guy, and finally Gordon Loud, all sent to Megiddo by Breasted.</p>

      <p class="TX">Breasted made it clear that he was particularly interested in discovering the remains of two cities out of the many that lay within the ancient mound. <span aria-label="xxi" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxi" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xxi"></span>One was Solomon’s, which that ancient king had reportedly fortified during the tenth century BCE, according to the Hebrew Bible. The other had been captured by the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III nearly five hundred years earlier, in 1479 BCE, according to his own records.</p>

      <p class="TX">However, the search for Solomon and for Thutmose III was not as straightforward as the Chicago archaeologists expected. The excavations rarely provided answers to their questions, and what they uncovered at the site was often unexpected. There were some years when they found next to nothing except tangled architecture and pottery sherds by the thousands, which were of interest only to themselves and other archaeologists. And there were other times when their discoveries made the front page of newspapers around the world, especially when they announced that they had found “Solomon’s Stables” at the site.</p>

      <p class="TX">Despite consisting largely of architects and geologists retrained as archaeologists and pottery specialists, and notwithstanding changes in personnel on an almost yearly basis, this team was among the best to excavate in the Middle East at the time. They retrieved the entire chronological history of Megiddo, from the Neolithic period to the Persian era, and noted the later Roman graves and adjacent remains as well. Along the way, they incorporated cutting-edge innovations and techniques, including balloon photography, vertical excavation, and the use of the Munsell color system for describing soil color. Their discoveries and innovations still resonate throughout biblical archaeology.</p>

      <p class="TX">The scholarly publications by the Chicago excavators present their final thoughts on the results of their excavations. Their discoveries are justifiably famous, including stables, ivories, and an impressive water tunnel. The books and articles that they published are still used, and debated, by archaeologists working in the region today. However, these provide only a small window into the daily activities of the team members and the stories behind their discoveries.</p>

      <p class="TX">Fortunately, they also left behind a treasure trove of other writings—more than three decades’ worth of letters, cablegrams, cards, and notes exchanged by the participants, as well as the diaries that they kept. In working through these archival materials, currently housed at the Oriental Institute, the Rockefeller Archive Center, the Israel Antiquities Authority, and elsewhere, I realized that they provide us with a glimpse behind the scenes, a peek at the internal workings of the dig, playing out against the backdrop of the Great Depression in the United States as well as the growing troubles and <span aria-label="xxii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxii" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xxii"></span>tensions in British Mandate Palestine between the two world wars. We also get a glimpse of what the early years of biblical archaeology were like, including the backstory of <i>how</i> they actually did the archaeology, and the tools and techniques that they used at the time; in some ways, it is a far cry from what we do and use today, while in other ways it has not changed at all.</p>

      <p class="TX">As a result, my research for this book took an unexpected and interesting turn. I had originally envisioned writing just about the archaeology of Megiddo, describing it layer by layer, building by building, from the beginning of its occupation to the end, without paying much attention to the archaeologists who had actually revealed the ancient remains. However, the wealth of detail contained in the letters, diaries, cables, and notes of the Chicago personnel revealed so much about their interactions, as well as the specific details of what went on during each of the excavation seasons, that I decided that they—and their efforts—should be the primary focus of the story (or should at least get equal billing).<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm6-12" id="fm6_12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">I should also note that I came to more fully appreciate the work of archivists—in particular their friendliness and patience, even with a naive researcher asking endless questions that usually had obvious answers. Furthermore, to my surprise, and delight, I found the archival research to be unexpectedly similar to doing an archaeological excavation, except that it involved digging through paper rather than dirt. Just as with a dig at an ancient site, where the presence (or absence) of a single item can sometimes make a tremendous difference, trying to resolve a specific issue at an archive often raised a whole host of other questions even while answering the original query. There was also the same thrill of finding something, especially the unexpected; the same dejection at coming up dry despite a promising beginning; and the same satisfaction that comes from putting together enough puzzle pieces to yield a plausible hypothesis for a past event.</p>

      <p class="TX">Moreover, subsequent communications with descendants of the Chicago team members, as well as very basic genealogical research on Ancestry.com, resulted in the acquisition of additional material and information, ranging from letters and diaries to war records and details about their careers after Megiddo, which shed more light on individual team members such as Edward DeLoach, Daniel Higgins, Laurence Woolman, and even Gordon Loud and both Clarence and Stanley Fisher. I hope that I have been able to bring all of them to life in the pages of this book, for the material allowed me to better understand and discuss these team members as real people in the context of their times, with hopes, fears, dreams, problems, ambitions, <span aria-label="xxiii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxiii" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xxiii"></span>and desires, rather than simply as names on the spines of books or in bland lists of participants, which is what they had been to me previously.</p>

      <p class="TX">As a whole, their story includes intrigues, infighting, romance, and dogged perseverance, as well as the details underlying the drastic changes in staff and directors, before the digging came to an abrupt and unexpected end because of World War II. It frequently reads more like the script for a daytime soap opera, for the improbable cast of characters included an architect who became one of the best excavators of his day, but who couldn’t manage a team of diggers, and a British Zionist who was married to the daughter of the man who reinvented Hebrew as a modern language, but who himself had neither a college degree nor any formal training in archaeology, and was fired for writing “one of the most scurrilous letters ever received” by the Oriental Institute. There was also a surveyor who sued for wrongful termination, but who may also have been spying for the Haganah while at the site; a young scholar arrested for smuggling antiquities on his way home, but who went on to a successful academic career nevertheless; and a high school dropout without a degree in archaeology and a geology student initially without an undergraduate degree, who together published more of the final excavation reports than anyone else—all micromanaged by Breasted from far-off Chicago and funded by one of the wealthiest men of the day, John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</p>

      <p class="TX">That story, of their quest to uncover biblical Armageddon and to lay bare the city of Solomon, and of their intertwined personal and professional interactions during the search, can now be untangled and told. However, a brief word of explanation is necessary before we start. Beginning with the third chapter, the chapters in <a href="09_pt1.html">parts I</a> and <a href="14_pt2.html">II</a> have been written as a series of pairs. In each case, the first chapter in each pair (e.g., <a href="12_ch3.html">chapter 3</a>) deals with the Megiddo personnel and their issues during a particular period, while the other chapter (e.g., <a href="13_ch4.html">chapter 4</a>) discusses the actual archaeology that they conducted during the same period.</p>

      <p class="TX">This was done in order to separate the personal from the professional during the seasons directed by Fisher and by Guy (it is not necessary for the seasons directed by Loud). However, the format is also meant specifically as an homage to the memory of James Michener, in gratitude and admiration, for his book was also written as a series of alternating chapters. I hope that readers will find my factual account of Megiddo and its Chicago excavators even half as interesting and entertaining as I found Michener’s fictional story about Makor and its archaeologists.</p>
