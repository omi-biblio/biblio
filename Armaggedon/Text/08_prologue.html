      <h1 class="CT"><b>“Have Found Solomon’s Stables”</b></h1>

      <p class="CO">Everything changed in early June 1928, when James Henry Breasted, director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, received a Western Union cablegram. Sent by P.L.O. Guy, field director of the team of excavators that Breasted had sent to dig at Megiddo, the cable read: “<small>FIRST KINGS NINE FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN AND TEN TWENTYSIX STOP STRATUM FOUR APPARENTLY CORRESPONDS STOP BELIEVE HAVE FOUND SOLOMON’S STABLES</small>.”</p>

      <p class="TX">Considering that he had been waiting nearly three years for such a discovery, Breasted demonstrated remarkable restraint. He calmly cabled back a single word that same day: “<small>CONGRATULATIONS</small>.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm7-1" id="fm7_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The rest of the world wasn’t nearly as calm, cool, or collected. It’s not every day that an archaeological team cites chapter and verse from the Hebrew Bible to describe their new finds, especially when those discoveries are tentatively identified as King Solomon’s stables. In fact, Breasted was far more excited than he had let on. “I have now received full confirmation of the discovery of the stables of Solomon in our excavations at Armageddon,” he told John D. Rockefeller, Jr., alerting him to the news before the official announcement was made public.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm7-2" id="fm7_2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The <i>New York Times</i> breathlessly reported on the discovery in early August, after receiving detailed information from Breasted. A longer article ran later that month, entitled “Digging Up the ‘Glory’ of King Solomon.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm7-3" id="fm7_3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> What more could a newspaper—or an excavation sponsored by Rockefeller—want? Armageddon and King Solomon in the same story was a scoop of the highest magnitude. It also made Breasted, and their financial backers in New York, especially happy, for it seemed that they had finally found the first remains from the city of Solomon for which they had been searching.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm7-4" id="fm7_4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The story also ran on page 1 of the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>, with the headline “Excavators Find Stables of Solomon at Armageddon.” In it, Breasted was quoted as saying: “Such a discovery will be of the greatest historical <span aria-label="2" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_2" role="doc-pagebreak" title="2"></span>importance. Few people are aware that Solomon was not only an Oriental sovereign, but likewise a successful merchant. Not the least of his activities was his enterprise as a horse dealer.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm7-5" id="fm7_5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Breasted may have been thinking of horse-trading, but the two verses that Guy cited in his cable are the ones more usually quoted in tandem still today, in order to describe Megiddo as one of Solomon’s “chariot cities”:</p>

      <p class="bqf">And this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the <small>LORD</small> and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer. (1 Kings 9:15)</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="EX">And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. (1 Kings 10:26)<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm7-6" id="fm7_6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="TX">The discovery of these buildings launched Megiddo into the limelight of biblical archaeology, where it has remained ever since, even as suspicions emerged that Solomon may not have built them and that they might not even be stables.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#fm7-7" id="fm7_7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> This is the story of that site and of the Chicago archaeologists whom Breasted sent to search for Solomon’s city.</p>
