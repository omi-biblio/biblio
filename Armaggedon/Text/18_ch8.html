      <h1 class="CTT"><b>“The Tapping of the Pickmen”</b></h1>

      <p class="CO">Despite all the drama, there was actually some digging that took place from 1929 to 1931. In fact, it was in 1930 that they made their next major discovery, the famed water tunnel at Megiddo. Removing the earth that completely filled a wide shaft plunging straight down for 100 feet, and then doing the same in the connecting tunnel stretching out 150 feet more to the water source, consumed most of the team’s available time, energy, manpower, money, and ingenuity. It wasn’t until mid-June 1931 that Guy sent a long cable to Breasted, although he was so excited at that point that he neglected to translate it into code. It read in part:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="EX"><small>THE MOST REMARKABLE ANCIENT WATER SYSTEM WITH ACCESS FROM SUMMIT OF TELL THROUGH ALL STRATA TO ROCK WHERE ARE SHAFT STAIRCASE AND TUNNEL THE LAST NOT YET FULLY EXCAVATED. SWEET WATER AT DEPTH OF THIRTY-SEVEN METRES. LENGTH OF STAIRCASE BELOW SHAFT FOURTEEN METRES AND TUNNEL TODAY TWENTY-EIGHT METRES BY THREE METRES HIGH BY TWO BROAD</small>.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-1" id="chapter8_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">There was no indication that this lay in store for them when they began the 1929 excavations in mid-April, as soon as the Egyptian workmen arrived at Megiddo.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-2" id="chapter8_2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> They were able to clear a huge amount of topsoil—some thirty thousand square meters—before taking a break in July. Even though they did not go deeper than fifteen to twenty centimeters anywhere, that nevertheless generated nearly five thousand cubic meters of dirt, stones, and other debris that had to be conveyed to the dump. As a result, quite a bit of time was devoted to laying more track for the small railway, in order to bring the excavated detritus to the chutes, down through which it would tumble to the designated area below. As Guy noted, the dump was looking neat and <span aria-label="126" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_126" role="doc-pagebreak" title="126"></span>symmetrical at the moment and, he thought, would “form a good field for agriculture when the excavation is finished.” The top of the tell also was now completely gridded, with each of the squares marked by pegs solidly in place.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-3" id="chapter8_3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">All of that had taken about thirty-five days to do, which brought them up to 4 June, at which point they were actually able to dig for a month before knocking off for summer vacation. Guy noted that they were able to expose another stretch of City Wall 325, along with what he thought was a level of Sub-II remains, which included a large, well-constructed building that, as he put it, “had been chopped in two by Schumacher.”</p>

      <p class="TX">Perhaps most exciting, Guy said, was the discovery of the back wall of two stable units and an indication that there might be at least four more still buried under the later ruins. They had also, he said, “laid bare the great Tyrian gateway of King Solomon,” which reminded him of the gateway at Carchemish where he had dug long ago. Why he called it Solomonic and why he attributed it to “Tyrian” builders remained to be seen, but he was obviously thinking of the biblical verses concerning Hiram of Tyre and his craftsmen working on the temple in Jerusalem, just as he had cited the verses regarding Solomon’s chariot cities the previous season.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-4" id="chapter8_4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Even though the “Tyrian” gate was eventually reassigned by Lamon and Shipton to Stratum III and the Neo-Assyrian period, rather than to the Solomonic period in the tenth century BCE, this was an important discovery. It was the first time any of the excavators had located the main entrance to the city, in any period. During the following seasons, they would find ever-earlier versions of this city gate nearby, larger and more complex, dating right back through Stratum VIII and beyond. The configurations of these gates, and the precise periods to which each dated, along with further excavation by both Yadin and then the Tel Aviv excavators, would keep archaeologists busy and arguing for the next century, right up until today.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-5" id="chapter8_5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> They still play a significant role in the discussions of which level at Megiddo, if any, should actually be dated to the time of Solomon.</p>

      <p class="TX">Guy took some glee in describing the discovery of the gate to Breasted. As he put it:<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-6" id="chapter8_6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="bqf">As to the main gate, I have always felt that it ought to be in [Square] K9, and in K9 it is. The finding of it was amusing enough. Knowing what I was after, the small indications that I got when we had cleared comparatively little surface soil were sufficient to show me that the <span aria-label="127" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_127" role="doc-pagebreak" title="127"></span>plan was going to be like that of the South gate at Carchemish which I had helped Woolley to dig out ten years ago. I waited until I had got a few main points showing, moved the workmen to dig at places nearby for a short time, and set out the plan of the gate with strings and pegs. I then brought the men back and told them to dig for walls along the strings.</p>

      <p class="bql">I think that some of the locals suspect me of working some kind of magic … particularly with regard to the door-pivot sockets: I set a couple of men to look for these, saying that they ought to find stones with holes in them. One was visible after half a dozen strokes of the hoe, and the other a few minutes later—it was rather like bringing rabbits out of a hat!</p>

      <p class="TX">Guy then described in detail this two-chambered gate, complete with a sketch drawing on the fifth page of his letter. In further describing the excavation of an area next to it, he also hazarded a guess that the level he and Fisher had been calling Sub-II dated to the Neo-Assyrian phase. As he put it, “I have not yet enough material from Sub-II to enable me to determine its date, but I suspect it of being Assyrian.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-7" id="chapter8_7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> He was completely correct, although when Lamon and Shipton eventually published the results of the excavations, the name of the level was changed from “Sub-II” to “III,” as noted above, and so this gate is now assigned to that layer.</p>

      <p class="TX">Guy also reported that they had unearthed the foundations of a large number of buildings that were so near the modern surface of the tell that the uppermost stones had been scratched by plowshares. Most of these he dated to his Strata II and Sub-II, since Stratum I was absent for the most part. He was impressed in particular with the plaster floors that they came across and with the “quite up-to-date sanitary arrangements” in one of the buildings.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-8" id="chapter8_8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Moreover, he said that it should take no more than a month of work in the spring to finish excavating all of the upper layers across the entire mound, and that when these layers had been removed, the Solomonic city would be revealed “as a complete whole.” That would be the most that he could hope to do during the upcoming 1930 season, though, even working as fast as they were able, because he wasn’t at all sure how much longer it would take to get down to “Imperial Egyptian strata.” However, he was confident that they would be able to present their findings at the next Oriental Congress in 1931, and that they would “be rendering a very real service to near eastern archaeology, and one that will not be forgotten.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-9" id="chapter8_9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="128" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_128" role="doc-pagebreak" title="128"></span>In the meantime, Guy also had been engaged since January in arranging for a shipment of thirteen cases of antiquities to be sent to Chicago. This was their portion of the 1925–26 finds from Megiddo after the (supposedly annual) division had been made with the Department of Antiquities. Finally, after many delays, they were sent in mid-May. It was expected to take two months for them to arrive in New York; after their anticipated arrival in mid-July, they would be sent on to Chicago to form the nucleus of what is now an impressive collection of Megiddo artifacts at the Oriental Institute.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-10" id="chapter8_10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Aside from his putting Woolman and Lind to work making a reconstruction of the stables, one of the main innovations that Guy implemented during the season was balloon photography. In his letters back to Breasted, Guy enclosed some of the first aerial photographs that they had taken on top of the mound. In fact, these were among the first that had ever been taken in the entire region.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-11" id="chapter8_11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Guy later published an article about their experimental efforts in the journal <i>Antiquity</i>, in which he explained that he had first become interested in the idea of aerial photography way back in 1904. He then reconnected with it during World War I while using air photos “in connexion with the indirect firing of machine-guns,” and then again in 1922–23 while with the Palestine Department of Antiquities.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-12" id="chapter8_12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">They had already begun discussing the idea of using a balloon back in April 1929. At the time, Charles Breasted was not particularly keen on the idea. He sent Guy some correspondence and a brochure from the Sterling Rubber Company Limited of Canada, writing: “When you have perused this, you will be better able to judge the advisability of investing in an aeronautical department for Megiddo. My own reaction … is that by branching out into balloon ascensions, the Megiddo expedition runs a considerable risk of being blown into atoms. However, this again rests with you. Let us know your decision in the matter.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-13" id="chapter8_13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Having evidently decided that it was worth the risk, Guy subsequently asked Lamon, when the latter was headed for America, to procure an electrical release that could be controlled from the ground to trip the camera shutter. As it turned out, the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago was able to make it for them; Guy described it as “light and simple, and it works.” Lamon also brought back a small ready-made balloon that was generally used for meteorological purposes, which was lightweight and <span aria-label="129" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_129" role="doc-pagebreak" title="129"></span>cheap. In the meantime, Lind and DeLoach constructed a camera specifically for this purpose, which Guy describes as a fixed-focus camera made of three-ply wood that would hold one photographic lens and a 5<span class="symb">″ ×</span> 7<span class="symb">″</span> film holder. Several light steel wires were connected to the balloon, to hold it in place over the desired area as well as to conduct the electric current to the shutter release.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-14" id="chapter8_14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">They filled the balloon with hydrogen and sent it up. They were able to take two photographs on the first try, one of which was good and the other poor. However, as they were putting the balloon away in the garage, it burst with a “loudish pop.” And with that, as Guy described it, “the balloon, as such, ceased to exist.” He remarked that it was perhaps ironic that this had taken place on the fifth of November—Guy Fawkes Day, commemorating the infamous Gunpowder Plot of 1605 and still celebrated in England with fireworks, bonfires, and loud explosions.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-15" id="chapter8_15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="130" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_130" role="doc-pagebreak" title="130"></span>The importance of this pioneering and innovative work in archaeology cannot be underestimated. It led directly to our current use of drones for taking such aerial pictures today, as well as satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR now being used to record sites that are not easily visible at ground level.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-16" id="chapter8_16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="131" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_131" role="doc-pagebreak" title="131"></span>We also know about this entire episode from Janet Woolman’s diary as well as letters sent home by both Laurence and Janet Woolman, who were eyewitnesses. Janet confirmed that the balloon was attached to wires controlled from the ground and that a battery powered the camera—it was both complicated and expensive, she said. In her words: “It went off beautifully, took pictures, all well—but when they put the balloon into a shed for future use, bang, it burst for no good reason, wasting the hydrogen, the balloon in shreds.… But it could have been worse; suppose it had happened with the camera attached!”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-17" id="chapter8_17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">As Guy told Breasted, they had therefore taken the liberty of ordering another balloon, “this time of stouter, non-expanding material,” and were hoping that it would arrive soon, so that they could take a complete set of pictures and create a photographic mosaic of the top of the tell as it was at the moment. It did, in fact, arrive soon thereafter, in mid-December, but only after they had stopped digging for the winter. Guy was also seriously considering acquiring a “kite-balloon capable of lifting a man” and made the prescient observation that aerial photography “will be a commonplace before many years are past,” concluding, “I feel that the Institute might well lead the way.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-18" id="chapter8_18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> Eventually, they were able to take aerial photos of the entire summit of the mound and created two photographic mosaics; one was sent to Chicago and the other was kept at the site. Guy also noted, by the by, that they had additionally acquired an “extensible ladder, of the type used for cleaning street lamps,” which expanded to a height of nearly ten meters. They were able to use this on days when it was too windy to send up the balloon.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-19" id="chapter8_19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Breasted was optimistic and buoyed by Guy’s final letters of 1929. He was elated at the possibility of recovering the entire plan of Solomon’s city at Megiddo and then continuing below to get to the Egyptian levels, for both of which he had been impatiently waiting. He was also pleased at the results of the innovative balloon photography and, on a different topic altogether, was curious to know whether beginning a second dump, on the western side of the mound, would speed up the excavation.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-20" id="chapter8_20" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Guy was also optimistic, writing back in late January 1930 with some thoughts of his own for the coming season. He didn’t think beginning a second dump on the western side of the mound was a good idea, for a variety of reasons, but largely because clearing an area for it would greatly slow <span aria-label="132" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_132" role="doc-pagebreak" title="132"></span>them down. However, he too was looking forward to exposing the entirety of what he thought was the Solomonic city, including what might be “the governor’s palace” lying underneath the high ground in Squares Q8 and Q9, which he suggested could be “bigger than the great stables.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-21" id="chapter8_21" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Breasted also initiated what seems to have been a groundbreaking second innovation for Middle Eastern archaeology. In early February, he instructed Guy to start using the new <i>Munsell Book of Color</i>, a copy of which was sent for his use.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-22" id="chapter8_22" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> This is a system for precisely identifying colors, using a combination of hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity). First introduced for use in the art world, it was adopted by the Oriental Institute in 1930 for use at all of their overseas excavations as a means of describing and recording the color of the soil as they dug through it—for example, a particular shade of brown soil might be described in an excavation report as 10YR 5/3. This would allow another archaeologist to turn to the relevant page in the Munsell book (though archaeologists most likely already have the numbering system memorized and can picture the color in their mind).<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-23" id="chapter8_23" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The Munsell color system is now used by almost all archaeological excavations around the world on a routine basis, but since the new version of the book had just appeared the previous year, in 1929, it seems possible that the Chicago teams were among the first in the world, if not actually the first, to use it in the field. The letter sent to Guy as an accompaniment to the book stated that it was being used in art schools across the nation, and that the Art Department at the University of Chicago highly recommended it. The question remains, how did it occur to Breasted to use it for archaeological purposes (or who suggested it to him)? That is not yet clear.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">In any event, spring came early that year, with the rains holding off, so already by late April 1930 they had put in twenty-six days of work, clearing the southwest corner of the mound. The later strata were absent there, which meant that they could “get through more quickly to good things below.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-24" id="chapter8_24" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The lack of timely detailed reports about their work on the mound began to contribute to Breasted’s growing frustration with Guy, although it would take four more years for that to come to a head. At the end of the year, in mid-December, Guy said he was sending a letter “with the details of the season,” but it was not until the beginning of the next February, in 1931, that Guy actually got around to sending the one and only full report that he wrote to Breasted with the archaeological details of the 1930 season.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-25" id="chapter8_25" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="133" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_133" role="doc-pagebreak" title="133"></span>However, it is in mid-May, from a diary entry made by Janet Woolman rather than a report from Guy, that we get an inkling of the most important discovery made that season. “Walked up around Tel before tea,” she wrote<i>.</i> “The digging going ahead furiously. Curious things happening, such as a deep pit with rubble pavement at bottom and no walls found as yet.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-26" id="chapter8_26" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">As it turned out, this was not just a “deep pit.” It was a steep entrance leading down to the water tunnel that served the site for more than a thousand years, most likely from the Bronze Age until the end of the occupation of the mound. But it would take much work over the next season to realize this and excavate it fully, long after the Woolmans had left the dig.</p>

      <p class="TX">As for the actual digging, we have as little information about the fall season as we do about the spring season earlier in the year. In one letter that Breasted received in late November, Guy wrote that they were “putting in as much digging as possible before the rains descend upon us.” He reported that they had begun to move some of the latest ruins, so that the plan of everything below would be clearer. Subsequently, writing in mid-December, Guy said that they had ended on the eighth and that he was sending a separate letter on the results (which he did, but not until February, as noted). Here, he said, he would mention only that they had comparatively little in the way of small finds, but that “the whole of the tell is now laid bare … and there is a good deal of interesting material to be seen.” He concluded, “We have shifted a tremendous amount of stuff in order to get it, and the results of the season may be said to be satisfactory without being thrilling.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-27" id="chapter8_27" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Guy finally sent a full report on the season’s activities to Breasted in early February 1931.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-28" id="chapter8_28" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> It was a very long letter, but he actually said very little of substance in it, all of which can be boiled down to a few very specific topics or points. First, they had spent most of the season removing the rest of the surface soil across the top of the mound (what we would call “top soil” in today’s terminology). He now wanted to take aerial photos of the entire area, layer by layer, but had been held back by a lack of hydrogen for the balloon, which he was hoping would arrive soon. They had also continued to dig on the East Slope of the mound, he said, with the intention of enlarging their dumping area. Furthermore, they had continued to trace an outer defensive wall in that region and even found several more tombs in the area.</p>

      <p class="TX">Second, they had made modifications to the railway system. The principal modification had been made to the “Great Northern” line, as they called it, which used to go past the stables and across Schumacher’s trench. Now <span aria-label="134" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_134" role="doc-pagebreak" title="134"></span>it had been reconfigured to run directly from the city gate to the dump, which meant that they didn’t have to use the chutes for this line. In turn, this meant that there were only two railway lines using the chutes, which eased up on the congestion that they had previously faced. In addition, by rerouting this line, they had been able to find and clear the approach road to the city gate for some distance down the side of the tell, and now they could walk on what he called the “Solomonic paving stones” of this roadway, right up to and then through the city gate.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-29" id="chapter8_29" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Third, he had been thinking about the final publication of the material that had been uncovered during the previous excavation seasons. He envisioned this as providing an introduction to the site and an explanation of their excavation and recording system. It would also contain a consideration of all of the material found in the surface soil as well as all of the objects that they had found in Schumacher’s dumps while in the process of removing them. Practically all of the plates for the volume were ready, he said, as well as the descriptive lists of what was pictured on them, so it is certainly bewildering that Guy was not able to find time to write the accompanying text during his tenure.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-30" id="chapter8_30" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> The material was left for Lamon and Shipton to publish as part of their <i>Megiddo I</i> volume nearly a decade later, in 1939.</p>

      <p class="TX">Finally, looking ahead to the upcoming season, Guy was optimistic that they would finish removing the Stratum II material, then turn their attention to Stratum Sub-II and remove that in turn, so that by the time of their summer break they would have their Strata III and IV completely visible all over the mound.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-31" id="chapter8_31" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> This was an ambitious plan in the extreme, and, needless to say, they didn’t get anywhere close to achieving these goals during the season.</p>

      <p class="TX">In fact, it must have been a bit disheartening and demoralizing to consider that by then there had been five full seasons (1926–30) of excavation since Fisher first arrived at the mound, and yet here they were still scrabbling about in the first few levels, which Guy admitted were extremely confusing and difficult to date. Although they must have had their suspicions, given the height of the mound, they did not yet know that there were still many more levels to excavate before they reached the earliest occupation levels of this ancient site.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">In the meantime, the intriguing “deep pit with rubble pavement” about which Janet Woolman wrote in her May 1930 diary entry took over center stage as soon as they all returned for the 1931 spring season. It was in early <span aria-label="135" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_135" role="doc-pagebreak" title="135"></span>February that Guy told Breasted that they were going to continue digging out the depression that they could see by Squares P4 and Q4. He was “practically certain that this leads to the water supply.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-32" id="chapter8_32" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> They started work on Sunday, 22 March, and by mid-June he was able to send Breasted the long cable quoted above, in which he first announced the enormous dimensions of the water tunnel.</p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">He followed it up with a letter two weeks later, which is notable both for its length (eight pages, of which nearly half were taken up with a description of excavating the tunnel) and its passion. It was the first time that Guy sounded excited about archaeology since they had found the stables several years earlier. A brief account of their findings appeared in the third revised edition of the Oriental Institute handbook later that year, as well as the following year in the newly established journal <i>Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine</i> (<i>QDAP</i>), as part of the report that was now required each year from each ongoing excavation in the region.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-33" id="chapter8_33" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="136" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_136" role="doc-pagebreak" title="136"></span>It seems that the depression that they had begun excavating had expanded until it measured fully thirty meters wide. It was so large that they had begun digging in Square O5 as well, where they found a stone stairway that led down into what was now clearly the top of a large shaft cut down through the occupation levels, which Guy described as funnel-shaped. The first staircase led down to a second one, which led down farther, spiraling “like a square-cut left-handed corkscrew,” along the side of a shaft seven meters across that was cut through solid rock.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-34" id="chapter8_34" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In all, the shaft and the staircases went straight down at least 20 meters before connecting to a rock-cut tunnel that sloped down at an angle for another 14 meters; at that point, a connecting horizontal tunnel led southwest for an additional 50 meters (so, all told, about 100 feet down and another 150 feet straight out). The tunnel was 3 meters high and 2 meters wide (about 10 feet by 6 feet), allowing people standing upright to pass through it easily.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-35" id="chapter8_35" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">At the farthest end of the tunnel was a vast chamber, Guy said, hewn out of the living rock. He was not exaggerating, for they later recorded it as seven meters high and five meters wide. In the floor of the chamber there was a large water hole, with abundant water still present at the bottom. The water, both here and in a few holes in the floor of the tunnel, was “sweet and drinkable,” according to Guy. He also noted that the water was immediately replenished if they drew any of it off, so that he identified it, quite properly, as the general subterranean water table.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-36" id="chapter8_36" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The chamber extended for a total length of twenty-three meters, at which point the excavators uncovered a blocking wall that was almost perfectly square—four and a half meters wide and five meters high. Guy noted that this was composed of huge stones that had been put in place from the outside, and that its inner face was plastered with mud, in which the “finger-smears” of the workmen “are still plainly to be seen”—thousands of years later.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-37" id="chapter8_37" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Just inside the blocking wall, in an alcove up near its top, Guy thought that they had found a guard post, with a little border of stones around its front. There was an area blackened with smoke, perhaps where the guard had placed his lamp, and a big stone with a concave top where he may have sat. The guard himself was also still there, or what remained of him, for he had died at his post, according to Guy. Next to his skeleton they found the head of a fine bronze mace, but Guy said that they couldn’t be certain <span aria-label="137" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_137" role="doc-pagebreak" title="137"></span>whether it belonged to the guard or was part of the weapon that had caused his death.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-38" id="chapter8_38" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">Lamon also thought that the man, who seems to have been about thirty years old at the time of his death, had been guarding the cave and the water source. He hypothesized that the guard had been the victim of a hostile attack and “met with sudden death ‘with his boots on.’ ” Forgotten, he was <span aria-label="138" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_138" role="doc-pagebreak" title="138"></span>simply left where he fell, possibly even at an early date while access to the water was still only from the southern entrance and before the actual water system had been built to access it from inside the city.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-39" id="chapter8_39" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">We should note, however, that cold water has recently been poured on both Guy’s and Lamon’s suggestions, and the story has been deep-sixed, for Anabel Zarzecki-Peleg, of Hebrew University, has recently suggested that the “guard’s post” may actually be a rock-cut oval burial niche, and that the body may date to the Middle Bronze Age but was disturbed by the later activities involving the water system.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-40" id="chapter8_40" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> If so, there was no guard who died defending his post and the water system, which is much less romantic but also explains why nobody came back for his body to bury him: he was already buried! However, even this does not explain why the body was left in place in antiquity, rather than being moved, reburied, or thrown out. It is unlikely that it escaped notice during the construction and renovations of the tunnel system, the large chamber, and the blocking wall, so we are left to ponder the mystery, as happens so often in archaeology.</p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="139" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_139" role="doc-pagebreak" title="139"></span>The large chamber also had a stairway running up one side and leading to the outside, meaning that the water had originally been accessible from the other direction as well, or perhaps initially only from that direction. This turned out to be an area located at the southern foot of the tell, as Guy later discovered. However, the blocking wall had been constructed at some point, possibly after the system had been in use for some time, so that entry (or exit) on this end was no longer possible. The only way in to the water source was now through the tunnel inside the city wall.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-41" id="chapter8_41" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> All signs of the other access point were most likely erased, so that the city would be safer in time of siege.</p>

      <p class="TX">When this was done is unclear, though some scholars suggest that this was at a later stage in the system’s history, when the inhabitants were more worried about coming under attack. However, it may have been at the same time as other modifications were made, including further work done to the floor of the tunnel so that it sloped from the large chamber down to the foot of the staircase. This allowed the water to run down the tunnel on its own and fill the vertical shaft so that it was now—for all intents and purposes—a deep well. There are some who suggest that this might have been done right away and that the entire system functioned as a large well right from the beginning, rather than having three separate stages in its history as Lamon thought, but for the moment the debate continues.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-42" id="chapter8_42" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Guy said that at one point he took “the gang” outside and positioned them at a point in their Square Q2 where he thought they were immediately above the blocking wall and the chamber. They dug down four meters and, sure enough, reached the outer part of the blocking wall. Jubilantly, he recorded the fact that “from inside the chamber, I have heard the tapping of the pickmen working on the outside, just as it is related in the Siloam Inscription.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-43" id="chapter8_43" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> This inscription, etched in what is now known as Hezekiah’s Tunnel in Jerusalem, reads in part:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="EX">While [the stone-cutters were wielding] the picks, each toward his co-worker, and while there were still three cubits to tunnel through, the voice of a man was heard calling out to his co-worker, because there was a fissure in the rock, running from south [to north].<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-44" id="chapter8_44" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="TX">The excavation of this entire water system was exhilarating, as one might imagine, but also a nightmare for Guy and his team. The work was extremely difficult, as Guy noted; at one point he had a chain of ninety to a hundred <span aria-label="140" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_140" role="doc-pagebreak" title="140"></span>men passing the newly dug earth from the working face to the surface, but the air was so foul that they could work for only a few hours at a time. It was also “pitch dark past the foot of the stairs,” as he put it, and so they decided to install a permanent electrical system, taking advantage of the new 110-volt system to which they had just upgraded. This enabled them not only to have light but also to have fans that “allowed the air to remain fairly good and have made all-day work possible.” This meant, though, running heavy electrical wires over a distance of half a kilometer, in order to supply the lamps and fans with the necessary electricity. They also placed railway tracks along the floor of the tunnel, which made transporting the excavation debris much faster and easier, and also cut down on the number of men who were needed in the tunnel.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-45" id="chapter8_45" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Parker was invaluable throughout, working “like a Trojan,” according to Guy, who no doubt intended it as the highest compliment. He said that Parker invented all kinds of devices to speed up the work and make it run more smoothly, and did much of the carpentry himself. There were also very few accidents, although Reis Hamid (the headman of the Egyptian workmen) was once knocked unconscious when three waterlogged baskets were dropped on him from the top of the shaft. After that, Guy said, workmen were fined whenever they dropped something, which immediately decreased the occurrence of such incidents.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-46" id="chapter8_46" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In the end, Guy heaped praise upon Breasted in far-off Chicago, noting that “it is only an expedition with resources such as you have secured that could have done the job.” He pointed out, with satisfaction, that Macalister had never completed the excavation of the water tunnel at Gezer, but that he (Guy) had “been determined that there should be no abandonment at Megiddo, and that wherever it led, or whatever obstacles we encountered, we would get to the end of that tunnel.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-47" id="chapter8_47" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Intriguingly, we still don’t know when the tunnel was first built or when it went out of use. It is clear from Guy’s letter to Breasted in 1931 that he thought it was originally dug very early, perhaps during the Bronze Age in the second millennium BCE, though he noted that there had been subsequent alterations, blockings, and reopenings.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-48" id="chapter8_48" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">However, by the time Lamon published the final report on the water system, in 1935, he observed that the top part of the shaft cut through a Late Bronze Age level, and that an earlier external accessway to the water source (Gallery 629) probably dated to about 1200 BCE, so he suggested that the water tunnel system was first constructed late in the Bronze Age, approxi<span aria-label="141" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_141" role="doc-pagebreak" title="141"></span>mately 1150 BCE or soon thereafter, which would correlate with the time of troubles and the collapse of the Canaanites in the Levant at that time. In a letter that he sent to Breasted a bit earlier, in mid-October 1934, just after they had finished all work in the tunnel, Lamon wrote: “According to my arguments, the water system is fairly definitely dated as having been constructed during the twelfth century, but was used at various subsequent times up to as late as the Greco-Persian period. The original ‘cave well’ was used before the shaft and tunnel came into existence—during the twelfth century—and probably goes right back to the earliest history of Megiddo.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-49" id="chapter8_49" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Yadin, however, writing in the 1960s and 1970s, thought that the construction of the water tunnel dated to Stratum IVA, which would place it during the Iron Age, in the ninth century BCE or later.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-50" id="chapter8_50" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> Many scholars still cite this date, as well as Yadin’s arguments, for the construction of the water system,<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-51" id="chapter8_51" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> although there have been a few alternative suggestions tweaking the various stages during its lifetime proposed in the interim. Among these is the hypothesis of Norma Franklin, an archaeologist who worked for many years at Megiddo as part of the Tel Aviv team from 1992 onward. She suggests that the system may have been first dug earlier, in the Middle Bronze Age, just as Guy had thought.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-52" id="chapter8_52" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In my opinion, the jury is still out. While I do not agree with Yadin and would argue that the shaft and tunnel were most likely in place by at least the twelfth century, as Lamon thought, I would also point to the recently renewed excavations at the very similar water tunnel at Gezer—the one that Macalister did not finish excavating a century ago—which seem to indicate construction in the Middle Bronze Age.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-53" id="chapter8_53" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> If so, and if the system at Megiddo was contemporary, it would mean that Guy was correct about the Middle Bronze Age origins for this one at Megiddo after all.</p>

      <p class="TX">Guy also noted that there were bees’ and wasps’ nests in the roof and on the walls of the big chamber, which he thought could only have been made before the blocking wall was built. Without giving a firm basis for his thought process, he tentatively suggested that this—that is, the construction of the blocking wall, the sealing up of the entrance from the south, and the disguising of the location of the water source—would have taken place during the early part of the Iron Age. He also said that they had taken samples of these nests for an entomologist named Buxton to examine and had asked him to determine whether the particular species still existed in British Mandate Palestine. Unfortunately, we do not know the results.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-54" id="chapter8_54" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="142" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_142" role="doc-pagebreak" title="142"></span>As for when the water system went out of use, Lamon suggested that the system might still have been in use to a certain extent through the time of Josiah, in 609 BCE—that is, during Stratum II—but wasn’t sure when it finally went out of use.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-55" id="chapter8_55" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> Guy thought that he detected Hellenistic sherds among the debris in the tunnel and the large chamber. In the brief report published in the 1932 <i>QDAP</i> volume, he wrote specifically that he had found “late pottery, including a sherd of black Greek ware, low down in the shaft” of the water system. That, plus the fact that the stairway led all the way up to the surface of the tell (and was not covered over by later strata), suggested to him that the system remained in use “practically down to the latest period of occupation.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-56" id="chapter8_56" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Nobody else has really ventured a guess as to why and when the tunnel was finally allowed to silt up. Since water was still present and “sweet” to the taste when Guy and his team cleared out the chamber, it seems likely that the system was still technically functional right up until the end; in other words, the water had not dried up. I would suspect that the system may well have gone out of use toward the end of the Persian period and the abandonment of the site ca. 350 BCE, but it is possible that it took place earlier.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Overall, during the first half of the 1931 season, until digging stopped on 7 July, Guy’s efforts were focused on clearing additional squares on the East Slope and removing the latest remains from the top of the tell, as well as working in the water system. They found a number of tombs on the East Slope, some of them apparently dating to the Early Bronze Age, including one that contained forty-eight skulls as well as many other bones. Other tombs yielded scarabs of Thutmose III and Ramses II, so it had been a successful season thus far. When he wrote to Breasted at the end of June, they had already put in eighty-three days of work, which Guy noted was more than during any other season.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-57" id="chapter8_57" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">A week later, just one day before leaving for their summer break, Guy wrote again, telling Breasted just how much earth they had moved in the past several seasons (40,500 square meters in the last three years alone, of which 37,000 were on the top of the mound), and reiterating: “I have already spoken about getting down to the Thutmose III level in my letter of 30 June. Do please believe that I want to reach it every bit as much as you do, and it <span aria-label="143" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_143" role="doc-pagebreak" title="143"></span>is only my knowledge of the tell, and my hatred of archaeological crimes of a type so often committed, that force me to counsel prudence.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-58" id="chapter8_58" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Guy planned to return from his summer break on 27 September, and the fall digging season probably began shortly thereafter.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-59" id="chapter8_59" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> However, we cannot be entirely sure, nor do we know what was discovered, for there are very few letters exchanged during the month of October and almost nothing extant from November or December. We do have a cable that Guy sent to Breasted in early December, congratulating him on the dedication of the new building in Chicago for the Oriental Institute. There was also yet another personnel issue that arose, just to put a finishing touch on the season, and so cables were exchanged on 10–11 December regarding permission for Engberg to winter in the Chicago accommodations in Luxor because of an ailment from which he eventually recovered.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-60" id="chapter8_60" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">When we next have a letter from Guy, it is a full month later, on 10 January 1932. During the fall of 1931, they had been able to dig for much longer than usual, he said, and so the season had only just ended three days earlier. However, he included no news about what they had found, saying only that he had just finally sent his Egyptian workmen home for a well-deserved winter break.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter8-61" id="chapter8_61" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> Little did any of them know what yet lay in store for them later that year and into the next.</p>
