      <h1 class="CTT"><b>“The Stratigraphical Skeleton”</b></h1>

      <p class="CO">When the team reassembled for the 1938–39 season, yet another new member joined them, for Loud had gotten married just before the season began. His bride was Honor Merrell, a young lady active on the social and philanthropic scene in Chicago. The ceremony was held in early November at the Fourth Presbyterian Church, an imposing neo-Gothic edifice on East Chestnut Street in the Magnificent Mile neighborhood of Chicago. Loud looked quite dashing in his top hat, while the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> described the bride as wearing “a cream-colored satin dress with a high neck, long sleeves and a long train.” Charley Altman served as an usher, while Hal Noble, a close friend of Loud’s (whom we will meet again) served as the best man.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-1" id="chapter15_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Following the small ceremony, and a larger reception at her parents’ house nearby on Lake Shore Drive, they departed a few days later on the SS <i>Conte di Savoia</i>.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-2" id="chapter15_2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The Italian ocean liner was just six years old at the time and was the first ever fitted with gyroscopic stabilizers designed to create a smoother trip across the Atlantic.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-3" id="chapter15_3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> They headed to Sicily for a honeymoon and then directly to British Mandate Palestine, arriving at Megiddo by mid-December. Parker was already there, and the Altmans, Pope, and Shipton showed up a week later. As usual, Loud immediately wrote to Hamilton, who had been recently promoted to director of the Department of Antiquities and was awaiting news of their arrival. Loud requested a license to dig for the year and, also as usual, Hamilton replied promptly and positively.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-4" id="chapter15_4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Work began five days later, with scheduled workdays that now lasted from 6:45 a.m. to 3:55 p.m. Loud wrote to Matthews a few days later that it was “a great joy to have work under way again.” He was pleased to report that everything was peaceful at Megiddo—he hadn’t received any threatening letters yet; the workmen were delighted to be back at work again; and the <span aria-label="275" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_275" role="doc-pagebreak" title="275"></span>local bandits were equally pleased that the villagers now had money which they could steal. He also thought that it was “only a matter of days” before the bandits were all either rounded up or driven off.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-5" id="chapter15_5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Since they had excavated down to bedrock during the previous season, most of the 1938–39 season was spent tying up loose ends. As Loud wrote in his final report, submitted in May, “With the twenty strata and their sub-periods already established, the aim of the 1938/39 season … and of all future seasons is to add flesh to the stratigraphical skeleton and to tie together the several areas which have been excavated in the past.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-6" id="chapter15_6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In addition to continuing their efforts in K-1 (Area DD), they also resumed excavations a bit farther north and east, in the stable area that they had begun during the previous season. In addition, they opened up a new area immediately adjacent to Area BB, fifty meters long from north to south, which connected their east area to Schumacher’s Great Trench. By the end of the season, they had already gone down to Stratum XV in this area.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-7" id="chapter15_7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">However, things started off slowly. By the end of January, Loud confessed to Wilson that it had been “an extremely dull month, both from the standpoint of science and of outside events.” The latter was good; the former not so good.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-8" id="chapter15_8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Loud mentioned that they had found a second liver omen in the area of the original temple within the east area.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-9" id="chapter15_9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> They had also exposed more remains dating to VII and VIII in K-10, including part of a central courtyard and rooms to the west and north; as he put it, the architecture “is so similar to that of the three main phases of the palace that it is not funny.” As in the palace, there were few objects above floor level, but he was hoping to get some “buried treasure” once they got below the floors.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-10" id="chapter15_10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In the meantime, Wilson wrote to float the idea that he might make a final trip to the Near East in the fall and come to visit them at the beginning of their season, if the political situation and the institute’s finances permitted. Loud replied that he thought it was “a very swell idea,” but the trip never came to pass.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-11" id="chapter15_11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> In part this was because of something to which Wilson referred in his letter—“the London conference”—which he expected would eventually reach “some point with which one party or another will disagree.” This would be followed immediately by fresh disturbances in British Mandate Palestine, he thought, which might affect his planned trip to the Near East. In his response, Loud was a bit more optimistic: “Unless the <span aria-label="276" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_276" role="doc-pagebreak" title="276"></span>London conference completely upsets the applecart, I feel we have nothing to fear.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-12" id="chapter15_12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">What were they talking about? These are the first references to this particular conference in their correspondence, and they continued to mention it several times more over the course of the next few months. Now known as the London Conference of 1939, or, alternatively, as the St James’ Palace Conference, this took place between 7 February and 17 March 1939. During this time, the British government held a series of meetings in London with separate delegations of Arabs and Jews, in an attempt to plan an end to the Mandate and decide how the region was to be governed in the future.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-13" id="chapter15_13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">These resulted in what is now called the “1939 White Paper,” which was issued in mid-May. Among other things, it proposed a limit to Jewish immigration—a maximum of seventy-five thousand new immigrants over the next five years—and restrictions on where Jews could buy land. If no violence erupted in Palestine during the ensuing ten years, power would be transferred to a representative government and the British would withdraw.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-14" id="chapter15_14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Of course, upon publication of this white paper, which some promptly nicknamed the “Black Paper,” renewed violence broke out in British Mandate Palestine, just as Wilson—and much of the rest of the world—had feared. According to the historian Tom Segev, David Ben Gurion wrote in his diary, “Satan himself could not have created a more distressing and horrible nightmare.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-15" id="chapter15_15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Fortunately for Loud and the rest of the team at Megiddo, the issuance of this white paper came a few days after they had closed up the site for the season and left the country, as we will see in a moment.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Meanwhile, the team received word in late January that Lind and his wife, Astrid, had gotten divorced, apparently at her parents’ urging. She was now back in Sweden while he remained on his new orchard south of Haifa.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-16" id="chapter15_16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> At the dig house, things were still peaceful, although there was some consternation when a local rebel leader—not the one we’ve met who possessed official stationery—sent Loud two chickens. It eventually became clear that the chickens were meant as a gift, rather than a threat, and an indication that the brigand wished to come chat with Loud.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-17" id="chapter15_17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Even though he showed up “armed to the teeth,” as Loud described it later to Wilson, it turned out that the rebel was indeed friendly, and that he had an ulterior motive as well: his younger brother was one of the workers <span aria-label="277" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_277" role="doc-pagebreak" title="277"></span>at the dig, and the leader wanted to make certain that the young man was protected from potential harm, since he was not a member of the gang. As an aside, Loud made the very interesting observation that the “rebel friendliness is clear from the fact that this is the only expedition house in all Palestine which was not destroyed during the past summer.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-18" id="chapter15_18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">At about the same time, the team was visited by a group from the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. The group was led by Nelson Glueck, who was now the director. Glueck’s account of their visit is worth quoting in full:<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-19" id="chapter15_19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="EX">Arriving near Megiddo, we stopped on the road, and had [a] picnic lunch, photographed the great mound, and then drove up to the house of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, which has for years now been conducting remarkably productive excavations at Megiddo. The present Director of the excavations is Mr. Gordon Loud, and this is, I believe, now his third season there. We were warmly received by him, and Mrs. Loud, and the rest of the staff, and were promptly served with delicious Turkish coffee. I am glad to report that all is well with them. The excavations are proceeding apace. Mr. Loud spent several hours with us showing us around, and explaining in detail the course of the excavations, where during the two previous years some phenomenal finds have been made. I also had a particularly satisfactory conversation with Geoffrey Shipton regarding Bronze Age ledge-handles found in Palestine, and their relationship to those found by our School during the course of the archaeological survey of Transjordan. He and Robert M. Engberg had previously published the Notes on the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age of Palestine, which has become of basic importance for the study of Palestinian pottery, and in which a large section is devoted to ledge-handles. We left Megiddo at about 4 P.M.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="TX">Fisher was on the trip too, as Loud noted in his field diary that day, although Glueck didn’t mention him in his newsletter account. Loud took the opportunity to show Fisher a copy of Guy’s <i>Megiddo Tombs</i> volume, which had finally been published and had just arrived a day or so before. Although Loud noted that the volume set “a high standard for us to live up to in our future publications,” he also reported that Fisher wasn’t too enthusiastic about it.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-20" id="chapter15_20" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Small wonder, since it included the sixty tombs that he had excavated back in 1925–26 but had never published.</p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="278" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_278" role="doc-pagebreak" title="278"></span>Loud also received a rather surprising notice in late January, from the district officer in Jenin, informing him that one of the local landowners, Feiz Saad, the son of Hassan Saad with whom Fisher had dealt back in 1925, was now demanding that the team pay him rent going all the way back to 1928. He had retained a lawyer named Asfour, who had filed papers and was demanding action. It seems that this was a saga that kept popping up from time to time, with never any final resolution to the matter, but this time its reemergence had been prompted by a land court decision handed down the previous November that had somehow affected the expropriation of their land in particular. Loud therefore informed Wilson of the new developments and then contacted the government’s representative, a man named Wadsworth.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-21" id="chapter15_21" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Although it took a while, Wadsworth eventually informed Loud that the team need not worry; even if rent were owed, the government would handle it, since they had never finished expropriating the land. In fact, as previously mentioned, the case eventually simply ended when the new Israeli government took control of the land following the 1948 War of Independence.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Meanwhile, the British military had been doing roundups periodically in Lejjun—usually on payday, as Loud noted. In the first roundup, back on 1 January, two men had been killed while trying to escape. In the second roundup, four days later, Loud reported that planes “were flying all around the village and us, some actually firing on the path between Lejun [<i>sic</i>] and the mound while the workmen were on their way over, this apparently because leaflets had been dropped on the village saying that all who ventured out of doors would be shot.” Eight of their workmen were taken off to prison, reportedly for three months.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-22" id="chapter15_22" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">During the third such roundup, which took place in the middle of January, Loud said that the planes came in firing again, “this time … so close to the house that it was decidedly unpleasant.” This was because more than thirty local men were hiding in and around the dig house, including in the chicken coop and various other locations. In the end, their local foreman, Fareed, was detained, despite the fact that Loud needed him.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-23" id="chapter15_23" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In spite of all this, on the digging side things were still proceeding as planned, well into February. The weather was unusually good, with little rain, and they were continuing to remove quantities of earth, revealing nu<span aria-label="279" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_279" role="doc-pagebreak" title="279"></span>merous walls and routine objects. Nothing spectacular had yet been uncovered, Loud said, but “everyone is well, no one has been robbed or shot at, and military operations seem to avoid our area.” By now they had finished the initial K-10 area and had moved slightly to the east and south, in order to enlarge the area. They unearthed more stables in this area, connected to others that Guy had previously excavated, and then quickly removed them. They had also gone deeper in the area where Stable 5082 had been; Loud thought that they were by now in Strata IX–XI at this point and included photos in his letters to demonstrate his points.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-24" id="chapter15_24" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Then, toward the end of February, Loud said that one day at noon a truck driver from Haifa brought a false report that the London conference had resulted in Arab demands being fulfilled, and that Arab independence would be coming soon. The resulting impromptu celebration by their workmen led to a cancellation of work, both that afternoon and the following day. However, just a day after that, two bombs went off in Haifa, one in the railway station and the other in the marketplace.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-25" id="chapter15_25" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Unrest was heating up again, this time not so far from them.</p>

      <p class="TX">By March, when it rained for an entire fortnight straight, Loud reported that work had continued in both K-10 and the stable area, but that their digging “still fails to produce anything to get excited about.” Also, the military still hadn’t released their foreman and had in fact sentenced him to three months’ detention. “Maybe he did associate with the brigands,” said Loud, “but after all who hasn’t?” They had about two hundred workers at the time, of whom about half were young boys, who were probably acting as the bucket runners—taking the full buckets and emptying them into the railway cars. Loud also attached a sketch plan, to better show Wilson and Matthews where they had been working.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-26" id="chapter15_26" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">To all of this, Wilson replied—much as he had the previous season—that despite their not finding many “goodies,” it was extremely valuable that Loud had tied together the north, east, gate, and stables areas and connected them as much as possible to Schumacher’s Great Trench. As he put it: “From the standpoint of objects, Megiddo has already given brilliantly. We need such work as you are doing at present to make a closer control.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-27" id="chapter15_27" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">At about the same time as he wrote to Wilson, in early March, Loud also wrote to Matthews, saying that conditions were tense in the area, while “Arabs and Jews are speculating on the outcome of the London doings.” He predicted that there was a fresh wave of terrorism coming, but he hoped it <span aria-label="280" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_280" role="doc-pagebreak" title="280"></span>wouldn’t last long and wouldn’t affect them. Ten days later he mentioned the situation again, writing, “Everyone still awaits the outcome of the London conference, hoping that something will be settled soon.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-28" id="chapter15_28" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">He also told Wilson that “the air has been tense throughout the country since the first intimations of Arab independence were announced.” Since his letter to Matthews at the beginning of the month, there had been fresh outbreaks of terrorism in the towns, and “there doubtless will be more and worse to come,” he said. However, he didn’t think that they had anything to fear at Megiddo, for they were in good standing with the villagers, and the local rebel leader had called on them several more times, for coffee and a chat. Loud did ask Wilson to keep that last bit of information under his hat, “for the military’s attitude apparently is that anyone not out to get the brigands is cooperating with them.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-29" id="chapter15_29" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In response, Wilson noted: “You still seem to operate despite rumors and alarms originating from the negotiations in London. I wonder what will happen in your region when Britain imposes a settlement. I hope that, as in the past, it need make no difference to you in your relations to the locals.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-30" id="chapter15_30" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> In fact, although the announcement of the 1939 White Paper was still more than a month away at the time, the violence was already beginning to increase. Just a few days after Wilson wrote in early April, news arrived at Megiddo that their good friend Iliffe had been shot and severely wounded by a would-be assassin in Jerusalem.</p>

      <p class="TX">Glueck recounted the events a few days later.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-31" id="chapter15_31" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> It seems that Iliffe had come to pick up his wife at the American School late on a Monday afternoon. Glueck and Iliffe spent some time talking together about various archaeological matters, and so the Iliffes finally left at about 7:15 p.m., driving to their house, which was only about three blocks away. Not three minutes later, Glueck heard two shots fired, followed by a phone call from Mrs. Iliffe, who was screaming, “My God, my husband has been shot. Help!” Iliffe had been the victim of a targeted attack, in which the assassin(s) hid outside their house and waited for him to come home.</p>

      <p class="TX">Accompanied by two policemen, Glueck dashed to Iliffe’s house and found him lying on the couch, bleeding from a gunshot wound to his chest. The first bullet had missed, but the second punctured his right lung before exiting his body. They rushed Iliffe to the hospital, where he immediately received intensive medical care that saved his life.</p>

      <p class="TX">Loud recorded in his field diary that he had heard on the radio that Iliffe had been shot. The news also reached Chicago; Matthews wrote to Loud <span aria-label="281" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_281" role="doc-pagebreak" title="281"></span>that they had been shaken “to learn almost simultaneously of the shooting of Iliffe, the death of King Feisal of Iraq, and the murder of the British Consul at Mosul.” As he noted, it was reassuring to later learn from Loud’s letters that things were quiet at Megiddo, “but we shall feel more relieved when we know you have embarked for the return journey to America.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-32" id="chapter15_32" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> As for Iliffe, it took him several long months of convalescence, but eventually he recovered enough to resume his duties at the Palestine Archaeological Museum.</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Despite the increasing violence, April produced some of their best results of the season, at least in terms of architecture. They did also find a bone “magic wand,” as they called it, with an Egyptian inscription upon it, which they were unable to translate right away. More importantly, they had reached Stratum XV below the stable area and had revealed three separate buildings all with essentially the same ground plan—a portico with two columns in front, a large central room, and then a smaller room at the back. This is usually called a “megaron” type plan. Such buildings are found primarily in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, first as stand-alone buildings, as at Megiddo, and then later—for instance, at the site of Mycenae in Greece during the Late Bronze Age—often incorporated as the main part of a king’s palace.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-33" id="chapter15_33" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In his letters to Wilson and in his field diary, as well as in the final report that he submitted to the Department of Antiquities, Loud first called these “hilani” buildings, but those are more specifically North Syrian in origin and more usually later in time, that is, Iron Age. Already by August, Loud had caught this and asked the department to change “hilani” to read “megaron” before the report was published, which they did. In the final publication, he specifically noted that such megara (the plural) were “usually associated with but not confined to the Mycenaean Aegean world” and cited in particular a similar grouping of such buildings from the second city at Troy, which dated to about 2400 BCE. Here at Megiddo, these megara in Stratum XV, which dated to about the same time, seem to have served as temples. In fact, the large round stone altar that Loud had found the previous season could now be seen to go with one of the three buildings (Temple 4040), standing immediately behind it and obviously related to it in this level.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-34" id="chapter15_34" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Toward the end of April, Immanuel Ben-Dor, who would later become the deputy director of antiquities after 1948, was sent to conduct the division <span aria-label="282" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_282" role="doc-pagebreak" title="282"></span>of the antiquities at Megiddo, since Iliffe was still in the hospital at the time. The digging had ended a week earlier.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-35" id="chapter15_35" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> In making the arrangements, Loud mentioned to Hamilton that Ben-Dor might want to stay in Haifa rather than at Megiddo. Although they were happy to house him at Megiddo, Loud wrote, “I regret to admit that we are absolutely at the mercy of the ‘hill men’ ”—that is, the rebels. He hastened to add that the “hill men” had been nothing but friendly so far, and that “we ourselves are safe enough and our guests probably are too, providing a Government representative isn’t too tempting.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-36" id="chapter15_36" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">Perhaps not surprisingly, given what had just happened to Iliffe, albeit in Jerusalem, Ben-Dor opted to stay in Haifa and make his way to and from Megiddo during daylight hours. In fact, Loud recorded in his field diary that Ben-Dor arrived in a taxi as part of a larger convoy and then returned to Haifa escorted by an armored car that had been specifically sent to accompany him back.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-37" id="chapter15_37" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The division didn’t go as smoothly as it usually did, since Ben-Dor didn’t have the authority to act on his own initiative as Iliffe was able to do. How<span aria-label="283" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_283" role="doc-pagebreak" title="283"></span>ever, later, after filing a complaint that the government had taken all of the best finds from the season, rather than splitting them as usual, Loud made a personal trip to Jerusalem to pursue the matter further. In the end, both parties agreed to a fair division, and Loud ultimately arranged for an additional set of crates full of “antikas,” as they called them, to be sent back to Chicago in mid-May.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-38" id="chapter15_38" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The team then split up for the summer, unaware that it would be for the last time. After visiting Iliffe in the hospital in early May, Loud and his wife, Honor, along with Tony Pope, headed for Athens and a brief vacation and then on to New York, eventually arriving in early June. The Altmans sailed directly to the States on 11 May, while Parker closed up the dig house two days later and then stayed on in Haifa with Shipton for a month, after which Shipton was due to head for Chicago once again, to work on the publications.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-39" id="chapter15_39" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The Americans thus all left British Mandate Palestine just days before the British released the 1939 White Paper on 18 May. Within a week, the anticipated violence began, with shootings and bombings lasting into early June. Loud had written to Matthews several weeks before, “I don’t think any of us … will be sorry to get out when the time comes.” He later similarly told Wilson, “I shan’t … be sorry to leave the tense atmosphere of Palestine behind.” However, they must have despaired when they read the headlines while vacationing in Greece, knowing that Parker and Shipton were still in Haifa at the time.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-40" id="chapter15_40" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">That was not the end of the story, though, for less than three weeks later Shipton wrote with an unexpected announcement. While he knew that Loud and Chicago had assured him of employment for the next two years, he said that, effective immediately, he was taking a job with Spinney’s, the provisioning and distribution company that is still active as a supermarket chain in the Middle East today. He would not be coming to Chicago after all but instead would remain in Haifa, working at the company offices. He also would not be available for the final season at Megiddo.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-41" id="chapter15_41" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Shipton’s letter and its surprising contents arrived like “a Haifa market bomb,” Loud later told him, “blowing to pieces” their publication plans for the remainder of the summer and beyond. It also created obvious personnel problems for their upcoming excavation season, which would have to be dealt with.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-42" id="chapter15_42" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Shipton said that he knew full well this would be a blow to them, and he felt sick at letting them know so suddenly, but although his heart was <span aria-label="284" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_284" role="doc-pagebreak" title="284"></span>really in archaeology, he literally couldn’t afford to pass up this employment offer. “If I had private means, it would be a horse of a very different color,” he wrote, but such was not the case. Moreover, he believed that his lack of schooling meant that archaeology would eventually be a dead end for him, and it would prove impossible to “have made a mark.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-43" id="chapter15_43" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Little did Shipton realize that he would make quite a lasting mark in archaeology anyway, with his two major Megiddo publications. In fact, his book on the pottery from Strata VI–XX had just seen the light of day and may have crossed in the mail with this letter, while the <i>Megiddo I</i> volume that he coauthored with Lamon would be out before the end of the year.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-44" id="chapter15_44" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Shipton’s sudden resignation from the team threw everything into disarray, from the publication plans to the upcoming 1939–40 season. Loud wrote to Shipton in early August, saying that they had decided not to replace him on either the publications or the project, but were hopeful that he would be able to join them once the excavation season started, perhaps on Sundays and on Wednesday afternoons as well, since he would be off work both times. They had also decided not to have a <i>Megiddo II</i> and a <i>Megiddo III</i> volume, but to condense all five seasons (1935–39) into a single volume.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-45" id="chapter15_45" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Shipton replied at once, saying that he would be “more than delighted” to help out with the pottery during the coming season, and that “it will be great fun coming out to Megiddo of a Sunday—and Wednesday afternoon if necessary.” However, he warned Loud that the situation in British Mandate Palestine was extremely tense, as a result of the nonaggression pact between Germany and Russia, and that he was sure “the next few days will bring war.” He had just been sent his officers’ reserve papers and had committed himself to the air force—if war did come, he said, “I may yet be dropping bombs on some unfortunate German towards whom personally I hold no animosity.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-46" id="chapter15_46" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">He also said that while his work at Spinney’s so far was both fun and very interesting, “it does not make up for archaeology by a long shot.” However, he did have a couple of secretaries and was kept busy from 7:30 a.m. until 2 p.m. dictating letters, which made him feel tremendously important, “but it appears I am the only person that thinks so!”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-47" id="chapter15_47" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The summer of 1939 then saw something unprecedented from Megiddo—the beginning of regular letters, from July onward, sent in perfect English and legible handwriting, from Serge Tchoub, the chauffeur whom Loud had almost let go back in 1936. Throughout the coming years, Tchoub and Parker <span aria-label="285" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_285" role="doc-pagebreak" title="285"></span>would maintain a steady flow of letters and information sent first to Wilson and then to his successor at the Oriental Institute, Carl Kraeling, as the two of them maintained the dig house and the vehicles in preparation for another field season that never materialized. At the moment, Tchoub said, Parker and Shipton were in Haifa, where he saw them occasionally. Everything was quiet in the vicinity of Megiddo, with no real rebels in sight, though there were still some small local gangs that were occasionally active.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-48" id="chapter15_48" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">On the last day of August, Tchoub wrote again to say that everything was still okay at Megiddo, if one ignored the malaria that was troublesome during the summer, and that was currently affecting both himself and his wife. Everyone was getting anxious about the very real possibility of war, which was not surprising since Hitler invaded Poland the very next day, on 1 September. Tchoub said that they were all practicing air raid defense, and that some pricing regulations on food had been imposed by the authorities.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-49" id="chapter15_49" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Wilson and Loud did not yet fully realize that the coming excavation season at Megiddo was not to be, nor that there would never be another one for them. Loud sent a cable to Parker in early September: “<small>STILL HOPE RETURN CABLE YOUR PLANS WHEN DEFINITE</small>.” He then wrote to Tchoub later that month, saying that they had been planning to depart in mid-October and to begin work at Megiddo in mid-November, though the war had put those plans on hold. He also wrote to Parker in October and then again in November, pushing the date for their departure back each time.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-50" id="chapter15_50" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">However, none of Loud’s letters were making it through to Tchoub, who wrote again in mid-October asking about their plans for the season and requesting that all future letters be sent as registered mail, so as to guarantee delivery. The workmen, he said, “still hope and expect the beginning of work this season,” and he himself was “anxious to hear from you about the future of Megiddo.” In addition, he said, Parker had moved all of his personal belongings, and those of Shipton, to their apartment in Haifa, located near the sea.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-51" id="chapter15_51" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In mid-November, Loud tried to locate just one more full-time team member—for he rightfully believed that he and Charley Altman would not be able to handle the entire tell operation, even if Shipton were able to make it every Wednesday afternoon and all day on Sundays to look at the pottery. Using as an intermediary his good friend Hal Noble in Philadelphia, who had been the best man at his wedding, Loud contacted Arthur J. Tobler.</p>

      <p class="TX">Tobler had worked on the University of Pennsylvania excavations at the site of Tepe Gawra in northwestern Iraq, near the ancient site of Nineveh, <span aria-label="286" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_286" role="doc-pagebreak" title="286"></span>for a number of seasons from 1936 onward. Interestingly—and a testament to the small interconnected world of archaeology, especially in those days—both Arthur Piepkorn, who had been at Megiddo from May through July 1933, and Immanuel Ben-Dor, who had just come to oversee the division of the 1938–39 finds, had participated as staff members at Tepe Gawra during the 1932–33 season. In fact, Piepkorn had come directly from Tepe Gawra to Megiddo that year, after their season ended in April (as mentioned in a previous chapter).<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-52" id="chapter15_52" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">However, after an initial series of exchanges, which looked promising at first, Tobler ultimately turned Loud down flat. His final cable to Loud read simply, “<small>REGRET CANNOT ACCEPT AT THIS TIME GOOD LUCK</small>.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-53" id="chapter15_53" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Having postponed their departure for British Mandate Palestine three times already, Loud finally capitulated in late November.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-54" id="chapter15_54" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> He wrote to Tchoub, “For several weeks now we have been making plans to return to Megiddo, but it was only last week that we found it will be impossible to come this season.” They were all very disappointed at having to miss a season, he said, and he was especially sorry to disappoint the workmen who would have no work this year. But—ever the optimist—they had “the satisfaction of knowing that we shall return next year.” In the meantime, he said, they were all very busy working on the publication of the material that they had excavated during the previous seasons.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-55" id="chapter15_55" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">It was ironic that they were unable to assemble a staff, Loud told Parker, for “conditions are probably more favorable for digging than during the past two years yet no staff is available.” They would, however, Loud promised, continue to pay Parker’s salary (as they would Tchoub’s), albeit at one-quarter of the previous amount, in return for his looking in on things at the dig house once in a while.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-56" id="chapter15_56" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> Shipton, replying on behalf of both himself and Parker in early December, confirmed that it was indeed now “quiet at the dig—so much more so than it has been for years.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-57" id="chapter15_57" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In a follow-up letter to Tobler, after receiving his final cable turning down their offer, Loud said much the same thing about the irony—it was rather incongruous to be sitting in Chicago, “struggling with publication,” instead of digging in British Mandate Palestine, where all reports were favorable and the country was “far more peaceful than during the past three years.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter15-58" id="chapter15_58" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> Still, he was hopeful that they’d be able to get a team together and dig for one final season. As it turned out, they did not.</p>
