For more discussion, see Cline 2000 with further references. Regarding the mentions of Megiddo in the Bible, see Josh. 12:21, 17:11; Judg. 1:27, 5:19; 1 Kings 4:12, 9:15; 2 Kings 9:27, 23:29, 23:30; 1 Chron. 7:29; 2 Chron. 35:22; Zech. 12:11, and see also Chris McKinny’s blog post at: <a href="http://seekingahomeland.blogspot.co.il/2009/08/megiddos-identification-in-historical.html">http://<wbr/>seekingahomeland<wbr/>.blogspot<wbr/>.co<wbr/>.il<wbr/>/2009<wbr/>/08<wbr/>/megiddos<wbr/>-identification<wbr/>-in<wbr/>-historical<wbr/>.html</a>.</p></li>

Of course, many of these are concerned with its connection to biblical Armageddon, but a very substantial portion are concerned with the actual archaeology of the site. Even in this book, with more than a thousand endnotes and hundreds of entries in the bibliography, I have room to include only those books and articles that are the most germane to the topics being discussed; other detailed scholarly publications pertaining to specific buildings, for instance, can be found, e.g., in Ussishkin 2018.</p></li>

I have been able to cite that book where appropriate in this volume.</p></li>

Janet Woolman’s statements in her letters and diaries from September 1929 through March 1930 probably present a more realistic picture.</p></li>

Instead, after being shown the route northward via a dotted line on the map, we veer abruptly and head for modern Mosul and then the ancient sites of Nineveh and Khorsabad in Iraq, without first hearing any discussion or getting a sense of the work being done at Alishar. I thank Charles E.

As far as I know, these undergraduate senior honors theses represent the only work done to date on this skeletal material at the Smithsonian since the time of Hrdli<span class="en-dcrit">č</span>ka. Note that letters in the Israel Antiquities Authority Archives (British Mandate Administrative Files ATQ_7/6 [5th Jacket: 132/126]) dating to 1946 involve the request for, and repatriation of, either thirty-seven or thirty-nine skeletons (there was some confusion as to the number) from the Oriental Institute to the Department of Antiquities. Five boxes of skeletal material, weighing several hundred pounds, were apparently sent back, but these seem to have been different from the skeletal material that is still at the Smithsonian; see letter from Hamilton to Wilson dated 5 April 1946; letter from Wilson to Hamilton dated 1 June 1946, with reply from Hamilton dated 4 July 1946.</p></li>

Everett Loud, <i>300 Years of Louds in America</i> (1980: 724), and an article by Judith Cass on p. 19 of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> on 6 September 1938 reporting on Loud’s upcoming wedding to Honor Merrell, in which they are also described as “two unusually interesting young persons.” Additional information was derived from Ancestry.com (searching for Gordon Loud and Kenneth Gordon Loud), especially from a family tree maintained by Susan Gordon Kern. He appears as “Kenneth Gordon Loud” in the 1910 US Federal Census. See also Ussishkin 2018: 63–71 for his view on Loud and his work at Megiddo, which he castigates as “disastrous”—a verdict that is too harsh since, in my opinion, Loud was better than both Fisher and Guy.</p></li>

The obituary for Ian Macpherson was published in the <i>Telegraph</i> on 12 January 2011; there is apparently also a memoir that Macpherson wrote of his experiences, entitled <i>Blurred Recollections</i>, which was privately printed in 1989, according to the obituary (see <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/8255880/Ian-Macpherson.html">https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.telegraph<wbr/>.co<wbr/>.uk<wbr/>/news<wbr/>/obituaries<wbr/>/military<wbr/>-obituaries<wbr/>/special<wbr/>-forces<wbr/>-obituaries<wbr/>/8255880<wbr/>/Ian<wbr/>-Macpherson<wbr/>.html</a>).</p></li>

Lind spent the next ten years in Sweden, trying to get financial remuneration for the loss of his land, ten thousand fruit trees, and the money in his bank accounts. Eventually he made his way to the United States in 1957 and settled in Statesboro, Georgia, where he served as a caretaker to Ed DeLoach’s elderly father. He then remarried; tried to sell his life story thinly disguised as a novel; became an American citizen in 1967; and died in 1971, the same year as Gordon Loud.

Doug Esse, who died of cancer in 1992 at the age of forty-two, had initiated the restudy of Stratum VI (see Esse 1992), which Harrison saw to completion. Other scholars have since also been engaged in additional work on other Megiddo materials, including Eliot Braun, who published a volume in 2013 specifically concerned with the East Slope excavations (Braun 2013).</p></li>
