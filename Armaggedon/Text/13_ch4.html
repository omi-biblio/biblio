      <h1 class="CTT"><b>“We Have Already Three Distinct Levels”</b></h1>

      <p class="CO">In the meantime, in terms of the archaeology that they were there to do, work at the dig continued after Higgins’s departure. By mid-July, they had constructed a wooden chute to carry debris from the top of the mound to the bottom, in anticipation that work would finally begin in that area. Railroad cars on a track carried the dirt from the digging areas to the top of the chute, while additional cars on another spur of track then took the dirt from the bottom of the chute to the dumping areas.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-1" id="chapter4_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It was an elaborate, and efficient, process.</p>

      <p class="TX">One week later, digging finally began on the top of the mound, a full three months after it had originally been scheduled to start. At first, they mostly cleared away Schumacher’s dumps and debris, but they did almost immediately find what Kellogg called “a complete [A]shtarte clay incense shrine,” which was in pieces and would have to be put back together.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-2" id="chapter4_2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Ashtarte, also called Astarte (as subsequent Chicago letters spell it) and perhaps better known as Ishtar, was the ancient Semitic goddess of fertility, venerated throughout the ancient Near East for millennia.</p>

      <p class="TX">Fisher, apparently giddy at being able to excavate without further hindrance, began laying out squares on the top of the mound. As he put it, he hoped to clear “the later, uninteresting levels out of the way, so that succeeding years could be devoted entirely to investigating the more important historical portions of the hill.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-3" id="chapter4_3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">They were working on the eastern part of the mound, reaching as far as Schumacher’s Great Trench. Part of their assignment was to clean out and connect Schumacher’s old trenches, so that they could create a new complete plan of the area. Along the way, their results showed that Schumacher had destroyed almost as much as he recovered: “Our new work on the east side shows that many strata must have been destroyed by him between the surface and his deep series of houses. In the first four meters we have <span aria-label="48" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_48" role="doc-pagebreak" title="48"></span>already three distinct levels and four if we include the Arabic tower which he cleared and removed.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-4" id="chapter4_4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">We must keep in mind that archaeology was still a relatively new discipline, as has been mentioned, and that experiments in using various methods of excavation and recording were taking place at different sites <span aria-label="49" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_49" role="doc-pagebreak" title="49"></span>across the area and the world. However, as also mentioned, Fisher was considered at the time to be one of the best archaeologists working in the Middle East. He implemented innovative approaches to excavation, including at Megiddo: “The whole area has been divided into 25-meter squares, the corners of which are marked on the ground with red topped pegs. The squares are designated with a letter and a number, running in regular sequence from North to South and East to West, thus P12, P13, Q12, Q13, etc.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-5" id="chapter4_5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This is the same system in use at Megiddo even today by the current excavation team, although the squares are now much smaller (5 m <span class="symb">×</span> 5 m).</p>

      <p class="TX">Fisher later also elaborated upon their manner of utilizing the workmen, which almost exactly mirrored the system that Schumacher had used previously at the mound. There were three large “work gangs,” with each overseen by an Egyptian foreman, and with a chief foreman (known as a <i>reis</i>) overseeing them all. Each group had three of the trained Egyptian workmen—the quftis—working with the local laborers. As Fisher put it, “a gang consists of pick-men, scrapers or basket-fillers, and a number of carriers.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-6" id="chapter4_6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">The Chicago team used local men and women, as well as boys and girls, as the basket carriers. These took the baskets full of soil, after a careful search had been made for artifacts, and carried them to the waiting railway carts. Each group had its own branch of the small railway system that the Chicago team had laid out, encircling the mound at the edge of the summit.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-7" id="chapter4_7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">However, this rather dry description doesn’t really give a sense of the action, as it were, of the dust flying as the workmen cleared each ancient room of debris and artifacts, leaving only the walls standing. There were literally hordes of these local workmen, vastly outnumbering the members of the archaeological team, sometimes at a ratio of 100:1, all supervised by the trained Egyptian overseers. The archaeologists and architects came around only when something exciting had been found or needed to be drawn.</p>

      <p class="TX">As the season progressed, days of excruciating boredom, with few finds to report, were interrupted by periods of intense activity. All staff members were expected to pull their weight, and if any slacked off or were perceived as not doing their fair share, tempers flared. Even on an excavation today, with between fifty and two hundred people working together for several weeks at a time, things can get volatile. Back then, with so few team members living and working together virtually year-round, it is no wonder <span aria-label="51" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_51" role="doc-pagebreak" title="51"></span>that there were internal conflicts and interpersonal problems more often than not.</p>

      <p class="SB1">Fisher also detailed the system used to record the architecture that they found, which was important since they were opening up huge areas at once, across a large horizontal area. When the tops of walls were revealed, the pickmen followed them down until they ascertained the room or area to which they belonged. They then gave each room or area a specific number, so that they could accurately refer to it and label it on a plan.</p>

      <p class="TX">The room or area was then excavated down to the floor level, with each artifact given a unique identification number. When the floor was reached, any objects found in situ were left in position and a photograph was taken, after which one of the trained Egyptian foremen carefully excavated and removed each artifact.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-8" id="chapter4_8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Furthermore, since the Chicago excavators planned to remove the strata one by one, in order to reach the lower levels, Fisher implemented a system that he had successfully used previously. After they had exposed an entire layer, with all of its buildings clearly visible, they would create a topographic plan and take photographs, documenting it completely and accurately, as he later explained: “Then begins the search for the next period. The gangs return to their original squares and first demolish the finished walls of the stratum, layer, or level just excavated. The work then proceeds.” It was straightforward, he said. “Thus level after level is found, thoroughly examined, and recorded as though no other period were represented on the hill. Each becomes quite simple and clear in turn.… By this method one keeps in touch with the historical sequence and feels tremendous satisfaction in seeing the story of the hill develop.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-9" id="chapter4_9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">On the one hand, Fisher’s system certainly worked to record all of Stratum I in the area they were excavating, followed by all of Stratum II lying beneath it, as well as a stratum that he called “Sub-II,” and then his Stratum III. This allowed them to get much more than just a glimpse into the levels, as would have happened if they had worked in smaller squares dug vertically rather than horizontally. It has allowed us to fairly definitively date these levels, even though Fisher’s numbering system was later changed. His “Sub-II” is now our Stratum III and dates to the Neo-Assyrian period, while Strata II and I date to the Neo-Babylonian and then the Persian periods; his Stratum III will be further discussed below (see <a href="#table002">table 2</a>).</p>

      <p class="TX"><span aria-label="52" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_52" role="doc-pagebreak" title="52"></span>However, completely removing the remains from an entire stratum so that the next one could be revealed, as Fisher did, means that no future archaeologist can come back later to check the results and conclusions. And that is why we almost never do such total removal at a site today, especially since stratigraphic levels in a mound rarely come as neatly as those in a layer cake. There are almost always pits, trenches, remodeling, renovations, and other aspects of human behavior and construction that can render both the initial excavation and the subsequent reconstruction of habitation of each level difficult.</p>

      <p class="TX">Even more problematic is when the original excavator does not keep good field notes, or any at all, as is sometimes the case. Indeed, after Guy took over from Fisher, he complained to Breasted that there were almost no notes from the previous season: “I find practically no fieldnotes dealing with the strata already laid bare,” he said. “I do not know whether Fisher has any notes with him but if he has not, there is only his memory to be relied on for a lot of evidence, and unless he can produce something the publication will not be full.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-10" id="chapter4_10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><span aria-label="53" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_53" role="doc-pagebreak" title="53"></span></p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">When Fisher finally began digging at the extreme southeastern edge of the site, he found that the two upper levels were missing entirely, so he was able to start right in on what he called Stratum Sub-II and then Stratum III. Among the interesting small finds that Fisher and his team discovered in this area were a “seal of stone which has a scene of Gilgamesh slaying a stag” and, strangely, a “Spanish dollar of Philip II dated 1588,” which was heavily coated with a gray patina and was found just under the surface. They also recovered some fifty scarabs; a number of additional coins, including some of late date that were surface finds; “many bronze arrow heads and implements”; and the largest flint collection that Fisher had ever seen.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-11" id="chapter4_11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">In addition, they came across a city wall along the side of the mound, which Fisher said was built during Stratum III and continued in use in Sub-II. He was optimistic that they would find it running around the entire circuit of the mound. The city wall was given the number 325 on the plans, by which it is still known today, though the strata were later relabeled Stratum IV and Stratum III, respectively (see <a href="#table002">table 2</a>).<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-12" id="chapter4_12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">Working right through August, they stripped the entire area between Schumacher’s trench and the eastern edge of the hill down to the Persian level by mid-September. Fisher was confident of their dating, for all of the pottery in this level dated to about 400 BCE; moreover, they had found two silver coins of Tyre, dating to 400–332 BCE (at which point Alexander the Great had conquered Tyre).<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-13" id="chapter4_13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> By early October, the light railway and chute were in operation, and they began removing the walls of Stratum II. Fisher predicted that before they closed down in November, “the whole eastern part of the Astarte temple should be laid bare.”</p>

      <hr class="transition1"/>

      <p class="SB1">Because of the excavations of both Schumacher and the Chicago excavators, there are no remains of Strata I and II left at Megiddo today. Fisher was not impressed with what they found in these top two levels anyway, though the photographs left to us show that the remains of both strata were actually fairly extensive. Overall, he said, the remains in these top two levels were “irregular and rooms of two successive periods are often built on nearly the same level, side-by-side. All are of the poorest rubble, and represent the period when Megiddo was in its decay.”<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-14" id="chapter4_14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> He also later noted that Stratum I lay so near the modern surface that most of the remains had been plowed <span aria-label="54" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_54" role="doc-pagebreak" title="54"></span>up and the stones reused in field walls by the local villagers, leaving little for the excavators to find.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-15" id="chapter4_15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

      </figure>

      <p class="TX">Fisher was correct in saying that the remains in the top two levels were not very impressive, consisting primarily of small domestic buildings constructed haphazardly, but there is one larger building that he found, which has been identified as a fortress. It still remains a matter of debate as to who first built this fortress—some have argued for Egyptians, some for Judeans, and others for Persians. Lamon and Shipton, in their <i>Megiddo I</i> volume, suggested that the destruction of this fortress, and portions of the Stratum II town, was caused by the forces of Pharaoh Necho II at the time that he <span aria-label="55" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_55" role="doc-pagebreak" title="55"></span>killed Josiah, king of Judah, at Megiddo in 609 BCE, though there is no real evidence for this.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-16" id="chapter4_16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">One thing is clear: during this time, in both Strata II and I, Megiddo was little more than an unwalled town protected only by this fortress. Its sole importance was that it was located along the route known as the Via Maris.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-17" id="chapter4_17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="TX">At the time of Josiah’s challenge, Necho was simply marching his army through the area. He was en route to a larger confrontation at Carchemish that was to determine the fate of the entire ancient Near East. Had Josiah allowed Necho and his forces to proceed unmolested, as the Egyptian pharaoh had requested, he would have lived to see another day. His religious reforms might have continued, as would his dreams of creating another kingdom like that of David and Solomon, but all came to an end in 609 BCE.</p>

      <p class="TX">Moreover, the Neo-Babylonians and their crown prince Nebuchadnezzar won at Carchemish, defeating both the Egyptians and the Neo-Assyrians. The balance of power shifted immediately, as the Neo-Babylonians established the next empire ruling over the area, including destroying Jerusalem in 586 BCE and taking the king, his family, and high-ranking officials to far-off Mesopotamia. Their rule did not last even a century, though, and soon, when Cyrus the Great captured Babylon in 539 BCE, the Persians became the next great empire to rule over the entire Near East. Cyrus allowed the exiled Judahites to return home from Babylon, where they had spent nearly five decades by that point, and the cities in the region, from Megiddo to Jerusalem and beyond, became Persian vassals, having long since lost their independence.</p>

      <p class="TX">The end of this final phase at Megiddo—that is, the end of Stratum I—seems to date to about 350 BCE, give or take a few decades, according to both Fisher and Guy.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-18" id="chapter4_18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> The ancient site lay abandoned, but it is not clear why. At least one scholar has suggested that the city ended in a blaze of glory and destruction by Alexander the Great and his Macedonian army in about 331 BCE,<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-19" id="chapter4_19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> but there is no evidence for such a cinematic finale. It seems more likely that Alexander’s men marched past an unoccupied mound, if indeed they ever swung far enough inland en route from Tyre to Egypt to even catch a glimpse of the ancient site. Later inhabitants lived elsewhere in the valley, of course, both near the ancient mound and farther away, but Megiddo’s day had ended.</p>

      <p class="TX">By the time the Romans established a camp for the Sixth Legion near the foot of the mound in the early centuries of the first millennium CE, <span aria-label="56" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_56" role="doc-pagebreak" title="56"></span>the ancient site of Megiddo had slipped into obscurity: uninhabited, used primarily as a cemetery by the Roman legionnaires, and no longer the object of fierce battles for control of the region. These were now fought elsewhere in the Jezreel Valley for the next fifteen hundred years or more, from the coming of Islam in the seventh century CE through the crusaders and Saladin, the Mongols and the Mamelukes, and the Ottomans.<sup><a href="33_notes.html#chapter4-20" id="chapter4_20" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> It was only with World War I and then the 1948 Israeli War of Independence that Megiddo came alive again with the sound of men, horses, and the clamor of battle. But the mound itself was never again the location of a living, breathing site after the Persian period, more than twenty-three hundred years ago.</p>
