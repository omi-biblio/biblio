  <p class="normal">The translations of Psalm 6 and of Proverbs 31 are from Samuel Sandmel, The Hebrew Scriptures, An Introduction to Their Literature and Religious Ideas (New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1963). Psalm 33 was specially translated by Dr. Sandmel. The Psalms of Ascent were translated for this book by scholars in Israel.</p>

  <p class="normal">Other Biblical quotations are from the King James Version, except the words of St. Paul, which are taken from II Timothy 4:7–8 in the Revised Standard Version, and those passages from Deuteronomy specifically noted, which are from The Torah, the Five Books of Moses. A new translation of The Holy Scriptures according to the Masoretic Text</p>

  <p class="normal">(Philadelphia, The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1962).</p>

  <p class="normal">The response which appears has been adapted with permission from Rabbi Ephraim Oshry, Responsa from the Depths (Brooklyn, 1959).</p>

  <p class="normal">Archaelogical drawings used throughout the book are the work of Ruth Ovadia, research scholar in the Department of Archaeology, Hebrew University, Jerusalem. Four of these drawings were adapted from illustrations in The Guide to Israel, by Zev Vilnay (Jerusalem, 1963).</p>

  <p class="normal">Certain Jewish documents are cited from C. K. Barrett, The New Testament Background: Selected Documents (New York, Harper and Brothers, 1961).</p>

  <p class="normal">Direct quotations from the sayings of Rabbi Akiba have been adapted either from the tractate Pirke Abot of the Mishna or from the excellent life by Louis Finkelstein, Akiba, Saint, Scholar and Martyr (reprinted by arrangement with World Publishing Co., New York—A Meridian Book).</p>

  <p class="normal">Quotations from and references to the Pirke Abot tractate of the Mishna are taken principally from Judah Goldin, The Living Talmud (New York, The New American Library, 1957).</p>

  <p class="normal">Quotations from and references to the Babylonian Talmud are taken principally from Leo Auerbach, The Babylonian Talmud (New York, Philosophical Library, 1944).</p>

  <p class="normal">Quotations from and references to the Jerusalem Talmud are taken principally from Dagobert Runes, The Talmud of Jerusalem (New York, Philosophical Library, 1956).</p>

  <p class="normal">Quotations from Maimonides have been for the most part adapted from Leon Roth, The Guide for the Perplexed: Moses Maimonides (London, Hutchinson’s University Library, 1947).</p>

  <p class="normal">For the list which opens the second section of Level III, I am indebted to Professor Cecil Roth of Jerusalem, who drew my attention to the fact that a list like this originally appeared in a little-known work, Wolf’s Jews in the Canary islands. Roth’s version of this list appears in his History of the Marranos, by Cecil Roth (reprinted by arrangement with World Publishing Co., New York—A Meridian Book).</p>

  <p class="normal">Details of Judenstrasse life appearing in the third part of Level III are verified principally by Marvin Lowenthal, The Jews of Germany (New York, Longmans, Green, 1936). By permission of David McKay Co., Inc</p>

  <p class="normal">Level I, 1948 CE – Bullet from a British rifle <br />Level II, about 1875 CE – Turkish gold coin <br />Level III, about 1550 CE – Golden Menorah <br />Level IV, about 1290 CE – Seal of the Crusader Volkmar VIII  <br />Level V, about 1125 CE – Headstone of the Crusader Volkmar I  <br />Level VI, about 640 CE – Muslim Tracery with superimposed Christian panel  <br />Level VII, about 350 CE – Stone from a Synagoge reused in a Church  <br />Level VIII, about 70 CE – Roman coin  <br />Level IX, about 5 BCE – Glass phial  <br />Level X, about 165 BCE – Strigil  <br />Level XI, about 600 BCE – Babylonian armament  <br />Level XII, about 1000 BCE – Horned altar <br /> Level XIII, about 1400 BCE – Clay pots <br /> Level XIV, about 2000 BCE – Clay figure of the Goddess Astarte <br /> Level XV, about 10.000 BCE – Flint sickle  <br />Level IX, about 70.000 BCE – Burial (shells and necklace flints enlarged)  <br />Level XXV, about 200.000 BCE – Hand axe </p>

  <p class="normal">This is a novel. Its characters and scenes are imaginary except as noted. The hero, Rabbi Akiba, was a real man who died as described in 137 C.E. All quotations ascribed to him can be verified. King David and Abishag, Herod the Great and his family, General Petronius, Emperor Vespasian, General Josephus and Dr. Maimonides were also real persons and quotations ascribed to the last are also verifiable. Akko, Zefat and Tiberias are existing places in the Galilee and descriptions of these towns are accurate, but Makor, its site, its history and its excavation are wholly imaginary. </p>
