  <h2>CHAPTER 120<br/>The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch</h2>

  <p class="normal"><i>Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">“We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.—By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e’en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!”</p>
