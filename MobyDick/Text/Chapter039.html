  <h2>CHAPTER 39<br/>First Night-Watch</h2>

  <p>Fore-Top.</p>

  <p>(<i>Stubb solus, and mending a brace</i>.)</p>

  <p>Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, <i>wise</i> Stubb—that’s my title—well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—</p>

  <pre>      We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light,
         To love, as gay and fleeting
      As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim,
         And break on the lips while meeting.
</pre>

  <p>A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(<i>Aside</i>) he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job—coming.</p>
